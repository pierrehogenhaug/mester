### $950,000,000


### EMRLD Borrower LP Emerald Co-Issuer Inc.

$950,000,000      % Senior Secured Notes due 2031

EMRLD Borrower LP, a Delaware limited partnership (the “Issuer”), and Emerald Co-Issuer Inc., a direct subsidiary of the Issuer (the “Co-Issuer” and, together with the Issuer,
the “Issuers”), are offering $950,000,000 aggregate principal amount of their      % senior secured notes due 2031 (the “notes”). The notes will bear interest at a rate of      %
per annum. The Issuers will pay interest on the notes semi-annually in cash in arrears on       and       of each year, beginning on     , 2025.  The notes will mature
on     , 2031.

The Issuers intend to use the proceeds of this offering and borrowings under the New Term Loan B Facility (as defined herein), together with cash on hand, to repurchase, pursuant
to the Note Purchase Agreement (as defined herein), certain unsecured notes issued by the Seller Notes Issuer (as defined herein) to subsidiaries of Emerson Electric Co.
(“Emerson”) having an aggregate principal amount of $2,345.0 million (the “Seller Notes”) (such repurchase of the Seller Notes, the “Seller Notes Repurchase”) and/or for general
corporate purposes and to pay fees, costs and expenses related to this offering.

Unless the Seller Notes Repurchase is consummated simultaneously with this offering, the Issuer will deposit (or cause to be deposited) the gross proceeds from this offering into
an escrow account for the notes for the benefit of the holders of the notes. The release of the escrowed funds will be subject to the Escrow Release Conditions (as defined herein)
set forth in the Escrow Agreement (as defined herein). If the consummation of the Seller Notes Repurchase does not occur on or prior to the Outside Date (as defined herein) or if
the Issuer notifies the Escrow Agent (as defined herein) that, in its reasonable judgment, the Seller Notes Repurchase will not be consummated on or prior to the Outside Date or
that the Note Purchase Agreement has been terminated, the Issuer must redeem the notes on the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (as defined herein) at the Special Mandatory
Redemption Price (as defined herein), pursuant to the terms of the indenture that will govern the notes. See “Description of Notes—Escrow of Gross Proceeds; Special Mandatory
Redemption.”

At any time prior to     , 2027, the Issuers may redeem some or all of the notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus
a make-whole premium, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. At any time on or after     , 2027, the Issuers may redeem
some or all of the notes at the applicable redemption prices set forth in this offering memorandum, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.
In addition, at any time prior to     , 2027, the Issuers may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes with an amount not to exceed the net cash proceeds
from certain equity offerings at the redemption price set forth in this offering memorandum, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. In
addition, at any time prior to     , 2027, the Issuers may redeem up to 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes during each calendar year following the issuance of
the notes at a redemption price of 103% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. See
“Description of Notes—Optional Redemption.”

The notes will be guaranteed, jointly and severally, by EMRLD Guarantor LP, a Delaware limited partnership (“Holdings”), the direct parent of the Issuer, and each of the Issuer’s
wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries (the “guarantors”) that guarantee our Senior Secured Credit Facilities (as defined herein) (other than the Co-Issuer) (the
“guarantees”). The notes and guarantees (i) will be secured on a senior priority basis by security interests in the Fixed Asset Priority Collateral (as defined herein) and on a junior
priority basis by security interests in the ABL Priority Collateral (as defined herein), in each case, subject to certain limitations and permitted liens and (ii) will rank equally in
right of payment with all of the Issuers’ and the guarantors’ senior indebtedness, without giving effect to collateral arrangements, and effectively equal to all of the Issuers’ and
the guarantors’ senior indebtedness secured on the same priority basis as the notes, including our Term Loan Facilities (as defined herein). The notes and the guarantees will be
effectively subordinated to any of the Issuers’ and the guarantors’ (i) indebtedness that is secured by assets that do not constitute collateral for the notes to the extent of the value
of the assets securing such indebtedness and (ii) indebtedness that is secured by a senior-priority lien, including our Revolving Credit Facility, to the extent of the value of the
ABL Priority Collateral. The notes and the guarantees will be effectively senior to any of the Issuers’ and guarantors’ unsecured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the
assets securing the notes. The notes and the guarantees will be structurally subordinated to the indebtedness, claims of holders of preferred stock and other liabilities of any
subsidiary of the Issuer (other than the Co-Issuer) that is not a guarantor of the notes. See “Description of Notes—Security for the Notes.”


**_Investing in the notes involves a high degree of risk. See “Risk Factors” beginning on page 12._**

**Offering price:     %, plus accrued interest, if any, from       , 2024**


The notes and the guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or the securities laws of any other
jurisdiction. The notes are being offered and sold in the United States only to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the
Securities Act (“Rule 144A”) and to certain non-U.S. persons in transactions outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act (“Regulation S”).
Prospective purchasers that are qualified institutional buyers are hereby notified that the sellers of the notes may be relying on the exemption from Section 5 of the Securities Act
pursuant to Rule 144A. For a description of certain information about eligible offerees and restrictions on transfers of the notes, see “Transfer Restrictions” and “Plan of
Distribution.”

The notes and the guarantees will not be entitled to any registration rights and we will not be required to complete a registered exchange offer or shelf registration of the notes and
the guarantees.

There is currently no public market for the notes. The notes will not be listed on any securities exchange or automated quotation system.


The initial purchasers expect to deliver the notes to investors only in book-entry form through the facilities of The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) for the benefit of its
participants, including Euroclear Bank SA/NV (“Euroclear”) and Clearstream Banking, société anonyme (“Clearstream”), on or about     , 2024.

**Notice to Investors**

**The Issuers and the guarantors have not, and the initial purchasers and their affiliates and agents**
**have not, authorized any person to provide any information or represent anything about us other than what**
**is contained in this offering memorandum. The Issuers and the guarantors do not, and the initial purchasers**
**and their affiliates and agents do not, take any responsibility for, and can provide no assurance as to the**
**reliability of, any information that others may provide to you. None of the Issuers, the guarantors or the**
**initial purchasers is making an offer to sell these notes in any jurisdiction where the offer or sale is not**
**permitted. The information contained in this offering memorandum speaks only as of the date of the**
**document containing such information. Our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and**

It is expected that delivery of the notes will be made against payment therefor on or about the date specified
on the cover of this offering memorandum, which is the      business day following the date of pricing of the
notes (such settlement cycle being referred to as “T+     ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in one
business day unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to
trade the notes prior to the date that is one business day preceding the settlement date will be required, by virtue of
the fact that the notes initially will settle in T+    , to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any


-----

such trade to prevent failed settlement. Purchasers of the notes who wish to trade the notes during such period
should consult their own advisor.

This offering memorandum is highly confidential and has been prepared by us solely for use in connection
with the proposed offering of the notes described herein, and solely for use in connection with the offer of the notes
to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A and to non-U.S. persons outside

-----

The distribution of this offering memorandum and the offering and sale of the notes in certain jurisdictions

memorandum does not constitute an offer of, or an invitation to purchase, any of the notes in any jurisdiction in
which such offer or invitation would be unlawful.

**No Review by the SEC; No Registration Rights**

This offering memorandum, as well as any other documents in connection with this offering, will not be
reviewed by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). There are no registration rights
associated with the notes or the guarantees and we have no present intention to offer to exchange the notes and the
guarantees for notes and guarantees registered under the Securities Act or to file a registration statement with respect
to the notes. The indenture that will govern the notes will not be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as
amended (the “Trust Indenture Act”).

**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**

We use Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Standalone Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma
Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow to better
evaluate and manage the performance of our business and make resource allocation decisions as they provide greater
understanding with respect to the results of our operations. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin,
Standalone Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Free Cash
Flow, Adjusted Free Cash Flow and combined year ended September 30, 2023 financial data and twelve months
March 31, 2024 data, are supplemental measures that are not required by or presented in accordance with GAAP.

We evaluate our operating performance using a metric we refer to as Adjusted EBITDA. We define
Adjusted EBITDA as net earnings adjusted for interest, income tax, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) as
further adjusted to exclude certain items that impact the comparison of the performance of our businesses either
period-over-period or with other businesses as more fully described below. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated
as Adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales for the respective period. Standalone Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as
Adjusted EBITDA further adjusted for estimated standalone costs assuming we were an independent company for
the entire applicable period. We define Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA as Standalone Adjusted EBITDA further
adjusted for the estimated normalized “run-rate” benefit from pricing actions and cost savings initiatives that are
expected to be realized by the end of fiscal 2026. We present these further adjustments because they are a permitted
addback in the indenture that will govern the notes and the credit agreements that govern our Senior Secured Credit
Facilities, and they should not be viewed as a projection of future performance. We cannot assure you that any or all
of these cost savings will be achieved in the anticipated amounts or within the anticipated timeframes or at all. See
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Transactions—We may not realize the anticipated cost savings from the
Transactions.” Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated as Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA divided by net
sales for the respective period. We use Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Standalone Adjusted
EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Margin to compare our operating results
on a consistent basis.

We present Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Standalone Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma
Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Margin because we believe they assist investors and analysts
in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not
believe are indicative of our core operating performance, and we believe that these metrics provide useful
information to investors in understanding and evaluating our operating results. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted
EBITDA Margin, Standalone Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA


-----

Margin do not reflect certain cash expenses that we are obligated to make, and although depreciation and
amortization are non-cash charges, assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the
future, and Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Standalone Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA, and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Margin do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements.

We define Free Cash Flow as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. We define
Adjusted Free Cash Flow as Free Cash Flow less partnership distributions. We use Free Cash Flow and Adjusted
Free Cash Flow to evaluate our ability to generate cash that can be used for working capital requirements, interest,
repayment of indebtedness, member distributions, acquisitions, and for continued re-investment into our business.

Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Standalone Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow are not
measurements of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP. In evaluating our performance as measured by
these metrics, management recognizes and considers the limitations of these measures. Other companies in our
industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Standalone Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma
Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow differently
than we do or may not calculate them at all, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. Because of these
limitations, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Standalone Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow should not be
considered in isolation or as substitutes for net earnings or any other measure calculated in accordance with GAAP,
as applicable, and should be considered together with our GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to the
corresponding GAAP financial measures set forth in this offering memorandum.

See “Basis of Presentation and Other Information” for an explanation of the combined year ended
September 30, 2023 and the combined twelve months ended March 31, 2024 information presented herein.

**Basis of Presentation and Other Information**

This offering memorandum presents the historical consolidated and combined financial and other data of
the Climate Technologies business (the “Climate Technologies Business”) held by Emerald JV Holdings L.P., a
Delaware limited partnership (“JV NewCo”) following the closing of the transactions (the “Transactions”)
contemplated by the Transaction Agreement entered into on October 30, 2022 (collectively, the “Acquisition”) by
and among Emerson Electric Co., a Missouri Corporation (“Emerson”), BCP Emerald Aggregator L.P., a Delaware
limited partnership (“BCP Emerald”) formed by affiliates of investment funds managed by affiliates of Blackstone
Inc. (“Blackstone”), Emerald Debt Merger Sub L.L.C. and JV NewCo. All references to fiscal years in this offering
memorandum, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal years, which end on September 30.

As a result of the Transactions, a new basis of accounting was created on May 31, 2023. Accordingly, the
financial statements included elsewhere herein are separately presented for the periods before and after the
application of the new basis of accounting. The consolidated and combined financial statements of the Climate
Technology Business prior to the consummation of the Transactions on May 31, 2023, for the years ended
September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2022 and the period from October 1, 2022 to May 31, 2023 (the
“Predecessor Period”), reflect the financial position and operating results of the Climate Technologies Business
(collectively, the “Predecessor”) prior to completing the Transactions. The period commencing on May 31, 2023
(the “Successor Period”), reflects the financial position and operating results of JV NewCo and its consolidated
subsidiaries (collectively, the “Successor”) subsequent to the completion of the Transactions. Consequently, the
financial position and operating results of the Successor period are not comparable in certain respects to the financial
position and operating results of the Predecessor period. Under GAAP, we are required to present separately our
operating results of the Predecessor period ended May 31, 2023 and the Successor period. In certain instances, we
have supplemented the Predecessor and Successor period reporting with combined 2023 financial results to facilitate
a comparative discussion of the financial results for applicable periods. This combined 2023 financial data is not
required by nor presented in accordance with GAAP. They are a simple addition of Predecessor and Successor
periods and do not include any forms of adjustment.

Prior to the Transactions, the Climate Technologies Business historically operated as part of Emerson and
not as a standalone entity. The audited consolidated and combined financial statements for the years ended


-----

September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021 of the Climate Technologies Business, and included in this offering
memorandum, present the historical financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Climate
Technologies Business as if it had operated on a standalone basis subject to Emerson’s control and include all
accounts of the Climate Technologies Business and its subsidiaries and affiliates on a consolidated basis.
Intercompany transactions, profits and balances among Climate Technologies Business entities have been eliminated
in consolidation and combination. The consolidated and combined financial statements included in this offering
memorandum for the Predecessor Period were derived from Emerson’s financial statements and accounting records
and have been prepared in conformity with GAAP. Sale and purchase transactions between the Climate
Technologies Business and other Emerson affiliates for the Predecessor Period are included in the consolidated and
combined financial statements.

As a business of Emerson, prior to the closing of the Transactions, the Climate Technologies Business was
historically charged for costs directly related to its business and was allocated a portion of Emerson’s general
corporate costs. All of these costs are reflected in the consolidated and combined financial statements for the
Predecessor Period. Prior to the closing of the Transactions, the Climate Technologies Business participated in
various Emerson programs which included information technology services, employee benefits, medical insurance
and other programs. Costs associated with these programs were charged to the Climate Technologies Business based
on Emerson’s actual cost and the Climate Technologies Business’ relative level of usage.

**Industry and Market Data**

Unless otherwise indicated, information contained in this offering memorandum concerning our industry
and the markets in which we operate, including our general expectations, market position, market opportunity and
market size, is based on information from management estimates. Management estimates are derived from studies
that we have commissioned as well as from publicly available information released by independent industry analysts
and third-party sources, as well as data from our internal research, and are based on assumptions, which we believe
to be reasonable, made by us based on such data, as well as our knowledge of our industry, users, customers,
services and products. You are cautioned not to give undue weight to such estimates. While we believe the estimated
market position, market opportunity and market size information included in this offering memorandum are
generally reliable, such information, which is derived in part from management’s estimates and beliefs, is inherently
uncertain and imprecise.

**Our Company**

We are a leading global manufacturer of mission critical compressors, controls, components and solutions
to the heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and refrigeration (“HVACR”) market. We provide products that help
enhance human health and comfort, protect food quality and safety, advance energy efficiency, and create
environmentally sustainable infrastructure. Key components in an HVACR ecosystem include the compressor,
controls, the condenser and the evaporator. We provide best-in-class compressors, controls, components and
solutions for residential, commercial, industrial and transportation applications. We are the largest global
manufacturer in our served markets with approximately 40% share in overall global compression, including
approximately 70% in the North America residential heating, ventilation and air conditioning (“HVAC”) segment,
and strong positions within our non-compression offerings.

Our large installed base of more than 150 million HVAC compressor units globally drives profitable
aftermarket sales due to replacement dynamics, with approximately 80% of our net sales tied to repair or
replacement activity. Ongoing technology leadership is a key driver of our ability to capitalize on the replacement
cycle, as each successive generation of compressor provides greater cost savings, energy efficiency and higher levels
of environmental sustainability impact.

The replacement cycle is primarily driven by repair and replacement of HVACR systems. Our installed
base provides a foundation for ongoing earnings resilience as systems age and require repair or replacement. Global
regulations around the impact of refrigerants on global warming and the need for energy efficiency amplify
replacement dynamics in our business. Globally, government programs and incentives support the adoption of new,
more sustainable products creating a strong forward looking growth environment. Secular trends tied to human
health and comfort, as well as food quality, safety and sustainability drive additional demand for our compression
and solutions offerings.

As the heart of an HVAC system, the compressor is the system’s most critical component, yet represents a
small percentage of the unit cost to the consumer. For example, approximately three to five percent of the residential
HVAC unit cost is associated with the compressor, but the compressor has a mission-critical impact on function and
efficiency. Compressors enable the separation of the low-pressure side of an HVAC system, where heat is absorbed
into the refrigerant, from the high-pressure side of the system, where heat is discharged from the refrigerant to a
cooling medium (typically the ambient outside air). The compressor mechanically reduces the volume of low-side
refrigerant, thereby increasing its pressure and enabling heated refrigerant to flow to the high-pressure side of the
system, where it is cooled.


-----

We offer a variety of compressor technologies to meet customer-specific applications. Compression
technology is essential to improving system efficiency. In addition, refrigerant selection is dependent on rigorous
testing by compressor manufacturers to evaluate for performance and reliability and approve for use. Globally, the
HVACR system manufacturers are dependent upon compressor innovation to meet regulations for efficiency and
more environmentally friendly refrigerants. Because compressors are highly engineered to meet our customers’
technical requirements, we work closely with them on engineering, research and development (“ER&D”) efforts to
develop technology that meets consumer needs and complies with regulatory changes. These tightly coupled
relationships result from our industry leadership and help provide us with good forward-looking visibility to market
needs and opportunities to differentiate ourselves.

**Environmental Sustainability**

We believe compressors lie at the nexus of energy efficiency, helping build environmental sustainability
and playing a role in ESG-related trends. Environmental sustainability is inherently embedded in what we do, as we
enable our customers to set environmental sustainability goals and consistently meet or exceed ever-increasing
sustainability standards. The best compressors—the most energy efficient, the quietest, the most reliable—are also
the most environmentally sustainable and the most cost efficient for our original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”)
customers and the end users of their products. Consistently improving energy efficiency and sustainability requires
continued technological innovation which is made possible by our extensive and proven ER&D capabilities.

**_HVACR Technologies_**

The businesses within our HVACR Technologies group are leading producers of compression and related
controls and solutions for residential, commercial, refrigeration, industrial, and transport markets. Our pioneering
leadership of the scroll type of compressor enables foundational leadership across a majority of our served markets.
To meet the diverse needs of other compressor applications, we also provide hermetic, semi-hermetic, centrifugal,
screw and reciprocating compressors. The depth and breadth of our portfolio is unmatched globally, allowing us to
steward market change and innovation across a wide range of market segments and applications. Our global
HVACR Technologies group generated 84% of our total net sales and 87% of our Adjusted EBITDA for the last
twelve months ended March 31, 2024.

**HVACR Americas is our largest business unit and operates within an environment where our scroll**
technology is extremely well-suited for applications across the served market. This business unit generated 57% of
our total net sales and 59% of our Adjusted EBITDA for the last twelve months ended March 31, 2024. Our leading
positions with the largest North American OEMs serving the residential, commercial and transportation segments is
augmented by our leadership with a more fragmented set of refrigeration and industrial customers. Above and
beyond the growth that an accelerated energy efficiency and low GWP refrigerant regulatory environment is driving
for our core residential, commercial and refrigeration markets, our industrial business is well-positioned for
sustainability-driven growth within the renewable natural gas (“RNG”) segment. The industrial business is roughly
divided 50/50 between traditional industrial refrigeration applications and RNG applications. The RNG space is
growing at a double-digit compound annual growth rate the past few years and growth is expected to accelerate
given sustainability trends and the associated policies and incentives to deal with landfill and other off-gassing,
largely farm-digestor applications. We are well-positioned with key customers in this space, as well as with their
solution providers and engineering contractors. Broad heating, cooling and refrigeration needs across the Americas
region coupled with a mature regulatory environment provide a solid foundation for continued growth and
innovation opportunities.


-----

Our leadership in HVACR AMEA is driven by balanced sales between residential, commercial and
refrigeration applications. Our technology leadership in commercial, district and other heating and refrigeration
segments in China is complemented by our broad leadership positions in the rest of the region, including high
ambient temperature and residential applications in countries such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. HVACR AMEA
generated 18% of our net sales and 22% of our Adjusted EBITDA for the last twelve months ended March 31, 2024.

**HVACR Europe has historically been a strong commercial and refrigeration market and is now the fastest**
growing business unit as fossil-fueled boiler systems are being replaced by heat pump and dual fuel solutions,
applications where we are a leading compressor and solutions provider. HVACR Europe generated 9% of our net
sales and 6% of our Adjusted EBITDA for the last twelve months ended March 31, 2024.

Across the Copeland brand, as well as the Sensi, Verdant, Vilter and White-Rodgers sub-brands, we
provide products that help enhance human health and comfort, protect food quality and safety, advance energy
efficiency, and create environmentally sustainable infrastructure.

Comprising approximately 81% of our total net sales for the last twelve months ended March 31, 2024, our
HVACR market segments, including residential and commercial HVAC compression, refrigeration and related
aftermarket, and industrial, play an important role for our business (approximately 36% residential HVAC
compression, approximately 20% commercial HVAC compression, approximately 22% refrigeration and related
aftermarket, and approximately 4% industrial). In addition, for the three months ended March 31, 2024,
approximately 82% of our total net sales were generated from our HVACR compression market segment, consisting
of approximately 34% residential HVAC compression (representing a 15% decrease in year over year sales),
approximately 20% commercial HVAC compression (representing a 1% increase in year over year sales),
approximately 23% refrigeration and related aftermarket (representing a 5% increase in year over year sales), and
approximately 5% industrial (representing a 39% increase in year over year sales).

The compressor is the most critical device within the HVACR system, and the most energy-intensive
HVACR component. Each unit is engineered to meet application, segment, and customer requirements to efficiently
separate the evaporator low-pressure side of the system from the condenser high-pressure side. There are six
categories of compressor technology. We invented scroll technology and continue to innovate and scale this
technology platform. Scroll’s flexibility in modulation, superior efficiency and advantages in performance best
positions it to keep up with evolving industry technical requirements and to win share from other technology types.
While scroll is the leading technology for a majority of our served HVACR applications, certain applications are
better suited to other technologies. We have developed a full suite of technology options, including a new offering in
oil-free centrifugal, to meet a wide range of customer technology needs. Our leading portfolio across operating
parameters and served applications creates opportunities for us to leverage global ER&D efforts and to apply
learnings from one segment or region to other segments or regions thus driving productivity and improving our
ability to capture new opportunities in a timely fashion.

In addition to our compression solutions, our Electronics and Controls market segment (to be distinguished
from our Electronic and Controls business unit) generated approximately 19% of our total net sales for the last
twelve months ended March 31, 2024 and approximately 18% for the last three months ended March 31, 2024
(representing a 10% decrease in year over year sales). Our portfolio of “control” products includes perishable and
environmental monitoring solutions, control systems, thermostats, food safety instruments and software solutions.
These products support climate and energy management in residential and commercial buildings, as well as across
the cold chain.


-----

**_Customers and Distribution Channels_**

Our customers include the world’s largest HVAC system OEMs and regional and local HVAC providers,
as well as distributors, wholesalers and end users. Through our market and technology leadership and global
production capacity, we have achieved significant share with leading OEMs who represent approximately one-third
of global sales. Our approximately 800 other customers account for the other two-thirds of global sales. These longtenured OEM relationships provide long-term volume stability, scale and influence. Our highly diversified customer
base helps minimize risks associated with customer concentration.

We tailor our go-to-market strategy across the value chain to best suit specific segments and end customers.
Approximately two-thirds of our products are sold directly to OEMs globally. OEM customers seek advantages in
efficiency, applied cost and compressor performance to reduce design complexity and improve performance. We
also sell our products directly to secondary buyers such as distributors and contractors. Our strong reputation for
product quality and durability, which reduce warranty costs for OEMs and the total long-term cost of ownership for
end customers, has pull-through effects on OEMs and the entire value chain. We further collaborate with channel
influencers, such as researchers, regulators, technical schools and utility providers, to create connectivity with the
entire HVACR ecosystem. In the food retail and food service industries, we work directly with end users as well as
the OEMs to provide solutions, which are sold either to the OEM, through intermediaries or directly to the end user.

We and our customers invest significant time and resources in designing products to meet required
specifications for each application and technology platform. As a result, we are highly integrated with our
customers, augmenting our strong market position. OEMs launch new product platforms every seven to ten years,
typically in connection with new regulatory standards. These new platforms require significant redesigns that need
many years of product development and close alignment between the OEM and its compressor suppliers. This
dynamic inherently favors our company due to the long-standing, close working relationships between our
engineering teams and our key OEM customers. Between formal launches, platforms are continually modified to
reduce cost and improve efficiency and reliability. The redesign process is less significant and favors the original
compressor supplier on the OEM platform. In addition to our integration in the development cycle, we have built
channels and technical support structures with OEM partners, where they rely on us to provide aftermarket support
and continue to service the installed base. Our role as a trusted partner in customer design and manufacturing
processes has resulted in low customer turnover.

Our technological advantage, deeply integrated partnerships with OEM customers and strong quality
performance together make us indispensable to our customers and support our ability to maintain margins despite
rising input costs. Long-term volume-based agreements (“LTAs”) include mechanisms to pass through material cost
inflation in order to provide stability and resiliency. On average, LTAs are three to four years in length and
approximately one-third of our total net sales are covered by LTAs.

**_Technology Leadership_**

The ongoing cycle of periodic new platform launches and subsequent updates provides us with line of sight
into future customer technology needs, enabling us to tailor our ER&D efforts around anticipated customer
demands. In doing so, we help OEMs keep pace with and shape technology innovations in the HVACR industry. We
have developed a robust and repeatable ER&D process to enable us to be a consistent innovation pioneer. Key
capabilities include: technology discovery and maturation; front-end innovation; world class laboratories and
ecosystems; specialized technical expertise; partnerships with universities, national labs and government agencies;
regulatory agency and industry leadership; and new product development support.

With more than 1,400 engineering and ER&D employees and approximately 500,000 square feet of
engineering labs at 12 major ER&D centers worldwide, including three in Asia and five in Europe, we have
substantial infrastructure to build on our technology leadership. Our ER&D strategy is further supported by the
development of the Helix Innovation Center (the “Helix”), an industry-first space where stakeholders can innovate
at a system or ecosystem level around the industry’s biggest, most complex challenges. The Helix includes six
simulated real-world, fully functional environments allowing us to test and demonstrate our integrated solutions in


-----

-----

total annual sales in the market segments addressable by our current product offerings is approximately $13.4 billion
and such market is expected to grow at a compound annual rate of approximately 4% over the next five years.

Demand in our markets is supported by attractive macro drivers such as global regulation shifts, industrydriven sustainability goals and regulatory subsidies and incentives. Based on our current market positioning, our
global scale and flexibility of our supply chain, and our manufacturing and ER&D capabilities, we are wellpositioned to capitalize on these trends.

    - **Regulatory Changes: Regulatory changes have driven change and innovation in our industry for**
decades. However, the frequency and impact of those changes has increased in recent years. These
changes include updates to seasonal energy efficiency ratio (“SEER”) requirements (and other global
efficiency standards) and new standards on refrigerants that drive more frequent compressor and
system innovations. The complexity resulting from these changes favors our global breadth and the
depth of our engineering, technology and operations. In the United States, new efficiency regulations
went into effect January 1, 2023. In 2025, new refrigerant regulations will again drive new
compressors and systems into the market. Additional new regulations in the next seven to ten years are
anticipated. Engineering and development efforts typically begin years in advance of the applicable
regulation effective date. Our OEM customers depend on us to help them meet these requirements in a
timely fashion while simultaneously helping them innovate and differentiate to meet their
sustainability goals. Europe’s sustainability goals and their desire for energy sovereignty is driving
goals and incentives targeting the installation of 30 million new heat pumps by 2030.

    - **Heat Pump Conversion: The growth of heat pumps is expected to bring new customers into the**
HVAC market, as households convert a furnace-only or gas-only system to a heat pump. According to
a major consulting practice, consumers enjoy on average approximately $4,000 in lifetime savings
from heat pumps, supported by government subsidy programs and incentives available from utility
providers. Conversion to heat pumps is expected to be particularly strong in Europe, where high
natural gas prices are incentivizing a transition to less energy-intensive heat pumps. The European
Union (“EU”) is in the process of revising its Energy Performance Building Directive (“EPBD”) to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030, a legal obligation under the European climate law,
and make the EU climate-neutral by 2050. While the revision is still under negotiation, the EPBD is
expected to require member states to ensure that all new buildings after 2027 are zero-emission, and
set deadlines after which the use of fossil fuel heating systems in new buildings, or in major building
renovations or renovations of the heating systems, will not be permitted. Existing regulations across
nine European countries have already implemented, or will implement by 2026, fossil fuel boiler bans
in residential buildings. With the upcoming revision of the EPBD, we expect that all other EU member
states will implement similar restrictions and the scope will ultimately comprise all existing buildings.
Some countries also already provide, or are expected to provide, monetary incentives to accelerate the
transition to clean heating, including heat pumps. With strong channel benefits and an existing
customer base, the major legacy boilermakers are playing a critical role in the heat pump transition.
Our HVAC compression expertise positions us as an important partner as legacy boilermakers help to
drive heat pump adoption. Our partnership and existing share with legacy boilermakers and HVAC
OEMs positions us well to enable this transition. We are currently a leader in compression for the heat
pump segment in Europe.

    - **COVID-19 / Hybrid Working: More waking hours spent at home are expected to maintain HVAC**
usage above pre-COVID-19 levels, shortening system useful life. According to a major consulting
practice, these new working arrangements are expected to keep replacement rates elevated as
approximately 45% of employees are predicted to be in hybrid working models in the future versus
approximately 10% pre-COVID-19. HVACR industry executives also expect replacement rates to
remain elevated. Run times in 2020 were quoted as being 30% higher than 2019 levels (after adjusting
for weather), which should correlate to higher rates of replacement over time.

    - **Environmental and Population Shifts: With environmental change resulting in more extreme**
temperatures across the United States, and a population mix increasingly shifting to warmer southern


-----

states, HVAC usage has increased and is expected to continue to increase, resulting in shorter useful
lives for HVAC equipment and higher replacement rates.

**Our Key Strengths**

**_Established global leader with clear #1 market position_**

We are the #1 manufacturer of HVACR compression products in the segments and regions where we
compete, driven by technology leadership, strong brand recognition, global facilities footprint and long-term
customer relationships. We are the clear leader in terms of global scale and presence, as well as breadth and quality
of our product portfolio, and we compete against different peers in each segment and region where we operate. Our
size and scale enable operational synergies driven by our ability to leverage technology, ER&D and manufacturing
excellence across regions.

**_Unrivaled breadth and depth of product portfolio and capabilities executed through a global ER&D_**
**_supply network, and well-positioned for innovation_**

Our global manufacturing capabilities, paired with our leading portfolio of SKUs and patents, enable us to
provide what our customers need, where they need it, and when they need it. No competitor can match our global
reach across markets and segments. Our leading technology position is supported by more than 3,000 patents and
pending applications. Extensive ER&D capabilities in the United States and Asia, along with a growing ER&D
functionality in Europe, enable us to offer truly global ER&D capabilities to meet the needs of each individual
customer and application.

These capabilities, combined with our deeply integrated relationships with leading OEMs and decades of
experience have made us an industry leader in technological advancement. We work collaboratively with regulators
to understand future efficiency capability standards and we are developing the solutions to meet those standards with
the world’s leading HVACR manufacturers. Leveraging these partnerships and our global ER&D infrastructure, we
are able to take a leadership position in shaping each wave of regulatory transition.

Our deep appreciation of the end user helps us tailor our technology to each customer’s needs, bringing our
global expertise to provide local solutions. This continued technological leadership has helped make us the most
trusted name in compressor solutions. Given our manufacturing presence and ER&D capabilities, we are wellpositioned for the industry’s transition to heat pumps.

Planned and anticipated regulatory changes governing efficiency and refrigerants are expected to provide
stable, ongoing tailwinds to both price and volume. New regulations from the U.S. Department of Energy went into
effect in 2023, with energy efficiency requirements varied by region, and OEM partners are relying on us to design
products that comply with the new regulations. The anticipated transition to low-GWP refrigerants in 2025 will
require considerable engineering, given that compliant refrigerants exhibit different characteristics from existing
refrigerants, such as operating pressures and flammability.

**_Mission critical partner to a diversified global customer base characterized by long-term relationships_**

As the heart of an HVAC system, the compressor is the system’s most critical component, yet represents a
small percentage of the unit cost to the consumer. For example, approximately three to five percent of the residential
HVAC unit cost is associated with the compressor, but the product has a mission-critical impact on function and
efficiency. Compression innovation can create performance, reliability and cost advantages to system design,
therefore enabling value-based selling. Customers will pay a premium for compressors that achieve superior levels
of efficiency, enabling them to reduce other costs within the system design and resulting in an overall lower total
applied system cost.

We and our customers invest significant time and resources in designing products to meet specifications
required by each application and technology platform. As a result, we are highly integrated with our customers,
augmenting our industry leadership and helping provide us with good forward-looking visibility to market needs and


-----

opportunities to differentiate. LTAs further support revenue visibility and customer retention. Outside of the United
States, where the customer base is more diversified and fragmented, LTAs are utilized less frequently.

**_Highly engineered offering promotes customer retention through customer process integration_**

In addition to the critical nature of compressors within HVAC systems, we also serve as a critical
engineering, development, and manufacturing partner to our customers. We provide crucial services to our
customers at every stage of the product lifecycle by:

    - Helping customers develop specifications to meet new regulatory requirements

    - Innovating compressor technology to meet the requirements

    - Manufacturing units at scale and on time to support new platform launches

    - Developing updates to existing platforms in partnership with customers

    - Providing aftermarket products and services to help end-users realize the full useful lives of their
HVACR systems

Deep interconnectivity with our customers’ design and manufacturing processes helps us to provide bestin-class service and support to our customers. This deep integration incentivizes our customers to maintain their
relationships with us. Customer turnover is less than one percent historically. Our technical expertise and operational
support make us a trusted partner.

**_Resilient business model supported by established installed base and high replacement volumes_**

Replacement as a percent of sales has increased to more than 85% over the last 50 years in the North
America residential HVAC industry, with a current installed base of approximately 100 million units. Replacement
sales are more resilient and are associated with durable spend, often outperforming gross domestic product growth
rates during economic cycles. Both HVACR systems broadly and compressors specifically suffer from wear.
Compressors may be replaced to extend the life of an HVACR system. Full system replacement occurs when
HVACR units are beyond repair or when an end-user determines that the payback in higher efficiency, lower
emissions and better reliability is sufficient to warrant the cost of replacement. Repair or replacement of a unit is
non-discretionary because HVACR systems provide essential heating, cooling and refrigeration.

Our resilient recovery during the 2007-2008 Global Financial Crisis speaks to the largely non-discretionary
nature of HVAC repair and replacement. Despite an approximately 15% revenue contraction in 2009, our revenues
rebounded quickly in 2010 with more than 19% growth before returning to normalized long-term growth rates. Over
the same period, we delivered improvements in gross margin and EBITDA margin as we moved quickly to manage
costs. Our cost structure is largely variable, enabling us to preserve margin during downturns such as the 2007-2008
Global Financial Crisis, the U.S. manufacturing downturn, and the COVID-19 pandemic.

Secular industry tailwinds, including upcoming regulatory changes, heat pump conversion, shifts in
population and the impact of hybrid working, are expected to drive an increase in HVAC usage. This increase in
usage can create more wear on HVAC systems and shorten systems’ useful lives, resulting in increased repair and
replacement rates and driving further demand for replacement products supporting our long-term resilient growth.

Our business is led by a highly qualified and experienced management team. Our management consistently
delivered value to stakeholders while operating as a standalone segment of Emerson. In partnership with Blackstone,
the Copeland team continues to drive innovation and execute on operational excellence in order to capitalize on
strong industry tailwinds.

In the future, each wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiary of the Issuer
that guarantees indebtedness of the Issuers or any guarantor will guarantee the
notes, subject to certain exceptions. As of the issue date of the notes, none of
our foreign subsidiaries will guarantee the notes, and no such subsidiaries
(existing or formed in the future) are expected to guarantee the notes in the

-----

**Security .......................................... The notes and the guarantees will be secured by the Collateral (as defined in**

the “Description of the Notes”). The notes and the guarantees will be secured
on an equal priority basis with our Term Loan Facilities by the assets that
secure our Term Loan Facilities, which will consist of a senior-priority lien on
the Fixed Asset Priority Collateral (as defined in the “Description of the
Notes”), and will consist of a junior-priority lien on the ABL Priority Collateral
(as defined in the “Description of the Notes”), in each case, subject to certain
limitations and exceptions and permitted liens. The lien securing the notes on
the Fixed Asset Priority Collateral will be senior to the lien on such Collateral
securing our Revolving Credit Facility, and the lien securing the notes on the
ABL Priority Collateral will be junior to the lien on such Collateral securing
our Revolving Credit Facility. See “Description of Notes—Security for the
Notes.”

**Intercreditor Agreements ............ In connection with the issuance of the notes, the Notes Collateral Agent (as**

defined herein), the Issuers and certain other parties thereto will enter into a

31, 2023 (the “Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement”) among the notes
collateral agent for our Existing Notes (the “Existing Notes Collateral Agent”),
the collateral agent in respect of the Term Loan B Facility and Term Loan A
Facility (the “Bank Collateral Agent”), which sets forth the relative rights of,
and relationship among, the Notes Collateral Agent, the holders of the notes,
the Existing Notes Collateral agent, the holders of the Existing Notes, the Bank
Collateral Agent and the lenders under each of our Term Loan Facilities and
the applicable representative of the holders under any other equal priority lien
indebtedness in respect of the exercise of rights and remedies against the
Issuers and the guarantors. In addition, the Notes Collateral Agent, the Issuers
and certain other parties thereto will enter into a joinder to the ABL
Intercreditor Agreement, dated as of May 31, 2023 (the “ABL Intercreditor
Agreement” and together, with the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement, the
“Intercreditor Agreements”) among the Existing Notes Collateral Agent, the
Bank Collateral Agent and the collateral agent under our Revolving Credit
Facility (the “ABL Collateral Agent”), which sets forth the relative priorities of
the liens on the Collateral securing the Existing Notes, the notes offered hereby
and our Term Loan Facilities and other equal priority lien indebtedness, on the
one hand, and our Revolving Credit Facility (or any replacement facilities), on
the other hand, and the relative rights of such parties to enforce such liens. See
“Description of Notes—Security for the Notes—Equal Priority Intercreditor
Agreement” and “Description of Notes— Security for the Notes—ABL/Fixed
Asset Intercreditor Agreement.”

**Ranking ......................................... The notes will be the Issuers’ and the guarantees will be the guarantors’ senior**

secured obligations and will:

                  - rank equally in right of payment with all of the Issuers’ and each
guarantor’s existing and future senior indebtedness;

                  - rank senior in right of payment to all of the Issuers’ and each
guarantor’s existing and future subordinated indebtedness and other
obligations that expressly provide for their subordination to the notes
and the guarantees;


-----

                  - be effectively senior to all of the Issuers’ and each guarantor’s existing
and future unsecured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the
Collateral securing the notes;

                  - rank equally in priority as to the Collateral with respect to borrowings
and guarantees under our Term Loan Facilities, our Existing Notes
and any other equal priority indebtedness, to the extent of the value of
the Collateral;

                  - be effectively subordinated to any of the Issuers’ and the guarantors’
indebtedness that is secured by a senior-priority lien on the ABL
Priority Collateral, including the Revolving Credit Facility, to the
extent of the value of the ABL Priority Collateral;

                  - be effectively subordinated to any of the Issuers’ and the guarantors’
indebtedness that is secured by assets that do not constitute Collateral
to the extent of the value of such assets securing such indebtedness;
and

                  - be structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness,
claims of holders of preferred stock and other liabilities of any
subsidiary of the Issuers or a guarantor that is not a guarantor or a coissuer of the notes.

As of March 31, 2024, after giving effect to this offering, the New Term Loan
B Facility and the use of proceeds therefrom, the Issuers and the guarantors
would have had approximately $7,388.7 million in total indebtedness
outstanding (excluding approximately $9.1 million of issued and undrawn

Existing Term Loan Facilities, $3,523.2 million (equivalent) of the Existing
Notes and $950.0 million of the notes. In addition, as of March 31, 2024, we
had approximately $399.5 million of availability to incur additional secured
indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility, subject to borrowing base
capacity (after giving effect to approximately $9.1 million of letters of credit
outstanding thereunder).

**SUMMARY HISTORICAL CONSOLIDATED AND**

**COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

The following table sets forth summary historical and unaudited condensed, consolidated and combined
financial information of the Company for the periods and dates indicated.

On May 31, 2023, private equity funds managed by Blackstone Inc. acquired a majority interest in Emerald
JV Holdings L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, and its consolidated subsidiaries pursuant to the Transaction
Agreement. As a result of the Transactions, a new basis of accounting was created on May 31, 2023. Periods prior to
May 31, 2023 reflect the financial statements of Climate Technologies prior to the Acquisition (referred to herein as
the “Predecessor” period). Periods subsequent to May 31, 2023, reflect the financial statements of the Company
after the Acquisition (referred to herein as the “Successor” period). The Company’s assets and liabilities were
adjusted to fair value on the closing date of the Acquisition. Due to the change in the basis of accounting, the
consolidated and combined financial statements for the Predecessor and the consolidated financial statements for the
Successor are not comparable.

The summary historical consolidated and combined balance sheet data as of September 30, 2022 (Predecessor)
and the summary historical consolidated balance sheet data as of September 30, 2023 (Successor), the consolidated
statement of operations data for the four months ended September 30, 2023 (Successor) and the consolidated and
combined statements of operations data for the eight months ended May 31, 2023 (Predecessor) and for the years
ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 (Predecessor), the consolidated statement of cash flows data for the four
months ended September 30, 2023 (Successor) and the consolidated and combined cash flows data for the eight
months ended May 31, 2023 (Predecessor) and for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 (Predecessor) have
been derived from the Company’s audited consolidated and combined financial statements included elsewhere in
this offering memorandum. The summary historical unaudited condensed and consolidated balance sheet data as of
March 31, 2024 (Successor) and the unaudited condensed and consolidated statements of operations data for the
three months ended March 31, 2024 (Successor), the three months ended March 31, 2023 (Predecessor), the six
months ended March 31, 2024 (Successor) and the six months ended March 31, 2023 (Predecessor) and the
combined twelve months ended September 30, 2023 and the unaudited condensed and consolidated statements of
cash flows data for the six months ended March 31, 2024 (Successor) and the six months ended March 31, 2023
(Predecessor) have been derived from the Company’s unaudited condensed and consolidated financial statements
(Successor) and the unaudited condensed, consolidated and combined financial statements (Predecessor) included
elsewhere in this offering memorandum. The summary unaudited condensed and consolidated statements of
operations data for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024 have been derived by taking the consolidated statement
of operations data for the four months ended September 30, 2023 (Successor) and the consolidated and combined
statements of operations data for the eight months ended May 31, 2023 (Predecessor), adding the unaudited
condensed and consolidated statements of operations data for the six months ended March 31, 2024 and subtracting
the unaudited condensed and consolidated statements of operations data for the six months ended March 31, 2023.

The unaudited condensed and consolidated financial statements (Successor) and the unaudited condensed,
consolidated and combined financial statements (Predecessor) have been prepared on the same basis as the audited
consolidated and combined financial statements and, in the opinion of management, include all adjustments,
consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of the results for those periods. Results for
the three and six months ended March 31, 2024 (Successor) and for the three and six months ended March 31, 2023
(Predecessor) are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full fiscal year or any future
reporting period.

The historical results presented below are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any
future period. The following historical and unaudited condensed, consolidated and combined financial information is
only a summary and should be read in conjunction with “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations” and our historical consolidated and combined financial statements and the
notes thereto included elsewhere in this offering memorandum, as well as the information included under the
headings “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” “—The Transactions,” “Risk Factors” and
“Capitalization.”

(a) Represents non-cash stock-based compensation expense.
(b) Represents non-recurring product liability expense.
(c) Restructuring costs represent costs related to productivity initiatives within our facilities associated with production, as well as automation
processes and transfer of certain support functions into lower cost locations.
(d) Allocation adjustments represents an adjustment to add back the corporate overhead costs, including trademark and trade name charges,
allocated to the Climate Technologies Business in our historical financial statements. These costs are not representative of what they would
have been if we operated as a standalone entity during such periods.
(e) Pension expenses added back are comprised of the non-service cost components of the charges related to the Company’s pension plans.
(f) Represents non-cash expense for asbestos charge.
(g) Transaction expenses represent one-time expenses related to the Acquisition, including $50.0 million related to due-diligence costs, legal

fees, and advisor charges; $52.0 million related to a breakage fee from alternative standby debt financing; $25.2 million related to buyer
stand-up costs, $20.5 million related to the representation and warranty insurance policy.
(h) Represents non-recurring, non-cash expense related to inventory step up and above or below market lease agreements associated with
GAAP purchase accounting.


-----

(i) Represents the gain on the sale of the Chanhassen, Minnesota Cold Chain facility recognized in April 2023.
(j) Represents discrete addback for separation costs related to the Acquisition, primarily associated with IT, accounting, and finance advisor
fees, as well as $1.8 million of real estate transfer taxes.
(k) Other adjustments relate to various non-recurring and non-operating items such as inventory adjustments and out-of-period warranty claims,
as well as estimated one-time expenses such as bonus catch-up expenses, corporate overhead, consultancy fees, and setup costs for various
functions like tax, accounting, human resources, treasury, legal, and IT.
(l) Represents a loss on debt extinguishment related to the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs and discount of the Original Term Loan
B as a result of the Term Loan B refinancing during February 2024.
(m) Represents estimated standalone costs for items such as corporate costs, consulting charges, and costs to stand up tax, accounting, human

resources, treasury, legal, compliance, benefits, information technology and other administrative functions. For the historical Predecessor
periods where we do not present an adjustment for such estimated standalone costs, we estimate that such standalone costs would have been
approximately $51.3 million for the years ended September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021.
(n) Represents an adjustment to reflect the estimated normalized “run-rate” benefit from pricing actions and cost saving initiatives that are
expected to be realized by the end of fiscal 2026. Note that these assumptions and estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to
significant business, operational, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the
Transactions—We may not realize the anticipated cost savings from the Transactions.”

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the notes involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described_
_below and all of the information included in this offering memorandum before deciding whether to purchase the_
_notes. Any of the following risks may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and_
_financial condition. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and uncertainties that we_
_face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also_
_materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In such a case, you may_
_lose all or part of your original investment. The risks discussed below also include forward-looking statements, and_
_our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. See “Special_
_Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial_
_Condition and Results of Operations” in this offering memorandum._

**Risks Related to Our Business**

**_Our business is subject to competitive pressures that could affect prices or demand for our products. In_**
**_particular, the HVACR market may experience periods of structural imbalance between supply and demand that_**
**_result in periods of pricing volatility, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial_**
**_condition, and results of operations._**

We operate in markets that are highly competitive and potentially volatile, and we compete on the basis of
product performance, quality, service and/or price across the industries and markets served. Other factors that affect
competition in the HVACR market include the development and application of new technologies, an increasing
emphasis on the development of more efficient products and new product introductions. Our operations are
significantly dependent on the current and future business environment (including capital and consumer spending)
and on public funding. A significant element of our competitive strategy is to deliver solutions to our customers by
manufacturing high-quality products at the best relevant global cost. Various companies compete with us in one or
more product lines and the number of competitors varies by product line. Some of our competitors may have greater
financial resources than we have, allowing them to invest in more extensive research and development and/or
marketing activity and making them better able to withstand adverse market conditions, and we also compete with
many smaller companies. There has been consolidation and new entrants (including non-traditional competitors)
within our industry and there may be future consolidation and new entrants which could result in increased
competition and significantly alter the dynamics of the competitive landscape in which we operate. Also, the
establishment of manufacturing operations in low-cost countries could provide cost advantages to existing and
emerging competitors. There is always the risk of disruptive technologies coming from companies that are not
traditionally manufacturers or service providers of our products. Competitive pressures could adversely affect prices
or customer demand for our products, impacting our sales or profit margins, and/or resulting in a loss of market
share.

We also believe that the HVACR market may, from time to time, experience periods of structural
imbalance between supply and demand, and that any such excess capacity will put pressure on pricing. Such supply
and demand may also be influenced by trade measures and policies, government regulations, public funding, raw
material availability, and supply chain disruptions. There may be additional pressure on global demand and average
selling prices in the future resulting from fluctuating demand in certain major markets. If our competitors reduce
pricing to levels near or below their manufacturing costs, or are able to operate at minimal or negative operating
margins for sustained periods of time, or if global HVACR demand decreases relative to installed production
capacity, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.

**_Our operating results depend in part on continued successful research, development and marketing of new_**
**_and/or improved products and services, and there can be no assurance that we will continue to successfully_**
**_introduce new products and services._**

The success of new and improved products and services depends on their initial and continued acceptance
by our customers. Our business is affected by varying degrees of technological change and corresponding shifts in
customer demand, which result in unpredictable product transitions, shortened life cycles and increased importance
of being first to market with new products and services. The development and commercialization of new products


-----

and the modification of existing products and services to meet customer demands require a significant investment of
resources and an anticipation of the impact of new technologies and the ability to compete with others who may
have superior resources in specific technology domains. We may experience difficulties or delays in the research,
development, production and/or marketing of new products and services which may negatively impact our operating
results and prevent us from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to continue to bring new
products and services to market. Further, investment in a product or service could divert our attention and resources
from other projects that become more commercially viable in the market.

We must anticipate and respond to market and technological changes driven by broader trends such as
decarbonization and electrification efforts and the use of low global warming potential refrigerants in response to
climate change. Market growth from the use of cleaner energy sources, as well as emissions management, energy
efficiency, lower greenhouse gas refrigerant usage, and decarbonization efforts are likely to depend in part on
technologies not yet deployed or widely adopted today. We may not adequately innovate or position our business for
the adoption of technologies such as battery storage solutions, hydrogen use cases in industry, mobility, and power
generation, enhanced electrical grid demand management, carbon capture and sequestration or advanced nuclear
power.

These trends and the relative competitiveness of our product and service offerings will continue to be
impacted by uncertain factors such as the pace of technological developments and related cost considerations, the
levels of economic growth in different markets around the world and the adoption of climate change-related policies
such as carbon taxes, greenhouse gas emission reductions, incentives or mandates for particular types of energy, or
policies that impact the availability of financing for certain types of projects.

**_Any failure to obtain, maintain, protect or enforce our intellectual property and other proprietary rights, could_**
**_harm our competitive position and our business._**

Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain, maintain, protect and enforce our intellectual property
and other proprietary rights. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well
as certain contractual rights, such as confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with employees and third
parties, and license and other agreements with consultants, vendors and customers. However, these laws and
agreements provide only limited protection and may not be adequate to protect any of our intellectual property rights
from being challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed, diluted or misappropriated. Further, efforts to monitor
the infringement, misappropriation or other violation of our intellectual property rights by third parties are difficult,
expensive, and time-consuming, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevent infringing products
from being manufactured without our knowledge and consent.

We rely on our trademarks, service marks, trade names and brand names to distinguish our services and
solutions from those of our competitors. We have registered or applied to register many of these trademarks, but our
trademark applications may not mature to registration or we may not be able to otherwise obtain adequate trademark
protection. Also, third parties have brought, and may in the future bring opposition, cancellation or similar
adversarial proceedings against our trademark registrations and applications, or otherwise challenge our use of our
trademarks. In the event that our trademarks are successfully challenged, we could be forced to rebrand our
products, which could result in loss of brand recognition and could require us to devote resources to develop,
advertise and market new brands.

We have applied for, and may continue to apply for, patents relating to our solutions and technology. The
patenting process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to file and/or prosecute all necessary or
desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner or pursue or obtain patent protection in all
relevant markets. When we do apply for patents, we cannot assure you that our applications will be successful and
result in the issuance of any patents or that the scope of the patents that do issue will provide adequate protection
from competition. Furthermore, because the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope,
validity or enforceability, it is possible that patents issued to us may be challenged successfully and narrowed in
scope or found to be invalid or unenforceable in the future.

We also rely upon trade secrets and other proprietary information to protect our products and technology,
including in cases where intellectual property may not be registrable, or we believe intellectual property is best


-----

protected by means that do not require public disclosure. For example, our proprietary scroll machining technology,
which we believe is a key component to maintaining a competitive advantage in the scroll compressor market, is
primarily protected as a trade secret. However, trade secret protection is risky and uncertain, and the disclosure or
independent development of our proprietary technology could have a material adverse impact on our business and
results of operations. We seek to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through confidentiality
and invention assignment agreements with our employees and third parties, as well as through other security
measures. However, these agreements and security measures may be inadequate to protect our trade secrets and
other proprietary information. We cannot guarantee that we have entered into such agreements with every party that
has or may have had access to our trade secrets or other proprietary information and, even if entered into, these
agreements may be breached or otherwise fail to effectively prevent disclosure of trade secrets or other proprietary
information, may be limited as to their term and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized
disclosure or use of trade secrets or other proprietary information. We have limited control over the protection of
trade secrets used by our third-party manufacturers and suppliers and could lose future trade secret protection if any
unauthorized disclosure of such information occurs. Further, enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or
misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and a favorable outcome is not
guaranteed. In addition, if any of our trade secrets or other proprietary information were lawfully obtained or
independently developed by a third party, we would not have legal recourse to prevent such third party, or those to
whom they communicate such technology or information, from using that technology or information to compete
with us. Our intellectual property rights and the enforcement or defense of such rights may be affected by
developments or uncertainty in laws and regulations relating to intellectual property rights. Moreover, many
companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign
jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the
enforcement of patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property protection, which could make it difficult for us
to stop the infringement, misappropriation or other violation of our intellectual property or marketing of competing
products in violation of our intellectual property rights generally.

If we do not obtain sufficient protection for our intellectual property, or if we are unable to effectively
maintain, protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitiveness could be impaired, which would
limit our growth and future revenue. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**_We may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, which could be_**
**_expensive, time consuming, and unsuccessful, and any claims that we infringe, misappropriate or otherwise_**
**_violate third parties’ intellectual property rights could have a material and adverse effect on our business._**

From time to time, legal action by us may be necessary to protect and enforce our intellectual property and
other proprietary rights, which could be costly, time-consuming and distracting to management. Furthermore, our
efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims, and countersuits
attacking the validity, scope and enforceability of our intellectual property rights, which could result in the
impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property.

We have in the past, and may in the future, be subject to claims by third parties alleging that we have
infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated their intellectual property rights. Furthermore, we cannot guarantee
that the operation of our business does not and will not infringe or violate the rights of third parties. Any litigation or
proceedings to defend ourselves against allegations of infringement, misappropriation, or other violations of
intellectual property rights, regardless of merit, could be costly, divert attention of management and may not
ultimately be resolved in our favor. If we are unable to successfully defend against claims that we have infringed the
intellectual property rights of others, we may be prevented from using certain intellectual property or offering
certain products, or may be liable for damages, which in turn could materially adversely affect our business,
financial condition or results of operations. We may also be required to acquire or develop an alternative, noninfringing product, which could be costly, time-consuming or impossible, or seek a license from a third party, which
may not be available on terms that are favorable to us, or at all. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_We may engage in acquisitions, divestitures or other strategic transactions, which are subject to domestic and_**
**_foreign regulatory requirements, and may encounter difficulties in integrating, separating and managing these_**
**_businesses and therefore we may not realize the anticipated benefits._**

We may enter into acquisitions or other strategic transactions, including partnerships, joint ventures or
strategic alliances, as well as evaluate our portfolio for potential divestitures. These activities require favorable
environments to execute these transactions, and we may encounter difficulties in obtaining the necessary regulatory
approvals in both domestic and foreign jurisdictions. In addition, competition for strategic transactions in the
industries in which we operate has escalated during recent years, and may increase costs of such transactions or
cause us to refrain from entering into certain such transactions. There can be no assurance that we will identify or
successfully complete transactions with suitable candidates in the future, that we will consummate these transactions
at rates similar to the past or that completed transactions will be successful. Strategic transactions may involve
operational or other changes, significant cash expenditures, debt incurrence, assumed or retained liabilities,
operating losses and expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results
of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, we may not realize the degree, or timing, of benefits we anticipate when
we first enter into a transaction. Such transactions involve numerous other risks, including:

    - diversion of management time and attention from daily operations;

    - difficulties integrating or managing acquired businesses, technologies and personnel into our business
and cooperating with strategic partners, including doing so without high costs;

    - difficulties separating divested businesses and potential continued financial involvement in the
divested business through transition services arrangements, guarantees, indemnifications or other
financial arrangements;

    - difficulties managing strategic investments;

    - difficulties in obtaining and verifying the financial statements and other business and other due
diligence information of acquired businesses;

    - inability to obtain required regulatory approvals and/or required financing on favorable terms;

    - potential loss of key employees, key contractual relationships or key customers of either acquired
businesses or our business;

    - inability to verify ownership of the intellectual property of the acquired businesses and difficulties
associated with the ownership of intellectual property such as dependence on licenses from third
parties, potential infringement upon intellectual property rights of others or expected acceptance of the
technology in the marketplace;

    - assumption of the liabilities and exposure to unforeseen or undisclosed liabilities of acquired
businesses and exposure to regulatory sanctions;

    - inheriting internal control deficiencies; and

    - in the case of joint ventures and other investments, partnerships or alliances, interests that diverge from
those of our partners without the ability to direct the management and operations of the joint venture or
investment in the manner we believe most appropriate to achieve the expected value.

Any of the foregoing could have an adverse effect our business, financial condition, results of operations
and cash flows.

**_We use a variety of raw materials and components in our business, and significant shortages or price increases_**
**_could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products._**

Our major requirements for raw materials include steel, copper, cast iron, electronics, aluminum, brass and,
to a lesser extent, plastics and petroleum-based chemicals. We seek multiple sources of supply for each of our major
requirements in order to avoid significant dependence on any one or a few suppliers. However, the availability and
prices for raw materials, parts and components may be subject to curtailment or change due to, among other things,
suppliers’ allocation to other purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers, changes in exchange rates and
prevailing price levels. In addition, our facilities, supply chains, distribution systems and products may be impacted
by natural or man-made disruptions, including armed conflict, damaging weather or other acts of nature, pandemics
or other public health crises or other events. A shutdown of, or inability to utilize, one or more of our facilities, our
supply chain or our distribution system could significantly disrupt our operations, delay production and shipments,
damage our relationships and reputation with customers, suppliers, employees and others, result in lost sales, result
in the misappropriation or corruption of data, or result in legal exposure and large remediation or other expenses.
Significant shortages or price increases therefore could impact the prices we charge, our operating costs and the
competitive position of our products and services, which could adversely affect our results of operations. While we
monitor market prices of the commodities we require and attempt to mitigate price exposure through hedging
activities, this risk could adversely affect our operating results.

**_Our operations depend on production facilities throughout the world, many of which are located outside the U.S._**
**_and subject to increased risks of disrupted production, causing delays in shipments and loss of customers and_**
**_revenue._**

We manage manufacturing facilities worldwide, many of which are located outside the U.S., including in
Mexico, parts of Europe and Asia, and also source certain materials globally. Markets outside the U.S. represent a
significant percentage of our total sales and serving a global customer base requires that we place more materials
sourcing and production in emerging markets to capitalize on market opportunities and maintain a best-cost position.
Our and our suppliers’ non-U.S. production facilities and operations could be disrupted by weather and natural
disasters (including the potential effects of climate change), labor strife, war (including the Russia-Ukraine conflict
and Israel-Hamas conflict), political unrest, terrorist activity, power outages, fires, explosions, equipment failures,
sabotage, cybersecurity incidents, labor disputes, critical supply failure, inaccurate downtime forecast or public
health concerns such as an epidemic or pandemic, particularly in emerging countries that are not well-equipped to
handle such occurrences.

Our manufacturing facilities abroad are dependent on the stability of governments and business conditions
and may be more susceptible to changes in laws, policies and regulations in host countries, as well as economic and
political upheaval, than our domestic facilities. These facilities face increased risks of nationalization as well as
operational disruptions which could cause delays in shipments of products and the loss of sales and customers, and
insurance proceeds may not adequately compensate us.

**_Access to additional funding may be required for the execution of our business plan, and if we are unable to_**
**_maintain such access we could experience a material adverse effect on our business and financial results._**

Our ability to invest in our business, undertake strategic transactions and refinance our debt obligations as
they mature may require access to the debt markets and sufficient bank credit lines to support borrowings. Volatility
in the debt markets and the tightening, unavailability or increased cost of credit may increase costs associated with
incurring debt, or affect our ability to access those markets. If financial markets were to deteriorate, or costs of
capital were to increase significantly due to a lowering of our credit ratings, prevailing industry conditions, the
volatility of the debt markets or other factors, we may be unable to obtain new financing on acceptable terms, or at
all. Additionally, if our customers, suppliers or financial institutions are unable to access the debt or equity markets
to meet their commitments to us, our business and financial results could be adversely impacted. A deterioration in
our financial performance could also limit our future ability to access amounts available under our Senior Secured
Credit Facilities.


-----

**_We may be required to make significant cash contributions to our defined benefit pension plans._**

We sponsor defined benefit pension plans under which certain eligible employees will earn pension
benefits. We have plans in several countries including the U.S. The terms of the U.S. plans require, and the terms of
the non-U.S. plans may require, that such qualified defined benefit pension plans maintain certain capitalization
levels. Changes in discount rates and actual asset returns different than our anticipated asset returns can result in
significant non-cash actuarial gains or losses. With regard to cash pension contributions, funding requirements for
our pension plans are largely dependent upon interest rates, actual investment returns on pension assets and the
impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension funding obligations. Our pension plan contributions
may be material and could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
We may need to make pension plan contributions in future periods sufficient to satisfy funding requirements.

**_Our operations can be adversely affected by our ability to attract, motivate, develop, and retain our employees,_**
**_labor shortages and work stoppages, turnover, labor cost increases and other labor relations problems._**

Our success depends in part on the efforts and abilities of our management and key employees. Their skills,
experience and industry knowledge significantly benefit our operations and performance. We have experienced, and
could continue to experience, high employee turnover and absenteeism, particularly in manufacturing and
distribution locations, as a result of COVID-19 related concerns and other factors. A number of factors may
adversely affect the labor force available or increase labor costs, including high employment levels, related
competition, and federal unemployment subsidies, such as unemployment benefits offered in response to the
COVID-19 pandemic. Some of our operations are in sparsely populated, largely rural and agricultural areas that
have experienced, and continue to experience, population decline. Sustained population decline in these areas could
lead to increased costs, such as increased compensation expense to attract and retain qualified employees. These
concerns have decreased the pool of available qualified talent for certain functions. The failure to attract, develop
and retain highly qualified personnel could adversely affect our ability to succeed in our human capital goals and
priorities as well as negatively impact our business and operating results.

In April 2024, the Federal Trade Commission issued a final rule that would prevent employers from
entering into non-competes with employees after the effective date of the final rule (presently September 4, 2024)
and would invalidate existing non-competes for all but the most senior executives. The final rule is subject to legal
challenge and a motion to stay the effective date of the final rule during the pendency of the legal challenge will be
decided by July 3, 2024. Consequently, this rule could negatively impact our ability to enforce post-termination
non-compete clauses in existing agreements and would prevent the entering into such post-employment restrictions
going forward. If a non-compete agreement is challenged and/or found to be unenforceable, we may be unable to
prevent the formerly employed employee from competing with us, potentially resulting in the loss of some of our
business.

In addition, as of September 30, 2023, approximately 9% of our workforce in the U.S. and 29% in
international locations were represented by an employee representative organization, such as a union, works council
or employee association. The results of future negotiations with unions are uncertain. Temporary work stoppages,
union negotiations, labor disputes and other matters associated with our labor force could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_Security and/or data privacy breaches, or disruptions of our information technology systems could adversely_**
**_affect our business._**

We rely on information technology networks and systems, including those of third parties, to collect, use,
process, transmit and store electronic information, including personal, sensitive and other confidential information,
and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities. These technology networks and systems
may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing
software, databases or components; power outages; telecommunications or system failures; terrorist attacks; natural
disasters; employee error or malfeasance; server or cloud provider breaches; and computer viruses or cybersecurity
incidents. Cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain
unauthorized access to information technology networks and systems to more sophisticated and targeted measures,
known as advanced persistent threats, directed at us, our products, our customers and/or our third-party service


-----

providers. Despite the implementation of cybersecurity measures (including access controls, data encryption,
vulnerability assessments, continuous monitoring, and maintenance of backup and protective systems), our
information technology systems may still be vulnerable to cybersecurity threats and other electronic security
breaches. It is possible for such vulnerabilities to remain undetected for an extended period. In addition, it is possible
a security breach could result in theft of trade secrets or other intellectual property or unauthorized access, use,
modification, disclosure, loss or theft of personal, sensitive or confidential data, including customer, supplier or
employee information. We cannot guarantee that our security efforts, or those of our third-party vendors, will
prevent or timely detect attacks or any resulting breaches, breakdowns or compromises of data or systems, react in a
timely manner, or implement adequate preventative or remedial measures. Any cybersecurity incidents or threat
affecting us or our third-party service providers, including those that result in data or security breaches, could have
an adverse effect on our operations, as well as expose us to investigations, notification requirements, litigation,
liability or penalties under privacy laws, increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs, reputational
damage and product failure.

In addition, we must comply with increasingly complex and rigorous regulatory standards enacted to
protect business and personal data in the U.S. and elsewhere. Compliance with privacy and localization laws and
regulations increases operational complexity. Although we work to comply with applicable laws, regulations and
standards, our contractual obligations and other legal obligations, these requirements are evolving and may be
modified, interpreted and applied in an inconsistent manner from one jurisdiction to another, and may conflict with
one another or other legal obligations with which we must comply. Any actual or perceived failure to comply with
such requirements or adequately address privacy and security concerns, even if unfounded, could subject us to fines
and penalties, as well as legal and reputational risks, including proceedings against us by governmental entities or
others.

**_Our products and services are highly sophisticated and specialized, and a major product failure or similar event_**
**_caused by defects, cybersecurity incidents or other failures, could adversely affect our business, reputation,_**
**_financial position and results of operations._**

Many of our products, including compressors, gas valves and other control products are incorporated into
complex systems and contain refrigerants that can be flammable or otherwise dangerous, utilize high electrical
currents, control explosive gases and utilize lithium ion batteries. As a result, the impact of a catastrophic product
failure or similar event could be significant and result in serious injury, death or significant property damage. If
certain of our product and service offerings do not meet applicable safety standards or our customers’ expectations
regarding safety or quality, we can and have experienced lost sales and increased costs and we can and have been
exposed to legal, financial and reputational risks. Actual, potential or perceived product safety concerns could
expose us to litigation as well as government enforcement actions, which has also occurred in certain instances. In
addition, when our products fail to perform as expected, we are exposed to warranty, product liability, personal
injury and other claims.

Our products and services also incorporate hardware and software and process data across various
information technology systems and with other devices. Our software, hardware, systems and devices may contain
security vulnerabilities, malware, software bugs, errors or other defects that are difficult to detect or correct,
particularly when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. While we have built
operational processes to ensure that our product design, manufacture, performance and servicing meet rigorous
quality standards, there can be no assurance that we or our customers or other third parties will not experience
operational process or product failures and other problems, including through manufacturing or design defects,
process or other failures of contractors or third-party suppliers, cybersecurity incidents or other intentional acts, that
could result in potential product, cybersecurity, safety, regulatory or environmental risks. For example,
cybersecurity incidents aimed at the software embedded in our products could lead to third-party claims resulting
from damages caused by our product failures, and this risk is enhanced by the increasingly connected nature of our
products. See “—Security and/or data privacy breaches, or disruptions of our information technology systems could
adversely affect our business.”

In many jurisdictions, product liability claims are not limited to any specified amount of recovery. If any
such claims or contribution requests or requirements exceed our available insurance or if there is a product recall,
there could be an adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, a recall or claim could require us to


-----

review our entire product portfolio to assess whether similar issues are present in other products, which could result
in a significant disruption to our business and which could have a further adverse impact on our business, financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows. There can be no assurance that we will not experience any material
warranty or product liability claims in the future, that we will not incur significant costs to defend such claims or
that we will have adequate reserves to cover any recall, repair and replacement costs.

**_If our goodwill, other intangible assets and long-lived assets become impaired, we may be required to record a_**
**_significant charge to earnings._**

We test, at least annually, the carrying value of goodwill for impairment, as discussed in Note 1. Summary
_of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. We review other_
intangible assets and long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of the assets may not be recoverable. The estimates and assumptions about future results of operations and
cash flows made in connection with the impairment testing could differ from future actual results of operations and
cash flows. If the assumptions used in our analysis are not realized or if there was an adverse change in facts and
circumstances, it is possible that an impairment expense may need to be recorded in the future. If the fair value of
our reporting units falls below its carrying amount because of reduced operating performance, market declines,
changes in the discount rate, or other conditions, expenses for impairment may be necessary. Any such expenses
may have a material negative impact on our results of operations. There were no impairment expenses taken during
the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021.

**_Our results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted by the loss of major customers._**

From time to time in the past we derived a significant portion of our sales from a limited number of
customers, and such concentration may continue in the future. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, our top
five customers accounted for approximately 46% of our total revenue. The loss of, or significant reduction in sales
to, one or more major customers or groups of customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations, financial condition and cash flows. Further, the addition of new major customers in the future could
increase our customer concentration risks as described above.

**_Natural disasters, epidemics or other unexpected events may disrupt our operations, adversely affect our results_**
**_of operations, cash flows or financial condition and may not be fully covered by insurance._**

The occurrence of one or more natural disasters, power outages or other unexpected events, including
hurricanes, fires, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, floods and other forms of severe weather, health
epidemics, pandemics (including the COVID-19 pandemic) or other contagious outbreaks, conflicts, wars or
terrorist acts, in the U.S. or in other countries in which we or our suppliers or customers operate could adversely
affect our operations and financial performance. Natural disasters, power outages or other unexpected events could
damage or close one or more of our facilities or disrupt our operations temporarily or long-term, such as by causing
business interruptions or by affecting the availability and/or cost of materials needed for manufacturing. Existing
insurance arrangements may not cover all the costs or lost cash flows that may arise from such events. The
occurrence of any of these events could also increase our insurance and other operating costs or harm our sales.
Natural disasters, epidemics or other unexpected events may also affect our ability to obtain necessary raw materials
and parts or ship finished products to customers, and the ability of our customers to pay for our products and
services or to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations, which could result in a decrease and/or
cancellation of orders and/or payment delays or defaults. Such events may impact our supply chain by causing
disruptions and delays in shipments of certain materials or components of our products. Further, such conditions
may also adversely affect our supply base and increase the potential for one or more of our suppliers to experience
financial distress or bankruptcy, which could impact our ability to fulfill orders on time or at the anticipated cost.

**_Our substantial sales and operations both in the U.S. and abroad subject us to economic risk as our results of_**
**_operations may be adversely affected by changes in government regulations and policies and currency_**
**_fluctuations._**

We sell, manufacture, engineer and purchase products globally, with significant sales in both mature and
emerging markets. We expect sales in non-U.S. markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our total


-----

sales. Our U.S. and international operations subject us to changes in government regulations and policies in a large
number of jurisdictions around the world, including those related to trade, investments, taxation, exchange controls
and repatriation of earnings. Risks related to international operations include exchange control regulations, wage and
price controls, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, antitrust regulations, employment regulations,
foreign investment laws, import, export and other trade restrictions (such as sanctions and embargoes), differing
levels of protection of intellectual property, taxation, regulations and policies related to repatriation of earnings, acts
of industrial espionage, violations by our employees of anti-corruption laws (despite our efforts to mitigate such
risk), changes in regulations regarding transactions with state-owned enterprises, nationalization of private
enterprises, acts of terrorism, acts of war, civil strife, and our ability to hire and maintain qualified staff and maintain
the safety of our employees in these regions. Instability and uncertainties arising from the global geopolitical
environment and the evolving international and domestic political, regulatory, and economic landscape, including
the potential for changes in global trade policies, such as sanctions and trade barriers, and trends such as populism,
economic nationalism and negative sentiment toward multinational companies, as well as the cost of compliance
with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations worldwide, can impair our flexibility in modifying
product, marketing, pricing, or other strategies for growing our business, as well as our ability to improve
productivity and maintain acceptable operating margins.

Changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade, trade restrictions or barriers, tariffs or
taxes, trade protection measures, and retaliatory countermeasures, including on imports from countries where we
manufacture products, could adversely impact our business and financial results. In addition, changes in the relative
values of currencies occur from time to time and have affected our operating results and could do so in the future.

In addition, a geopolitical conflict in a region where we operate could disrupt our ability to conduct
business operations in that region. Beyond tariffs and sanctions, countries also could adopt other measures, such as
controls on imports or exports of goods, technology, or data, which could adversely affect our operations and supply
chain and limit our ability to offer our products and services as intended. These kinds of restrictions could be
adopted with little to no advanced notice, and we may not be able to effectively mitigate the adverse impacts from
such measures. Political uncertainty surrounding trade or other international disputes also could have a negative
impact on customer confidence and willingness to spend money, which could impair our future growth.

Operating outside the U.S. also exposes us to additional intellectual property risk. The laws and
enforcement practices of certain jurisdictions in which we operate may not protect our intellectual property rights to
the same extent as in the U.S. and may impose joint venture, technology transfer, local service or other foreign
investment requirements, and restrictions that potentially compromise control over our technology and proprietary
information. Failure of foreign jurisdictions to protect our intellectual property rights, an inability to effectively
enforce such rights in foreign jurisdictions, or the imposition of foreign jurisdiction investment or sourcing
restrictions or requirements could result in loss of valuable proprietary information and could impact our business,
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_Currency exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results._**

We are exposed to a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in currency exchange rates.
Approximately 42% of our net sales for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024 was derived outside the U.S., and
we expect such sales to continue to represent a significant portion of our net sales. While we monitor our exchange
rate exposure and attempt to mitigate this exposure through hedging activities, this risk could adversely affect our
operating results.

We also translate assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses denominated in non-U.S. dollar currencies into
U.S. dollars for our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements based on applicable exchange rates.
Consequently, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar compared to other currencies may have a material impact
on the value of these items in our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements, even if their value has not
changed in their original currency.

**_The military conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and Israel and Hamas have created a humanitarian crisis,_**
**_materially impacted economic activities, and may materially impact our global and regional operations._**

The global economy has been negatively impacted by the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine.
Governments including the U.S., United Kingdom, and those of the EU have imposed export controls on certain
products and financial and economic sanctions on certain industry sectors and parties in Russia which has triggered
retaliatory sanctions by the Russian government and its allies. The outcome and future impacts of the conflict
remain highly uncertain, continue to evolve and may grow more severe the longer the military action and sanctions
remain in effect. Risks associated with the Russian-Ukrainian conflict include, but are not limited to, adverse effects
on political developments and on general economic conditions, including inflation and consumer spending;
disruptions to our supply chains; disruptions to our information systems, including through network failures,
malicious or disruptive software, or cybersecurity incidents; trade disruptions; energy shortages or rationing that
may adversely impact our manufacturing facilities and consumer spending, particularly in Europe; rising fuel and/or
other costs of producing, procuring and shipping our products; our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate
fluctuations; and constraints, volatility or disruption in the financial markets.

When Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, we immediately began evaluating the legality of and risks
associated with continued business with Russia and Belarus versus our contractual commitments to customers in
those countries and our desire to continue supporting our employees within Russia. On May 9, 2022 we made the
decision to stop accepting new orders from Russia and Belarus, but continued fulfilling already accepted orders
where we were legally permitted to do so. We also began the process of disposing of our business operations in
Russia. As of March 14, 2023, we stopped fulfilling any remaining open orders with Russia and Belarus and have
now exited all business activity within these markets. To date, the Russia-Ukraine conflict has not had a material
adverse effect on our business or financial performance.

In addition, since October 7, 2023, the hostilities in Israel and the Gaza Strip have further heightened global
tensions and instability. At this time, it is unknown whether hostilities in this region will escalate into an even larger
conflict. A prolonged war or an escalation of the current conditions in Israel could bring about adverse effects on
political developments and on general economic conditions, including inflation and consumer spending and
disruptions to our supply chains, which could in turn adversely affect our business operations and financial
performance.

We have no way to predict the progress or outcome of the situations in Ukraine or Israel. Until there are
peaceful resolutions, the conflicts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows.

**_Recessions, adverse market conditions or downturns in end markets we serve may negatively affect our_**
**_operations._**

In the past, our operations have been exposed to significant volatility due to changes in general economic
conditions or consumer preferences, recessions or adverse conditions in the end markets we serve. In the future,
similar changes could adversely impact overall sales, operating results (including potential impairment charges for
goodwill or other long-lived assets) and cash flows. Moreover, during economic downturns we may undertake more
extensive restructuring actions, including workforce reductions, global facility optimizations, centralization of
certain business support activities, and other cost reduction initiatives, and incur higher costs. As these plans and
actions can be complex, the anticipated operational improvements, efficiencies and other benefits might be delayed
or not realized.

Our business and financial performance is also adversely affected by decreases in the general level of
economic activity, including decreases in performance of the construction industry in the U.S., Europe and
worldwide. For example, construction and other capital investment projects are heavily dependent on general
economic conditions, localized demand for real estate and availability of credit, public funding or other sources of
financing. Some of the real estate markets we serve are prone to significant fluctuations in supply and demand. For
example, our sales in the residential and commercial new construction markets correlate to the number of new
homes and buildings that are built, which in turn is influenced by cyclical factors such as interest rates, inflation,
availability of financing, consumer spending habits and confidence, employment rates and other macroeconomic


-----

factors over which we have no control. Our sales may not improve, or improvement may be limited or lower than
expected. In addition, our financial performance may be influenced by the production and utilization of transport
equipment, including tractor-trailer and shipping container production cycles in North America and Europe.

Recent developments affecting the financial services industry and the resulting market volatility could also
have an adverse impact on our business. The recent interest rate increases by the U.S. Federal Reserve (the “Federal
Reserve”) have contributed to significant market volatility and the Federal Reserve has signaled that there will likely
be additional interest rate increases. The recent and anticipated increases are in response to inflation rising at a rate
not seen in decades. This rising rate environment and the speed with which it is anticipated to be implemented could
materially affect our results of operations. Additionally, during the course of 2023, Silicon Valley Bank (“SVB”)
failed and was taken into receivership by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; Signature Bank and Silvergate
Capital Corp. (“Silvergate”) were each swept into receivership; a syndicate of U.S. banks infused $30 billion in First
Republic Bank; and it was announced that UBS Group AG would be acquiring Credit Suisse Group AG (“Credit
Suisse”), with support from the government of Switzerland, following the deterioration of the financial condition of
Credit Suisse, all in an attempt to reassure depositors and calm fears of a banking contagion. Although we do not
hold any cash or maintain any accounts at, nor do we have any other relationships with SVB, Signature Bank or
Silvergate, if other banks and financial institutions enter receivership or become insolvent in the future in response
to financial conditions affecting the banking system and financial markets, our ability to access our existing cash,
cash equivalents and investments may be threatened, which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_The reduction, elimination, or expiration of government subsidies, economic incentives, tax incentives, energy_**
**_efficiency and/or related targets, and any other support relevant to the HVACR market, or the impact of other_**
**_public policies, such as tariffs or other trade remedies, could negatively impact demand and/or price levels for_**
**_our products and limit our growth or lead to a reduction in our net sales or increase our costs, thereby adversely_**
**_impacting our operating results._**

While we believe that HVACR will experience growth through the adoption of products like heat pumps, in
certain markets, our net sales and profits remain subject to variability based on the availability and size of
government subsidies and economic incentives. Federal, state, and local governmental bodies in many countries
have provided subsidies in the form of subsidies, rebates, tax incentives, and other incentives typically provided to
(or imposed upon) end users, distributors, and installers. Many of these support programs expire, phase down over
time, require renewal by the applicable authority, or may be amended (including delays of previously announced
subsidies). To the extent these support programs are reduced earlier than previously expected, are changed
retroactively, are not renewed, or are unexpectedly delayed, such changes could negatively impact demand and/or
price levels for our products, lead to a reduction in our net sales, and adversely impact our operating results.

**_Failure to increase productivity through sustainable operational improvements, as well as an inability to_**
**_successfully execute repositioning projects or to effectively manage our workforce, may reduce our profitability_**
**_or adversely impact our business._**

Our profitability and margin growth are dependent upon our ability to drive sustainable improvements. We
seek productivity and cost savings benefits through repositioning actions and projects, such as consolidation of
manufacturing facilities, transitions to cost-competitive regions, and product line rationalizations. Risks associated
with these actions include delays in execution, additional unexpected costs, realization of fewer than anticipated
productivity improvements, and adverse effects on employee morale. We may not realize the full operational or
financial benefits we expect, the recognition of these benefits may be delayed, and these actions may potentially
disrupt our operations. In addition, organizational changes, increased attrition, failure to create and implement a
succession plan for key positions, not retaining key talent, inability to attract new employees with unique skills,
trends in rising labor costs and labor availability, labor relations difficulties, or workforce stoppage could have a
material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial position, and results of operations.

**_Demand for our HVACR products and services is influenced by weather conditions and seasonality._**

Demand for our HVACR products and services is seasonal and affected by the weather. Cooler than normal
summers depress sales of our replacement air conditioning products and services and warmer than normal winters


-----

have the same effect on our heating products. Historically, sales to residential HVACR customers tend to be higher
in the second and third quarters of the year because, in the U.S. and other northern hemisphere regions, spring and
summer are the peak seasons for sales of air conditioning systems and services. In these circumstances, the results of
any quarterly period may not be indicative of expected results for a full year, and unusual weather patterns or events
could positively or negatively affect our business and impact overall results of operations.

**_Changes in tax rates, laws or regulations and the resolution of tax disputes could adversely impact our financial_**
**_results._**

As a global company, we are subject to taxation in the U.S. and numerous non-U.S. jurisdictions.
Significant judgment is required to determine our consolidated income tax provision and related liabilities. Our cash
flows and operating results could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with different statutory
tax rates, as well as by changes in the local tax laws and regulations, or the interpretations thereof. The taxes
associated with our operations and organizational structure could be impacted by changes in tax or other laws,
treaties or regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof by the U.S. or non-U.S. tax or other governmental
authorities. Even after legislation is enacted, further guidance, regulations and technical corrections pertaining to the
legislation continue to be issued by the tax authorities, some of which may have retroactive application. We continue
to monitor and review new guidance and regulations as they are issued, as any changes could have a material
adverse effect on our financial statements. In addition, governmental authorities are actively engaged in formulating
new legislative proposals. Any future legislative changes to the tax laws and judicial or regulatory interpretation
thereof, the geographic mix of earnings, changes in overall profitability, and other factors could also materially
impact our effective tax rate.

Effective with the Transactions, substantially all U.S. operations are owned by an entity treated as a
partnership for U.S. tax purposes, which generally is not subject to U.S. income tax. This results in an effective tax
rate for the Successor period that is significantly lower than the Predecessor periods, because in such prior periods
the U.S. operations were owned by an entity treated as a corporation for U.S. tax purposes, and thus were subject to
U.S. income tax. If the Company’s structure were to change in the future, this could have a material impact on
entity level taxes.

We continue to monitor for other tax changes, U.S. (including state and local) and non-U.S. related, which
can also adversely impact our overall tax burden. From time to time, proposals have been made and/or legislation
has been introduced to change the tax laws, regulations or interpretations thereof of various jurisdictions or limit tax
treaty benefits that if enacted or implemented could materially increase our tax burden and/or effective tax rate and
could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has released proposals to create an agreed set of
international rules for fighting base erosion and profit shifting, including Pillar One and Pillar Two, such that tax
laws in countries in which we do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis, and any such changes
could adversely impact us. On December 12, 2022, the EU member states agreed in principle on the introduction of
a global minimum tax rate (proposed at 15%). On December 15, 2022, the European Council formally adopted the
Council Directive on ensuring a global minimum level of taxation for multinational and large-scale domestic groups
in the EU member states (the “Directive”), meaning that the Directive was transposed into EU member states’
national law by the end of 2023, entering into effect beginning January 1, 2024. As a consequence, our global
effective tax rate could be materially impacted by such legislation, or any resulting local country legislation enacted
in response to any potential global minimum tax rates.

In addition to the above, the European Commission has been very active in investigating whether various
tax regimes or private tax rulings provided by a country to particular taxpayers may constitute state aid. We cannot
predict the outcome of any of these potential changes or investigations in any of the jurisdictions, but if any of the
above occurs and impacts us, this could materially increase our tax burden and/or effective tax rate and could have a
material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

While we monitor proposals and other developments that would materially impact our tax burden and/or
effective tax rate and investigate our options, we could still be subject to increased taxation on a going forward basis
no matter what action we undertake if certain legislative proposals or regulatory changes are enacted, certain tax


-----

treaties are amended and/or our interpretation of applicable tax or other laws is challenged and determined to be
incorrect.

In addition, our tax returns are subject to regular review and audit by U.S. and non-U.S. tax authorities.
These examinations on their own, or any subsequent litigation related to the examinations, may result in additional
taxes or penalties against us. While we believe our tax provisions are appropriate, the final outcome of tax audits or
disputes could result in adjustments to our tax liabilities, which could adversely affect our financial results.

**_Our reputation, ability to do business and results of operations could be impaired by improper conduct by any of_**
**_our employees, agents or business partners._**

We are subject to regulation under a wide variety of U.S. federal and state and non-U.S. laws, regulations
and policies, including laws related to anti-corruption, anti-bribery, export and import compliance, anti-trust and
money laundering, due to our global operations. In particular, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as
amended, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010 and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit
companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of
obtaining or retaining business, and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced government
corruption to some degree. We cannot provide assurance that our training and internal controls will always protect
us from the improper conduct of our employees, agents and business partners. Any such violation of law or
improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, could lead to
substantial civil or criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and related shareholder lawsuits, could lead to
increased costs of compliance and could damage our reputation, our business and results of operations.

**_Climate change, regulations associated with climate change, and climate change mitigation efforts could_**
**_adversely affect our business._**

The effects of climate change, including increased frequency and intensity of weather conditions and water
scarcity, create financial risks to our business. The potential impacts of climate change on our operations are highly
uncertain and depend upon the unique geographic and environmental factors present, such as rising sea levels at
certain of our facilities, changing storm patterns and intensities and changing temperature levels. The effects of
climate change could also disrupt our operations by impacting the availability and cost of materials and by
increasing insurance, energy and other operating costs. The effects of climate change also may impact our decisions
to construct new facilities or maintain existing facilities in the areas most prone to physical risks, which could
similarly increase our operating and material costs. We could also face indirect financial risks passed through the
supply chain that could result in higher prices for our products and the resources needed to produce them, or which
we may not be able to pass on to customers through increases in prices for our products. Potential adverse impacts
from climate change may create health and safety issues for employees operating at our facilities and may lead to an
inability to maintain standard operating hours.

In addition, increased public awareness and concern regarding global climate change may result in more
international, federal, and/or state or other stakeholder requirements or expectations that could result in more
restrictive or expansive requirements or standards, such as stricter limits on greenhouse gas emissions or more
prescriptive reporting or disclosure of greenhouse gas emissions or other environmental, social, and governance
metrics. There continues to be a lack of consistent climate change legislation and standards, which creates economic
and regulatory uncertainty and may result in operational or other inefficiencies. While we have adopted certain
voluntary targets, laws, regulations or standards pertaining to climate change may be adopted, changed or
accelerated that impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements on us, our products or our
customers, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

There is consensus among the international scientific community that greenhouse gas emissions are the
leading cause of human-influenced climate change, and that these emissions must be reduced dramatically to avert
its worst effects. Increased public awareness and concern about climate change will likely continue to: (1) generate
more international, regional and/or national requirements to curtail the use of high global warming potential
refrigerants (e.g., the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol and the American Innovation and Manufacturing
Act of 2020), which are essential to many of our products; (2) increase demand for energy efficient HVACR
equipment and cold chain solutions, as well as more efficient building energy management; and (3) cause a shift


-----

away from the use of fossil fuels as an energy source, including natural gas prohibitions. In some instances, these
requirements may render our existing technology (particularly some of our HVACR and refrigeration products) noncompliant or obsolete, and we may be required to make increased capital expenditures to meet new regulations and
standards, changing interpretations, and stricter enforcement of current laws and regulations, or to increase spending
on research and development for new products. Furthermore, our customers and the markets we serve may impose
emissions or other environmental standards through regulation, market-based emissions policies, or consumer
requirements or preferences that we may not be able to timely meet due to the required level of capital investment
and technology advancement. While we are committed to pursuing environmentally sustainable solutions for our
products, there can be no assurance that our development efforts will be successful, that our products will be
accepted by the market, that proposed regulations or deregulation will not have an adverse effect on our competitive
position, or that economic returns will justify our investments in new product development.

The varying and frequently changing international, regional and/or national requirements associated with
climate change regulations, including the U.S. re-entrance into the Paris Climate Agreement, also create economic
and regulatory uncertainty and may result in operational or other inefficiencies. There is also regulatory and
budgetary uncertainty associated with government incentives, which, if discontinued, could adversely impact the
demand for energy-efficient buildings and could increase costs of compliance.

**_We are subject to litigation that could adversely impact our operating results._**

We are, and may in the future be, a party to a number of legal proceedings and claims, including those
involving intellectual property, product liability (including asbestos) and compliance, and environmental, health and
safety matters (including toxic torts), several of which claim, or may in the future claim, significant damages. While
we do not believe that any pending matters are likely to be material to the us, given the inherent uncertainty of
litigation, we can offer no assurance that existing litigation or a future adverse development will not have a material
adverse impact.

**_We are subject to environmental laws, rules and regulations that could adversely impact our operating results._**

We are subject to various foreign, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including
those relating to environmental protection and the use, handling, treatment, storage, discharge into the environment,
and disposal of materials, substances and wastes used or generated in our manufacturing processes. Environmental
laws and regulations are frequently revised and have generally become more stringent over time. Compliance with
these laws and regulations is a significant factor in our business. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur
expenditures to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with applicable
environmental laws, regulations and permit requirements could result in civil or criminal fines or penalties or
enforcement actions, including regulatory or judicial orders suspending or enjoining operations or requiring
corrective measures, installation of pollution control equipment, or remedial actions.

We are currently, and may in the future be, required to incur costs relating to the investigation or
remediation of the environmental condition of property (including current and former manufacturing sites and
properties and third-party sites, where wastes generated by our operations, or those of our predecessors have been
disposed of), and for addressing environmental conditions, as well as for associated liabilities, including liabilities
for natural resource damages, third party property damage or personal injury. Some environmental laws and
regulations, including the U.S. Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act
of 1980, as amended, (“CERCLA”), and comparable state statutes, impose liability and responsibility on present and
former owners, operators or users of facilities and sites for contamination at such facilities and sites without regard
to fault or the causation or knowledge of, or the legality of the conduct that contributed to, contamination. Liability
under CERCLA is retroactive, and, under certain circumstances, liability for the entire cost of a cleanup can be
imposed on any responsible party. Environmental conditions relating to our former, current or future sites, or those
of predecessor companies whose liabilities we may have retained, assumed or acquired, have resulted in and may, in
the future, result in additional obligations to undertake investigation, remediation or monitoring activities that could
cause us to incur significant future costs and expenditures and become subject to unanticipated claims or liabilities.
At facilities with past or ongoing remedial actions, we may incur additional liabilities related to discovery of
previously undetected contamination or resulting from the promulgation of new or more stringent cleanup standards
(including for so-called “emerging contaminants”).


-----

In addition, business decisions related to our facilities, including consolidations, expansions, dispositions or
closures, may require environmental investigations that have resulted in and may, in the future, lead to discoveries
of contamination or trigger compliance requirements. We cannot assure you that existing or future circumstances,
the discovery of new information, or the failure of third parties to address contamination at current or former
facilities or properties will not require us to incur significant expenditures in excess of the financial reserves that we
have established for our presently anticipated remedial obligations.

We may also be subject to increasingly stringent laws and regulations concerning the use, import and
export, and content of chemicals and hazardous substances (including, without limitation, per- and polyfluoroalkyl
substances) in our products, including, without limitation, the United States Toxic Substances Control Act, the
European Union’s Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemical Substances directive and the
Restriction of Hazardous Substances directive, California Proposition 65, and similar or more stringent laws and
regulations in other jurisdictions. These product compliance laws and regulations may require, among other things,
the testing and registration of substances that are incorporated into, or that form a part of, our products; limit or
require us to phase out or eliminate use of certain designated substances; the identification or development of
substitute substances or technologies; or impose labelling or warning requirements on our products with respect to
certain designated substances. We could also be subject to significant fines or other civil and criminal penalties
should we fail to comply with these laws and regulations. There can be no assurance that current or future product
compliance laws and regulations will not impose costly requirements upon us or have a material impact on our
capital expenditures, earnings, financial condition, or competitive position. Additionally, public scrutiny or
consumer concerns regarding the use of certain chemicals and hazardous substances could negatively impact our
ability to sell products containing such chemicals and hazardous substances.

**_Increasing interest and expectations with respect to environmental, social, and governance matters by our_**
**_various stakeholders could adversely affect our business and operating results._**

In response to evolving customer, investor, employee, governmental, and other stakeholder interest in our
environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) practices, we may adopt and/or update our ESG goals or targets. Our
ability to achieve any new or updated ESG goals and aspirations will be subject to numerous risks and uncertainties,
many of which are dependent on the collective efforts of others or may be outside of our control. Such risks include,
among others, the availability and adoption of new or additional technologies that reduce carbon or eliminate energy
sources on a commercially reasonable basis, competing and evolving economic, policy and regulatory factors, the
ability of suppliers and others to meet our environmental sustainability, diversity and other goals, the availability of
qualified candidates in our labor markets and our ability to recruit and retain diverse talent, and customer
engagement with our goals. There may be times where actual outcomes vary from those aimed for or expected and
sometimes challenges or changes in circumstances may delay or block progress. As a result, we cannot offer
assurances that any targeted results will be realized or achieved. Moreover, standards and expectations for ESG
matters continue to evolve and may be subject to varying interpretations (e.g., by stakeholders, customers or
regulators), which may result in significant revisions to our goals, targets or progress. In addition, certain of our
product offerings may become less attractive as standards evolve. A failure or perceived failure to meet any ESG
goals or targets or a failure or perceived failure to meet evolving stakeholder expectations and standards, could
damage our reputation, adversely affect customer or employee retention or engagement or support from our various
stakeholders, and could subject us to government enforcement actions or penalties and private litigation. Such
outcomes could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**Risks Related to the Transactions**

**_Funds affiliated with Blackstone control us and may have conflicts of interest with us or you in the future._**

Blackstone controls JV NewCo and, indirectly, the Issuer. As a result, funds affiliated with Blackstone have
control over our decisions to enter into any corporate transaction and have the ability to prevent any transaction that
requires the approval of the board of directors or equityholders of us or any of the parent companies, regardless of
whether the noteholders believe that any such transactions are in their own best interest. For example, funds
affiliated with Blackstone could cause us to make acquisitions that increase the amount of indebtedness that is
secured or to sell assets (subject to Emerson’s consent rights under the Governance Documents as described under


-----

“Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions”), which may impair our ability to make payments under the
notes.

In addition, funds affiliated with Blackstone are in the business of making investments in companies and
may, from time to time, acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. Funds
affiliated with Blackstone may also pursue acquisitions that may be complementary with our business and, as a
result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. So long as funds affiliated with Blackstone
continue to indirectly own a significant amount of the outstanding shares of our equity interests, even if such amount
is less than 50%, funds affiliated with Blackstone will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control
our decisions.

**_Prior to the Transactions, we did not operate as an independent company, and the historical financial_**
**_information presented in this offering memorandum is not necessarily representative of the results that we would_**
**_have achieved as an independent company and may not be indicative of future results._**

The formation of the Company and the consummation of the Transactions involve certain risks to our
business. The historical information about us in this offering memorandum for the Predecessor Period reflects our
business as operated by Emerson and is derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records
of Emerson. Accordingly, the combined and consolidated financial statements for the Predecessor Period may not
reflect our business’ combined results of operations, financial position and cash flows had it been a standalone
company during the periods presented and may not be indicative of those that we will achieve following the
Transactions. Actual financial results that would have been achieved for the Predecessor Period if our business had
been a standalone company would depend on multiple factors, including organizational structure and strategic
decisions made in various areas, including information technology and infrastructure, due primarily to the following
factors:

    - our business was historically operated by Emerson as part of its broader corporate organization, rather
than as an independent company. Emerson provided resources to us for the performance of various
corporate functions such as information technology, tax, accounting, human resources, benefits, legal,
compliance, treasury, insurance, finance and other administrative functions. As a result of the
separation, our costs related to such functions previously performed by Emerson may increase;

    - we have entered into agreements for new relationships with Emerson for which there was no
counterpart prior to the Transactions and therefore are not reflected in our historical results;

    - our historical financial information for the Predecessor Period does not reflect changes that we have
experienced and expect to continue to experience in the future as a result of the Transactions, including
changes in our cost structure, personnel needs, tax structure, financing and business operations. As part
of Emerson, we enjoyed certain benefits from its operating diversity, size, purchasing power, our
ability to secure favorable terms on our vendor contracts and available capital for investments, and we
may lose some of those benefits after the Transactions;

    - after the completion of the Transactions, the cost of capital for our business is expected to be higher
than Emerson’s cost of capital prior to the Transactions;

    - following the Transactions, we may be more susceptible to economic downturns and other adverse
events than if we were still a part of Emerson; and

    - certain employees who have historically performed services for both our business and for Emerson are
no longer employees of our business after the Transactions.

We may not be able to achieve the same financial results we would have achieved had our business
remained part of Emerson. Additionally, the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin,
Standalone Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Free Cash


-----

Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow contained in this offering memorandum is not made in accordance with GAAP
or with a view towards compliance with published guidelines of the SEC.

**_We may not realize the anticipated cost savings from the Transactions._**

The benefits that we expect to achieve as a result of the Transactions will depend, in part, on our ability to
realize anticipated cost savings. Our success in realizing these cost savings, and the timing of this realization,
depends on the successful transition of our business to a standalone company, among other factors. Even if we are
able to execute this transition successfully, this may not result in the full realization of the cost savings that we
currently expect, either within the expected time frame, or at all. In addition, we cannot assure you that the costs to
achieve these cost savings will not be higher than we anticipated. Therefore, we cannot assure you that any
anticipated cost savings will be achieved or that our estimates and assumptions will prove to be accurate. Adjusted
EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Standalone Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma
Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Free Cash Flow do not reflect the significant costs we expect to incur in order to
achieve such cost savings, and there can be no assurance that such costs will not be materially higher than presently
contemplated, as such costs are difficult to estimate accurately. If our cost savings are less than our estimates or our
cost savings initiatives adversely affect our business or cost more or take longer to implement than we project, or if
our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, our results could be lower than we anticipate.

**_We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant transaction costs in connection with the_**
**_Transactions._**

In connection with the Transactions, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs and
expenses, including financial advisory, legal, accounting, consulting and other advisory fees and expenses,
separation, restructuring and stand up costs, severance and employee benefit-related expenses, printing expenses and
other related charges. In addition, we incurred significant one-time charges as a result of costs associated with the
Transactions. There are also a large number of processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems
that were developed in connection with the Transactions. While we have assumed that a certain level of expenses
will continue to be incurred following the Transactions, there are many factors that could affect the total amount or
timing of the integration and implementation expenses. There may also be additional unanticipated significant costs
in connection with or following the Transactions that we do not anticipate and may not be able to recoup. These
costs and expenses could reduce the benefits we expect to achieve from the Transactions.

**_We may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the Transactions, and the Transactions may adversely_**
**_affect our business, financial condition and results of operations._**

We may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits we are anticipating from the Transactions on a
timely basis, or at all. In connection with our evaluation of the Transactions, we have estimated the costs we will
need to incur in order to operate as a standalone business after our transition services arrangements with Emerson
expire or are terminated. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully realize the expected benefits of
these initiatives. A variety of risks could cause us not to realize some or all of the expected benefits. These risks
include the establishment of standalone operations, creation of a new organizational structure, changes in processes
and information systems, dis-synergies from separation, potential client attrition and changes to our operating
model. Moreover, our continued implementation of these initiatives may disrupt our operations and performance.
These actions may not provide the expected benefits and could lead to disruption of our operations, loss of or
inability to recruit key personnel, weakening of internal standards, controls or procedures and impairment of key
customer and supplier relationships.

Further, becoming an independent company will require significant amounts of management’s time and
effort, which may divert management’s attention from operating and growing our business. If we fail to achieve
some or all of the benefits that are expected from becoming an independent company, or do not achieve them in the
time frame expected, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely
affected.


-----

**_Emerson’s historical and future actions, or failure to comply with its obligations under the Transaction_**
**_Agreement and the other agreements entered into in connection with the Transactions, may materially affect our_**
**_business, financial condition and operating results._**

Although we became an independent company as a result of the Transactions, Emerson’s historical and
future actions may still have a material impact on our business and operating results. In connection with the
Transactions, we have entered into certain agreements with Emerson, including the Transaction Agreement and the
Transition Services Agreement, under which Emerson has obligations to us. Emerson’s failure to comply with any
portion of these agreements, including certain indemnities therein, for any reason could inhibit us from operating or
expanding our business in the future and/or result in significant additional costs to us. For example, if Emerson fails
to provide necessary transitional and other commercial services, we may not be able to operate our business
effectively until we are able to perform these services on our own, which may have a material impact on our
operating results during that time. In addition, third parties could also seek to hold us directly responsible for any of
the liabilities that Emerson has agreed to retain, and there can be no assurance that the indemnity from Emerson will
be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that Emerson will be able to fully satisfy its
indemnification obligations. We could incur material additional costs if Emerson fails to meet its obligations or if
we otherwise are unable to recover costs associated with such liabilities.

In addition, we will have obligations to Emerson under certain of the agreements discussed in the above
paragraph. We may fail to perform such obligations in a timely or effective manner, or at all, during the term of such
agreements, either due to our inability or unwillingness to continue such services, our inability to provide such
services at reasonable costs or for other reasons. Any such inability or other reasons could lead to unforeseen
liabilities under the terms of such agreements or otherwise, including liabilities resulting from the inability of
Emerson to provide these services themselves or to obtain substitute arrangements with third parties. Any such
financial consequences or liabilities could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition,
results of operations and cash flows.

Further, there may be an adverse operational impact on our business as a result of the significant
management time and internal resources that will need to be dedicated to developing internal support functions and
standalone operations during the period following the Transactions. Such management time and internal resources
would otherwise be available for other business initiatives and opportunities. Each of these risks could negatively
affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_After the consummation of the Acquisition, certain of our executive officers and senior managers may have_**
**_actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their equity interests in Emerson._**

Because of their former positions with Emerson, certain of our executive officers and senior managers will
own Emerson’s common stock. This continuing ownership of such common stock by certain of our expected
executive officers and senior managers could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest if we and
Emerson pursue the same corporate opportunities or face decisions that could have different implications for us and
them. Potential conflicts of interest could also arise if we enter into any new commercial arrangements with
Emerson in the future.

**_Restrictions on our use of (or expiration of our right to use) the Emerson name, following the Acquisition could_**
**_adversely affect our business and profitability, financial condition and results of operations._**

Historically, certain of our products and services have been known as “Emerson” products and services and
we believe the association with such name has provided us with preferred status among some of our customers and
employees due to Emerson’s globally recognized brands and perceived high quality products and services. Our
separation from Emerson could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers, which could result in
reduced sales of our products.

After the closing of the Transactions, the Company has begun to transition away from use of the
“Emerson” name and associated trademarks. Subject to certain limitations and requirements, Emerson has granted
the Company a limited, non-exclusive license to continue to use the “Emerson” name and certain associated
trademarks solely in connection with specified uses during a transitional period of one year after the closing of the


-----

Transactions (subject to certain exceptions with respect to the use in connection with customer-facing software and a
leased property). However, upon the expiration of the applicable transitional time periods, the “Emerson” name and
associated trademarks must be removed from all of our public or consumer-facing materials and we will lose the
right to use the “Emerson” name and associated trademarks in connection with the marketing of any product or
service. The transition away from use of the “Emerson” name and associated trademarks may be time-consuming
and costly, and the failure of our products, technology or brands to continue to appeal to the market could have an
adverse impact on our ability to attract and retain customers and thus adversely affect our business, financial
condition or results of operations.

**Risks Related to our Indebtedness and the Notes**

**_Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition, our ability to operate our business,_**
**_react to changes in the economy or our industry, prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under the notes, pay_**
**_our other debts and could divert our cash flow from operations for debt payments. In addition, the value of the_**
**_rights of holders of the notes to the Collateral may be reduced by any increase in the indebtedness secured by the_**
**_Collateral._**

We have a substantial amount of debt, which requires significant interest and principal payments. As of
March 31, 2024, after giving effect to this offering, the New Term Loan B Facility and the use of proceeds
therefrom, the Issuers and the guarantors would have had approximately $7,388.7 million in total indebtedness
outstanding (excluding approximately $9.1 million of issued and undrawn letters of credit) none of which would
have been subordinated and all of which would have been senior secured indebtedness, consisting of $950.0 million
under the New Term Loan B Facility, $1,965.5 million of borrowings under the Existing Term Loan Facilities,
$3,523.2 million (equivalent) of the Existing Notes and $950.0 million of the notes. In addition, as of March 31,
2024, we had approximately $399.5 million of availability to incur additional secured indebtedness under the
Revolving Credit Facility, subject to borrowing base capacity (after giving effect to approximately $9.1 million of
letters of credit outstanding thereunder).

Subject to the limits contained in the credit agreements that govern the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and
the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby, we may be able to incur substantial additional debt from
time to time to finance working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions, or for other purposes. If
we do so, the risks related to our high level of debt could increase. Specifically, our high level of debt could have
important consequences to the holders of the notes, including the following:

    - it may be difficult for us to satisfy our obligations, including debt service requirements under our
outstanding debt, including the notes;

    - our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service
requirements, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes may be impaired;

    - requiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal
and interest on our indebtedness, including the notes, therefore reducing our ability to use our cash
flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures, future business opportunities and other purposes;

    - we are more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse industry conditions and our flexibility to
plan for, or react to, changes in our business or industry is more limited;

    - our ability to capitalize on business opportunities and to react to competitive pressures, as compared to
our competitors, may be compromised due to our high level of debt and the restrictive covenants in the
credit agreements that govern the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the indenture that governs the
Existing Notes, and the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby;

    - our ability to borrow additional funds or to refinance debt may be limited; and


-----

    - it may cause potential or existing customers or vendors to not contract with us due to concerns over our
ability to meet our financial obligations.

If the Issuers or the guarantors incur any additional secured indebtedness that ranks equally with the notes
and guarantees, the holders of that debt will be entitled to share ratably with such holders in any proceeds distributed
in connection with any insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding up of the Issuers or a
guarantor, subject to any collateral arrangements. See “Description of Certain Other Indebtedness” and “Description
of Notes.” As described under the heading “Use of Proceeds,” we intend to use the net proceeds of this offering of
notes and borrowings under the New Term Loan B Facility, together with cash on hand, to repurchase the Seller
Notes issued by the Seller Notes Issuer to Emerson and/or for general corporate purposes and to pay fees, costs and
expenses related to this offering, and the proceeds from the offering will therefore not be available to service our
outstanding indebtedness, including the notes offered hereby.

**_Despite our indebtedness levels on the closing date after giving effect to this offering, we and our subsidiaries_**
**_may still be able to incur substantially more debt, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our_**
**_substantial leverage._**

We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Although the
credit agreements that govern the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the indenture that governs the Existing Notes and
the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby contain or will contain restrictions on the incurrence of
additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and the
indebtedness that may be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. If we incur additional
debt above the levels that will be in effect after giving effect to this offering, the risks associated with our leverage,
including those described above, would increase. In addition, as of March 31, 2024, we would have had
approximately $399.5 million of availability to incur additional secured indebtedness under the Revolving Credit
Facility, subject to borrowing base capacity (after giving effect to approximately $9.1 million of letters of credit
issued thereunder). Further, the restrictions in the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby, the indenture
that governs the Existing Notes and the credit agreements that govern the Senior Secured Credit Facilities do not or
will not prevent us from incurring obligations, such as trade payables, that do not constitute indebtedness as defined
in such debt instruments.

**_Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our indebtedness service_**
**_obligations to increase significantly and could adversely impact our ability to refinance our indebtedness._**

Interest rates may increase in the future. As a result, interest rates on the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, or
other variable rate debt offerings could be higher or lower than current levels. As of March 31, 2024, we had
$1,965.5 million of outstanding debt at variable interest rates. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations
on our variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net
income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, would correspondingly decrease. A
0.25% increase in the rate of interest under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities would increase our annual interest
expense by approximately $4.9 million based on amounts outstanding as of March 31, 2024, which amount would
increase to the extent additional borrowings are made on our Revolving Credit Facility. Additionally, an unfavorable
movement in interest rates, primarily the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”), could result in higher
interest rate expense and cash payments for us. Although we may enter into interest rate swaps, involving the
exchange of floating for fixed-rate interest payments, to reduce interest rate volatility, we cannot provide assurance
that we will enter into such arrangements or that they will successfully mitigate such interest rate volatility.

**_We may be unable to service our indebtedness, including the notes._**

Our ability to make scheduled payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, including the notes, depends
on and is subject to our financial and operating performance, which in turn is affected by general and regional
economic, financial, competitive, business and other factors, all of which are beyond our control, including the
availability of financing in the international banking and capital markets. Lower net sales generally will reduce our
cash flow. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future
borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our debt, including the notes, to

refinance our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs. Substantially all of our other debt, including the Senior
Secured Credit Facilities and the Existing Notes, will mature before the maturity dates of the notes.

If we are unable to meet our debt service obligations or to fund our other liquidity needs, we will need to
restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the notes, which could cause us to default on our debt
obligations and impair our liquidity. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of
the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our indebtedness could be at higher
interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants that could further restrict our business
operations.

Moreover, in the event of a default, the holders of our indebtedness, including the notes, could elect to
declare all the funds borrowed to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any. The lenders
under the Revolving Credit Facility could also elect to terminate their commitments thereunder, cease making
further loans and institute foreclosure proceedings against their collateral, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or
liquidation. If we breach our covenants under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or any of the Existing Notes, we
would be in default thereunder. The lenders or noteholders could exercise their rights, as described above, and we
could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.

**_The credit agreements that govern the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the indenture that governs the Existing_**
**_Notes and the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby each impose or will impose significant_**
**_operating and financial restrictions on the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries, which may prevent us from_**
**_capitalizing on business opportunities._**

The credit agreements that govern the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the indenture that governs the
Existing Notes, and the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby each impose or will impose significant
operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions limit or will limit the Issuer’s ability and the ability of
its restricted subsidiaries to, among other things:

    - incur or guarantee additional debt or issue disqualified stock or preferred stock;

    - pay dividends and make other distributions on, or redeem or repurchase, capital stock;

    - make certain investments;

    - incur certain liens;

    - enter into transactions with affiliates;

    - merge or consolidate;

    - enter into agreements that restrict the ability of restricted subsidiaries to make dividends or other
payments to the Issuers or the guarantors;

    - designate restricted subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries;

    - prepay, redeem or repurchase certain indebtedness that is subordinated in right of payment to the notes;
and

    - transfer or sell assets.

These covenants are subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions. The Issuer and its
restricted subsidiaries are subject to covenants, representations and warranties in respect of the Senior Secured
Credit Facilities, including, in the case of the Revolving Credit Facility, a fixed ratio covenant, and in the case of the
Term Loan A Facility, if applicable, a first lien net leverage ratio financial covenant, in the credit agreements that
govern the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. See “Description of Certain Other Indebtedness.”


-----

As a result of these restrictions, we will be limited as to how we conduct our business and we may be
unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business
opportunities. The terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants. We
cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and, if we fail to do
so, that we will be able to obtain waivers from the lenders and/or amend the covenants.

Our failure to comply with the restrictive covenants described above as well as other terms of our
indebtedness incurred and/or the terms of any future indebtedness from time to time could result in an event of
default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in our being required to repay these borrowings before their due
date. If we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms or cannot refinance these borrowings,
our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.

**_A decline in our operating results or available cash could cause us to experience difficulties in complying with_**
**_covenants contained in more than one agreement, which could result in our bankruptcy or liquidation._**

If we were to sustain a decline in our operating results or available cash, we could experience difficulties in
complying with the financial covenants contained in the credit agreements that govern the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities. The failure to comply with such covenants could result in an event of default under the Term Loan
Facilities and/or the Revolving Credit Facility and by reason of cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions, other
indebtedness may then become immediately due and payable. In addition, should an event of default occur, the
lenders under our Revolving Credit Facility could elect to terminate their commitments thereunder, cease making
loans and institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.
If our operating performance declines, we may in the future need to obtain waivers from the required lenders under
our Senior Secured Credit Facilities to avoid being in default. If we breach our covenants under our Senior Secured
Credit Facilities and seek a waiver, we may not be able to obtain a waiver from the required lenders. If this occurs,
we would be in default under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the lenders could exercise their rights, as
described above, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.

**_Repayment of our debt, including required principal and interest payments on the notes, is dependent on cash_**
**_flow generated by our subsidiaries, which may be subject to limitations beyond our control._**

Our subsidiaries own a substantial portion of our assets and conduct all of our operations. Accordingly,
repayment of our indebtedness, including the notes, is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries
and (if they are not guarantors of the notes) their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt
repayment or otherwise.

Unless they are guarantors of the notes, the Issuer’s subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts
due on the notes or to make funds available to the Issuers or the guarantors for that purpose. Our non-guarantor
subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in
respect of our indebtedness, including the notes. Each non-guarantor subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and, under
certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our non-guarantor
subsidiaries.

In the event that we are unable to receive distributions from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make
required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, including the notes.

**_Our failure to comply with the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness, including as a result of_**
**_events beyond our control, could result in an event of default that could materially and adversely affect our_**
**_results of operations and our financial condition._**

If there were an event of default under any of the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness, the
holders of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable
immediately. We cannot assure you that our assets or cash flows would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under
our outstanding debt instruments if accelerated upon an event of default. Further, if we are unable to repay, refinance
or restructure our indebtedness under our secured debt, including the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the holders of


-----

such debt could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness. In addition, any event of default or
declaration of acceleration under one debt instrument could also result in an event of default under one or more of
our other debt instruments.

**_Prior to or when the Senior Secured Credit Facilities mature, we may not be able to refinance or replace them._**

The Senior Secured Credit Facilities all have an earlier maturity date than the notes and the Existing Notes.
Prior to or when each of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities matures, we may need to refinance them and may not
be able to do so on favorable terms or at all. If we are able to refinance maturing indebtedness, the terms of any
refinancing or alternate credit arrangements may contain terms and covenants that restrict our financial and
operating flexibility. If we are unable to refinance the Senior Secured Credit Facilities prior to or when each
matures, it could result in an event of default under the agreements that govern the Senior Secured Credit Facilities.
Moreover, the occurrence of an event of default under the credit agreements that govern the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities could result in an event of default under our other indebtedness, including the indenture that governs the
Existing Notes and the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby.

**_Claims of holders of the notes will be structurally subordinated to claims of creditors of certain of our_**
**_subsidiaries that will not guarantee the notes._**

The notes will not be guaranteed by certain of our existing and future subsidiaries. Only Holdings and our
existing wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries that guarantee indebtedness under the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities will initially guarantee the notes. As of the closing date of the Acquisition, none of our foreign subsidiaries
will guarantee the notes, and no such subsidiaries are expected to guarantee the notes in the future. Claims of holders
of the notes will be structurally subordinated to the claims of creditors of these non-guarantor subsidiaries and trade
creditors, and will not be satisfied from the assets of these non-guarantor subsidiaries until their creditors are paid in
full. As of and for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, our non-guarantor subsidiaries represented
approximately 40% of our net sales, 57% of our EBITDA, 45% of our total assets and 21% of our total liabilities.

In addition, the guarantee of certain guarantors will be released in connection with a transfer of such
guarantor in a transaction not prohibited by the indenture that governs the Existing Notes or the indenture that will
govern the notes offered hereby or upon certain other events described in “Description of Notes—Guarantees.”

The indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby will permit these non-guarantor subsidiaries to
incur certain additional debt and will not limit their ability to incur other liabilities that are not considered
indebtedness thereunder.

**_Certain actions in respect of defaults and amendments taken under the indenture governing the notes by_**
**_beneficial owners, including those with short positions in excess of their interests in the notes, will be_**
**_disregarded._**

By acceptance of the notes, each holder of notes (other than screened affiliates and regulated banks) agrees,
in connection with any notice of default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee or the Notes Collateral
Agent to provide a notice of default, notice of acceleration or take any other action (a “Noteholder Direction”), to
(i) deliver a written representation to the Issuers, the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent that such holder and
any of its affiliates acting in concert with it in connection with its investment in the notes (other than screened
affiliates and regulated banks) are not (or, in the case such holder is a depositary or its nominee, that such holder is
being instructed solely by beneficial owners that (together with such affiliates) are not) Net Short (as defined under
the heading “Description of Notes”) with respect to the notes and (ii) provide the Issuers with such other information
as the Issuers may reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such holder’s
representation within five business days of request therefor. These restrictions may impact a holder’s ability to
participate in Noteholder Directions if it is unable to make such a representation.

In addition, for purposes of determining whether the required number of holders have (i) consented (or not
consented) to any amendment, modification, waiver, consent or other action with respect to any of the terms of the
indenture that governs the notes, (ii) otherwise acted on any matter related to the indenture that governs the notes or


-----

(iii) directed or required the Trustee, the Notes Collateral Agent, or any holder to undertake any action with respect
to or under the indenture that governs the notes, all notes held or beneficially owned by a holder or a beneficial
owner (together with its affiliates) may not account for more than 20.0% of the notes included in determining
whether the required number of holders have consented to any action (the “Voting Cap”). All notes held by any
holder or beneficial owner or any affiliate of such holder or beneficial owner in excess of the Voting Cap shall be
deemed to not be outstanding for all purposes of calculating whether the required number of holders have taken any
action (or refrained from taking any action) or provided any consent or waiver with respect to the notes, subject to
certain exceptions. These restrictions may impact a holder’s or beneficial owner’s ability to participate in a voting
decision if such holder or beneficial owner and its affiliates own a large amount of notes.

**_Many of the covenants in the indenture that will govern the notes will not apply to us if the notes are rated_**
**_investment grade by either Moody’s or S&P._**

Many of the covenants in the indenture that will govern the notes will cease to apply to the notes during
such time, if any, as the notes are rated investment grade by either Moody’s or S&P, provided that at such time no
default or event of default has occurred and is continuing. Although there can be no assurance that the notes will
ever be rated investment grade, or if they are rated investment grade, that the notes will maintain these ratings, any
suspension of the covenants under the indenture that will govern the notes would allow us to engage in certain
transactions that would not be permitted while these covenants were in effect. To the extent any suspended
covenants are subsequently reinstated, any actions taken by us while the covenants were suspended would not result
in an event of default under the indenture that will govern the notes on the basis that such actions would have been
prohibited by the covenants. See “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants.”

**_Sales of assets by the Issuers and the guarantors could reduce the Collateral and the guarantees._**

The security documents that will relate to the notes offered hereby will allow the Issuers and the guarantors
to remain in possession of, retain exclusive control over, freely operate and collect, invest and dispose of any income
from, the Collateral. To the extent the Issuers or a guarantor sells any assets that constitute such Collateral, the
proceeds from such sale will be subject to the liens securing the notes offered hereby and the guarantees only to the
extent such proceeds would otherwise constitute Collateral securing the notes offered hereby and the guarantees
under the security documents. Such proceeds will also be subject to the security interests of certain creditors other
than the holders of the notes offered hereby, some of which may be senior or prior to the liens held by the holders of
the notes, or may have a lien in those assets that is equal in priority with the lien of the holders of the notes
(including, without limitation, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities). To the extent the proceeds from any sale of
Collateral do not constitute Collateral under the security documents, the pool of assets securing the notes and the
guarantees will be reduced, and the notes and the guarantees will not be secured by such proceeds.

**_The value of the Collateral securing the notes offered hereby and the guarantees may not be sufficient to satisfy_**
**_our obligations under the notes._**

The notes and the guarantees will be secured by the Collateral. The notes and the guarantees will be
secured on an equal priority basis with the Existing Notes and our Term Loan Facilities by the assets that secure our
Term Loan Facilities, which consist of a senior-priority lien on the Fixed Asset Priority Collateral (as defined in the
“Description of the Notes”), and consist of a junior-priority lien on the ABL Priority Collateral (as defined in the
“Description of the Notes”), in each case, subject to certain limitations and exceptions and permitted liens. The lien
securing the notes on the Fixed Asset Priority Collateral will be senior to the lien on such Collateral securing our
Revolving Credit Facility and the lien securing the notes on the ABL Priority Collateral will be junior to the lien on
such Collateral securing our Revolving Credit Facility.

Upon consummation of the Seller Notes Repurchase, obligations under the notes and the guarantees will be
secured on an equal priority basis with the Existing Notes and our Term Loan Facilities by the assets that secure the
Existing Notes and our Term Loan Facilities, which will consist of a senior-priority lien on the Fixed Asset Priority
Collateral, and will consist of a junior-priority lien on the ABL Priority Collateral, in each case, subject to certain
limitations and exceptions and permitted liens (subject to other prior ranking liens permitted by the indenture that
will govern the notes). Accordingly, any proceeds received upon a realization of the Fixed Asset Priority Collateral
securing the notes, the Existing Notes and our Term Loan Facilities will be applied to the costs and expenses


-----

incurred in connection with such realization and, ratably, to obligations (including expenses and other amounts)
under the notes, the Existing Notes and our Term Loan Facilities and other future equal priority lien indebtedness,
and any proceeds received upon a realization of the ABL Priority Collateral will be applied to the costs and expenses
incurred in connection with such realization and to obligations (including expenses and other amounts) under our
Revolving Credit Facility and all other future senior-priority indebtedness that is secured by the ABL Priority
Collateral prior to being applied ratably to the notes and our Term Loan Facilities.

No appraisal of the value of the Collateral has been made in connection with this offering of the notes, and
the fair market value of the Collateral will be subject to fluctuations based on factors that include, among others,
changing economic conditions, competition and other future trends. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral may
be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. In the event of a foreclosure, liquidation, bankruptcy
or similar proceeding, the Collateral may not be sold in a timely or orderly manner, and the proceeds from any sale
or liquidation of the Collateral may not be sufficient to pay our obligations under the notes, in full or at all,
particularly with the proceeds from the ABL Priority Collateral, which will be applied first to satisfying in full our
obligations under our Revolving Credit Facility and all other future senior-priority indebtedness that is secured by
the ABL Priority Collateral.

Moreover, the lenders under the Term Loan Facilities and the holders of any other additional indebtedness
secured by a senior-priority lien on the Fixed Asset Priority Collateral will share the proceeds of such Fixed Asset
Priority Collateral ratably with the holders of the notes and the Existing Notes, thereby diluting the Fixed Asset
Priority Collateral coverage available to holders of the notes. In particular, the fair market value of the Collateral
may not be sufficient to repay the holders of the notes upon any foreclosure, liquidation, bankruptcy or similar
proceeding and after the repayment of indebtedness with prior security interests in the Collateral, if any. There also
can be no assurance that the Collateral will be saleable, and even if saleable, the timing of its liquidation would be
uncertain. Accordingly, there may not be sufficient Collateral to pay all or any of the amounts due on the notes. Any
claim for the difference between the amount, if any, realized by holders of the notes from the sale of the Collateral
securing the notes and the obligations under the notes and other obligations secured by a lien on Collateral will rank
equally in right of payment with all of the Issuers’ unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness and other obligations,
including trade payables. In addition, as discussed further below, the holders of the notes would not be entitled to
receive post-petition interest or applicable fees, costs, expenses, or charges to the extent the amount of the
obligations due under the notes exceed the value of the Collateral (after taking into account all other equal priority
debt that was also secured by the Collateral, including the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Existing Notes),
or any “adequate protection” on account of any undersecured portion of the notes. See “—In the event of a
bankruptcy of the Issuers or any of the guarantors, the holders of the notes may be deemed to have an unsecured
claim to the extent that the Issuers’ obligations in respect of the notes exceed the fair market value of the Collateral
securing the notes and the guarantees.”

With respect to some of the Collateral, the security interest of the Notes Collateral Agent and its ability to
foreclose will also be limited by the need to meet certain requirements, such as obtaining third-party consents and
making additional filings. If the Issuers are unable to obtain these consents or make these filings, the security
interests may be invalid and the holders will not be entitled to the Collateral or any recovery with respect thereto.
We cannot assure you that any such required consents will be obtained on a timely basis or at all. These
requirements may limit the number of potential bidders for certain Collateral in any foreclosure or other auction and
may delay any sale, either of which events may have an adverse effect on the sale price of the Collateral. Therefore,
the practical value of realizing on the Collateral may, without the appropriate consents and filings, be limited.

Under the terms of the indenture that will govern the notes, the Issuers will be permitted to incur
indebtedness in amounts in excess of the principal amount of outstanding Existing Notes and the commitments
under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. The Existing Notes and all of the commitments under the Term Loan
Facilities are secured by a lien on the Fixed Asset Priority Collateral that will rank equally with the notes, and the
commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility are secured by a lien on the ABL Priority Collateral that will rank
senior to the notes. The indenture that will govern the notes will also permit the Issuers and the guarantors to create
additional liens on the Collateral under specified circumstances, some of which liens may be equal in priority with
or senior to the liens securing the notes. Any obligations secured by such liens may further dilute the collateral
coverage and limit the recovery from the realization of the collateral available to satisfy holders of the notes. See
“Description of Notes—Certain Covenants—Liens.”

**_The rights of holders of the notes may be adversely affected by the Intercreditor Agreements._**

The Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement sets forth the relative rights of, and relationship among, the
Notes Collateral Agent, the Existing Notes Collateral Agent, the holders of the notes, the holders of the Existing
Notes, the Bank Collateral Agent and the lenders under each of our Term Loan Facilities and the applicable
representative of the holders and the lenders under any other future equal priority lien indebtedness in respect of the
exercise of rights and remedies against the Issuers and the guarantors. The ABL Intercreditor Agreement sets forth
the relative priorities of the liens on the Collateral securing the notes, the Existing Notes and our Term Loan
Facilities and other future equal priority lien indebtedness, on the one hand, and our Revolving Credit Facility, on
the other hand, and the relative rights of, and relationship among, the Notes Collateral Agent, the Existing Notes
Collateral Agent, the holders of the notes, the holders of the Existing Notes, the Bank Collateral Agent and the
lenders under each of our Term Loan Facilities, the applicable representative of the holders and the holders under
any other future equal priority lien indebtedness, on the one hand, and the ABL Collateral Agent and the lenders
under our Revolving Credit Facility, on the other hand, to enforce such liens. Under the terms of the ABL
Intercreditor Agreement, the liens on the ABL Priority Collateral securing the obligations under our Revolving
Credit Facility, together with any other obligations permitted to be secured by the ABL Priority Collateral on a
senior-priority basis, rank senior to the liens on such ABL Priority Collateral securing the Issuers’ and the
guarantors’ obligations under our Term Loan Facilities, the notes and the guarantees and the liens on the Fixed Asset
Priority Collateral securing the Issuers’ and the guarantors’ obligations under our Term Loan Facilities, the notes
and the guarantees rank senior to the liens on such Fixed Asset Priority Collateral securing the obligations under our
Revolving Credit Facility.

The rights of the holders of the notes with respect to the Collateral will be subject to the Equal Priority
Intercreditor Agreement among all holders of obligations secured by the Collateral on an equal priority basis,
including the obligations under the Term Loan Facilities and the Existing Notes. Under the Equal Priority
Intercreditor Agreement, any actions that may be taken with respect to the Collateral, including the ability to cause
the commencement of enforcement proceedings against the Collateral and to control such proceedings, will be at the
exclusive direction of the Bank Collateral Agent until the earlier of (1) the date on which the Issuers’ obligations
under the Term Loan B Facilities is discharged (which discharge does not include certain refinancings of the senior
secured credit facilities) or (2) 120 days after the occurrence of an event of default under the indenture that will
govern the notes and acceleration of the obligations thereunder, if the notes represent the largest outstanding
principal amount of indebtedness secured by an equal priority lien on the Collateral (other than the Existing Notes
and the Term Loan Facilities) and the Notes Collateral Agent has complied with the applicable notice provisions so
long as the applicable agent under the Term Loan Facilities has not commenced and is not then diligently pursuing
the exercise of remedies with respect to Collateral or any portion thereof or the Issuers or any guarantor is not then a
debtor in any bankruptcy or similar insolvency or liquidation proceeding.

Under the terms of the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement, if at any time the controlling collateral agent
forecloses upon or otherwise exercises remedies against any Collateral resulting in a sale thereof, the lien securing
the notes on such Collateral will be automatically released and discharged (provided that any proceeds from such
sale are applied ratably among all the then outstanding equal priority obligations). The Collateral so released will no
longer secure the Issuers’ and the guarantors’ obligations under the notes and the guarantees. The holders of the
notes will also waive certain important rights otherwise available to secured creditors in a bankruptcy, as the Equal
Priority Intercreditor Agreement will prohibit the trustee for the notes and the Notes Collateral Agent from objecting
following the filing of a bankruptcy petition to a proposed debtor-in-possession financing to be provided to us that is
secured by the Collateral or to the use of cash collateral that has not been opposed to or objected to by the
controlling collateral agent or the other controlling secured parties, subject to certain conditions and limited
exceptions. After such a filing, the value of the Collateral could materially deteriorate, and holders of the notes
would be unable to raise an objection.

The rights of the holders of the notes with respect to the Collateral will be subject to the ABL Intercreditor
Agreement among all holders of obligations secured by the Collateral, including the obligations under the Revolving
Credit Facility. Under the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, any actions that may be taken with respect to the ABL
Priority Collateral, including the ability to cause the commencement of enforcement proceedings against such ABL
Priority Collateral and to control such proceedings, will be at the exclusive direction of the collateral agent under the
Revolving Credit Facility until the date on which the Issuers’ obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility are


-----

discharged (which discharge does not include certain refinancings of the Revolving Credit Facility) and, any actions
that may be taken with respect to the Fixed Asset Priority Collateral, including the ability to cause the
commencement of enforcement proceedings against such Fixed Asset Priority Collateral and to control such
proceedings, will be at the exclusive direction of the controlling collateral agent under the Equal Priority
Intercreditor Agreement.

Under the terms of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, if at any time the collateral agent under the
Revolving Credit Facility forecloses upon or otherwise exercises remedies against any ABL Priority Collateral
resulting in a sale thereof, the lien securing the notes on such ABL Priority Collateral will be automatically released
and discharged (provided that any proceeds from such sale following application of such proceeds to the repayment
of obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility are applied ratably among all the then outstanding Senior ABL
Revolving Credit Obligations (as defined in the “Description of the Notes”)). The ABL Priority Collateral so
released will no longer secure the Issuers’ and the guarantors’ obligations under the notes and the guarantees. The
holders of the notes will also waive certain important rights otherwise available to secured creditors in a bankruptcy,
as the ABL Intercreditor Agreement prohibits the trustee for the notes and the Notes Collateral Agent from objecting
following the filing of a bankruptcy petition to a proposed debtor-in-possession financing to be provided to us that is
secured by the ABL Priority Collateral or to the use of cash collateral that has not been opposed to or objected to by
the controlling collateral agent or the other controlling secured parties, subject to certain conditions and limited
exceptions. After such a filing, the value of the ABL Priority Collateral could materially deteriorate, and holders of
the notes would be unable to raise an objection.

Pursuant to the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, the holders of the notes, the Notes Collateral Agent, the
Existing Notes Collateral Agent and the Bank Collateral Agent agree not to contest, protest or object to any
foreclosure proceedings or action brought by the lenders or the collateral agent under our Revolving Credit Facility
or the exercise of rights and remedies relating to any ABL Priority Collateral, and pursuant to the Equal Priority
Intercreditor Agreement, the holders of the notes, the Notes Collateral Agent and the Existing Notes Collateral
Agent will agree not to contest, protest or object to any foreclosure proceedings or action brought by the Bank
Collateral Agent relating to any Collateral, subject to certain limitations.

Under these circumstances, the Notes Collateral Agent on behalf of the holders of the notes, with limited
exceptions, will not have the ability to control or direct these actions, even if the rights of the holders of the notes are
adversely affected, and may not be able to act quickly, or at all, to have the Notes Collateral Agent realize on the
Collateral. See “Description of Notes—Security for the Notes—Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement” and
“Description of Notes— Security for the Notes—ABL/Fixed Asset Intercreditor Agreement.”

**_The obligations of the Issuers and the guarantors under our Revolving Credit Facility, which are secured by a_**
**_portion of the same assets that will secure the notes, together with any additional secured indebtedness permitted_**
**_to be secured by the ABL Priority Collateral on a senior-priority basis, will be senior to the notes to the extent of_**
**_the value of the ABL Priority Collateral securing such indebtedness on a senior-priority basis._**

The obligations of the Issuers and the guarantors under our Revolving Credit Facility are secured, subject to
certain limitations and exceptions and permitted liens, by a senior-priority security interest in the ABL Priority
Collateral. The notes and the guarantees thereof will be secured, subject to certain limitations and exceptions and
permitted liens, by a junior-priority lien on all of such ABL Priority Collateral. Subject to the terms of the ABL
Intercreditor Agreement, the liens on the ABL Priority Collateral held by the holders of the notes will, therefore, be
fully subordinated to the liens on the ABL Priority Collateral held by our creditors under our Revolving Credit
Facility, together with any additional secured indebtedness permitted to be secured by the ABL Priority Collateral
on a first-priority basis, to the extent of the value of the ABL Priority Collateral securing such indebtedness. Only
when our obligations under our Revolving Credit Facility, and all other permitted senior-priority indebtedness that is
secured by such ABL Priority Collateral, are satisfied in full will the proceeds of such ABL Priority Collateral be
available, subject to other permitted liens, to satisfy obligations under our Term Loan Facilities, the notes and the
guarantees and other equal priority lien indebtedness on an equal priority basis.


-----

**_Pledges of equity interests of certain of the Issuer’s foreign subsidiaries may not constitute Collateral for the_**
**_repayment of the notes because such pledges may not be perfected pursuant to foreign law pledge documents._**

Part of the security for the repayment of the notes may consist of a pledge of up to 65% of the voting stock
of each direct foreign subsidiary of the Issuer. Although such a pledge of capital stock will be required to be granted
under U.S. security documents, it may be necessary or desirable to perfect such pledges under foreign law pledge
documents. The Issuer will not be required to provide such foreign law pledge documents. Unless and until such
pledges of equity interests are properly perfected, they may not constitute Collateral for the repayment of the notes.

**_Certain laws and regulations may impose restrictions or limitations on foreclosure._**

The Issuers’ obligations under the notes and the guarantors’ obligations under the guarantees are secured
only by the Collateral described in this offering memorandum. The Notes Collateral Agent’s ability to foreclose on
the Collateral on behalf of the holders of the notes may be subject to perfection, priority issues, state law
requirements, applicable bankruptcy law, and practical problems associated with the realization of the Notes
Collateral Agent’s security interest in or lien on the Collateral, including cure rights, foreclosing on the Collateral
within the time periods permitted by third parties or prescribed by laws, obtaining third-party consents, making
additional filings, statutory rights of redemption and the effect of the order of foreclosure. We cannot assure you that
the consents of any third parties and approvals by governmental entities or courts of competent jurisdiction will be
given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Therefore, we cannot assure you that foreclosure on
the Collateral will be sufficient to make all payments on the notes.

**_Rights of holders of the notes in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to create or perfect the_**
**_security interests._**

The Collateral securing the notes and the guarantees will include substantially all of the Issuers’ and the
guarantors’ tangible and intangible assets which assets also secure the Issuers’ and the guarantors’ indebtedness
under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Existing Notes, whether now owned or acquired or arising in the
future. Applicable law requires that a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be properly
perfected and its priority retained through certain actions undertaken by the secured party. The liens on the
Collateral securing the notes may not be perfected if we are not able to take the actions necessary to perfect any of
these liens on or prior to the date of the issuance of the notes or thereafter. We will have limited obligations to
perfect the security interest of the holders of the notes in specified collateral other than the filing of financing
statements. To the extent a security interest in certain Collateral is not properly perfected on the date of the issuance
of the notes, such security interest might be avoidable in bankruptcy, which could impact the value of the Collateral.
See “—Any future pledge of Collateral or guarantee may be avoidable in bankruptcy.”

If additional material wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries are formed or acquired and become
guarantors under the indenture that will govern the notes, additional financing statements would be required to be
filed to perfect the security interest for the notes in the assets of such guarantors. Depending on the type of the assets
constituting after-acquired collateral, additional action may be required to perfect the security interest in such assets.
Applicable law requires that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest can be
perfected only at the time such property and rights are acquired and identified. Neither the trustee for the notes nor
the Notes Collateral Agent will be responsible to monitor, and there can be no assurance that the Issuers will inform
the trustee for the notes or the Notes Collateral Agent of, the future acquisition of property and rights that constitute
Collateral, and that the necessary action will be taken to properly perfect the security interest in such after-acquired
collateral. None of the trustee for the notes, the Notes Collateral Agent, the Existing Notes Collateral Agent or the
collateral agent for the Senior Secured Credit Facilities will have any obligation to monitor the acquisition of
additional property or rights that constitute Collateral or monitor the perfection of or make any filings to perfect or
maintain the perfection of any security interests therein. Such inaction may result in the loss of the security interest
in such Collateral or the priority of the security interest in favor of the notes and the guarantees against third parties.
Even if the Notes Collateral Agent’s liens on Collateral acquired or arising in the future are properly perfected, such
liens may potentially be avoidable as a preference in any bankruptcy proceeding under certain circumstances. See
“—Any future pledge of Collateral or guarantee may be avoidable in bankruptcy.”

**_Lien searches may not reveal all liens on the Collateral._**

We cannot guarantee that the lien searches on the Collateral that will secure the notes and guarantees
thereof will reveal any or all existing liens on such Collateral. Any such existing lien, including undiscovered liens,
could be significant, could be prior in ranking to the liens securing the notes and guarantees thereof and could have
an adverse effect on the ability of the Notes Collateral Agent to realize or foreclose upon the Collateral securing the
notes and guarantees thereof.

**_The Collateral is subject to casualty risks._**

We intend to maintain insurance or otherwise insure against hazards in a manner appropriate and customary
for our business. There are, however, certain losses that may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable, in
whole or in part. Insurance proceeds may not compensate us fully for our losses. If there is a complete or partial loss
or impairment in value of any of the Collateral, the insurance proceeds may not be sufficient to satisfy all of the
secured obligations, including the notes and the guarantees.

**_The imposition of certain permitted liens will, under certain circumstances, permit the liens on the related assets_**
**_securing the notes and the guarantees to be either subordinated to such permitted liens or released. There are_**
**_also certain other assets that are also excluded from the Collateral._**

The indenture that will govern the notes will permit liens in favor of third parties to secure additional debt,
including purchase money indebtedness and capital lease obligations, and, in the case of certain of such liens, the
liens on the related assets securing the notes and the guarantees may, under certain circumstances, be either
subordinated to such permitted liens or released. Our ability to incur additional debt and liens on such additional
debt in favor of third parties is subject to limitations as described herein under the headings “Description of Notes.”
In addition, certain assets are excluded from the Collateral securing the notes and the guarantees, as discussed under
“Description of Notes—Security for the Notes.” If an event of default occurs and the maturity of the notes is
accelerated, the notes and the guarantees will rank equal in priority with the holders of other unsecured or senior
indebtedness of the relevant obligor with respect to such excluded assets. As a result, if the value of the assets
pledged as security for the notes is less than the value of the claims of the holders of the notes, those claims may not
be satisfied in full before the claims of our unsecured creditors are paid.

**_Federal and state fraudulent transfer laws permit a court, under certain circumstances, to void the notes and the_**
**_guarantees, and the liens securing the notes and the guarantees, subordinate claims in respect of the notes, the_**
**_guarantees and the liens securing the notes and the guarantees and/or require holders of the notes to return_**
**_payments received from us in respect of the guarantees and the liens and, if that occurs, you may not receive any_**
**_payments on the notes._**

The issuance of the notes and the guarantees and, in the case of the notes and the guarantees, the grant of
liens by the Issuers and the guarantors (including any future guarantees and future liens) may be subject to review
under federal and state fraudulent transfer and conveyance statutes if a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization
case or a lawsuit, including under circumstances in which bankruptcy is not involved, were commenced at some
future date by the Issuers, by the guarantors or on behalf of our unpaid creditors or the unpaid creditors of a
guarantor. While the relevant laws may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, the incurrence of the obligations in
respect of the notes and the guarantees and, in the case of the notes and the guarantees, the grant of liens will
generally be a fraudulent conveyance if (i) the transactions relating to the issuance of the notes or guarantees or, in
the case of the notes and the guarantees, the grant of liens were undertaken with the intent of hindering, delaying or
defrauding other creditors or (ii) the Issuers or any of the guarantors, as applicable, received less than reasonably
equivalent value or fair consideration in return for issuing either the notes or a guarantee or, in the case of the notes
and the guarantees, the granting of liens and, in the case of (ii) only, any one of the following is also true:

    - the Issuers or any of the guarantors was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of issuing the notes
or the guarantees (or the related security interests with respect to the notes and the guarantees);


-----

    - the issuance of the notes or guarantees (or the related security interests with respect to the notes and the
guarantees) left the Issuers or any of the guarantors with an unreasonably small amount of capital to
carry on the business in which such Issuers or such guarantor was engaged or about to engage; or

    - the Issuers or any of the guarantors intended to, or believed that we or it would, incur debts beyond our
or its ability to pay as they become due.

If a court were to find that the issuance of the notes or a guarantee or, in the case of the notes and the
guarantees, the grant of liens was a fraudulent conveyance, the court could void the payment obligations under the
notes or such guarantee or further subordinate the notes or such guarantee to presently existing and future
indebtedness of such Issuer or such guarantor, or require the holders of the notes to repay any amounts received with
respect to the notes or such guarantee or, in the case of the notes and the guarantees, void the granting of liens to
secure the notes or the guarantees. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent conveyance occurred, you may not
receive any repayment on the notes. Further, the voidance of the notes could result in an event of default with
respect to our other debt and that of the guarantors that could result in acceleration of such debt.

The measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent conveyance laws vary depending upon the law of
the jurisdiction that is being applied, such that we cannot be certain as to: the standards a court would use to
determine whether or not the Issuers or the guarantors were solvent at the relevant time, or, regardless of the
standard that a court uses, that it would not determine that the Issuers or a guarantor was indeed insolvent on that
date; that any payments to the holders of the notes (including under the guarantees) did not constitute preferences,
fraudulent transfers or conveyances on other grounds; or that the issuance of the notes and the guarantees would not
be subordinated to the Issuers’ or any guarantor’s other debt.

Generally, an entity would be considered insolvent if, at the time it incurred indebtedness:

    - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair value of all its assets;

    - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its
probable liability on its existing debts and liabilities, including contingent liabilities, as they become
absolute and mature; or

    - it could not pay its debts as they become due.

As a general matter, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or
obligation, property is transferred or a valid antecedent debt is satisfied. A court would likely find that the Issuers or
a guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the notes or such guarantee and/or
lien if the Issuers or such guarantor did not substantially benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the notes
or the applicable guarantee and/or lien. Thus, if the guarantees were legally challenged, any guarantee could be
subject to the claim that, since the guarantee was incurred for the Issuers’ benefit, and only indirectly for the benefit
of the guarantor, the obligations of the applicable guarantor were incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value
or fair consideration. Therefore, a court could void the obligations under the guarantees (and any related liens in the
case of the notes), subordinate them to the applicable guarantor’s other debt or take other action detrimental to the
holders of the notes.

To the extent a court avoids any of the guarantees as fraudulent transfers or holds any of the guarantees
unenforceable for any other reason, (x) the holders of notes would cease to have any direct claim against the
applicable guarantor or (y) in the case of liens granted to secure the notes or the guarantees, the holders of notes
would cease to have a secured claim against the Issuers or the guarantors, as applicable. If a court were to take this
action, the applicable guarantor’s assets would be applied first to satisfy the applicable guarantor’s other liabilities,
if any, and might not be applied to the payment of the guarantee. Sufficient funds to repay the notes may not be
available from other sources, including the remaining guarantors, if any. In addition, the court might direct you to
repay any amounts that you already received from the Issuers or the applicable guarantor.


-----

Although each guarantee entered into in connection with the notes will contain a provision intended to limit
that guarantor’s liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations
under its guarantee to be a fraudulent transfer, this provision may not be effective as a legal matter to protect those
guarantees from being avoided under fraudulent transfer law or otherwise, or may reduce that guarantor’s obligation
to an amount that effectively makes its guarantee worthless.

In addition, as noted above, any payment by the Issuers pursuant to the notes or by a guarantor under a
guarantee made at a time such Issuers or such guarantor was found to be insolvent could be voided and required to
be returned to the Issuers or such guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the Issuers’ or such guarantor’s creditors if
such payment is made to an insider within a one-year period prior to a bankruptcy filing or within 90 days for any
outside party and such payment would give such insider or outsider party more than such creditors would have
received in a distribution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in a hypothetical Chapter 7 case.

Finally, as a court of equity, the bankruptcy court may otherwise subordinate the claims in respect of the
notes or the guarantees to other claims against the Issuers or the guarantors under the principle of equitable
subordination, if the court determines that: (i) the holder of the notes engaged in some type of inequitable conduct;
(ii) such inequitable conduct resulted in injury to our other creditors or conferred an unfair advantage upon the
holder of the notes; and (iii) equitable subordination is not inconsistent with the provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy
Code.

**_Any future pledge of Collateral or guarantee may be avoidable in bankruptcy._**

Collateral pledged or guarantees issued after the issue date of the notes may be treated under bankruptcy
law as if they were pledged to secure or delivered to guarantee, as applicable, previously existing indebtedness. Any
future pledge of Collateral or issuance of a guarantee in favor of the holders of the notes (including any Liens
delivered or reinstated after the Reversion Date (as defined under the heading “Description of Notes”), and/or
pursuant to guarantees delivered in connection therewith after the date the notes are issued) may be avoidable by the
pledgor (as a debtor in possession), guarantor (as a debtor in possession), by its trustee in bankruptcy or potentially
by other creditors if certain events or circumstances exist or occur, including, among others, if (1) the pledgor or
guarantor is insolvent at the time of the pledge and/or issuance of the guarantee, (2) the pledge and/or issuance of the
guarantee (as applicable) permits the holders of the notes to receive a greater recovery in a hypothetical Chapter 7
case than if such pledge and/or guarantee (as applicable) had not been given and (3) a bankruptcy proceeding in
respect of the pledgor or guarantor is commenced within 90 days following the pledge or the perfection thereof
and/or the issuance of the guarantee (as applicable), or, in certain circumstances, a longer period. Accordingly, if the
Issuers or any guarantor were to file for bankruptcy protection after the issue date of the notes and any pledge of
Collateral not pledged, or any guarantees not issued on the issue date of the notes had been pledged or perfected or
issued (as applicable) less than 90 days before commencement of such bankruptcy proceeding, such pledges or
guarantees are materially more likely to be avoided as a preference by the bankruptcy court than if delivered on the
issue date of the notes (even if the other guarantees or liens (as applicable) issued on the issue date of the notes
would no longer be subject to such risk). To the extent that the grant of any such security interest and/or guarantee is
avoided as a preference or otherwise, you would lose the benefit of the security interest and/or guarantee (as
applicable).

**_Rights of holders of the notes in the Collateral may be adversely affected by bankruptcy proceedings._**

The right of the Notes Collateral Agent to foreclose upon, repossess and dispose of the Collateral securing
the notes and the guarantees is likely to be significantly impaired (or at a minimum delayed) by federal bankruptcy
law if bankruptcy proceedings are commenced by or against the Issuers or the guarantors that provide security for
the notes or the guarantees prior to, or possibly even after, any collateral agent has repossessed and disposed of the
Collateral. Under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, a secured creditor, such as the Notes Collateral Agent, is prohibited
from foreclosing upon or repossessing its security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from disposing of security
previously repossessed from a debtor, without prior bankruptcy court approval (which may not be given under the
circumstances). Moreover, bankruptcy law permits the debtor to continue to retain and use collateral, and the
proceeds, products, rents or profits of the collateral, even though the debtor is in default under the applicable debt
instruments, provided that the secured creditor is given “adequate protection.” The meaning of the term “adequate
protection” may vary according to the circumstances, but it is intended in general to protect the value of the secured


-----

creditor’s interest in its collateral and may include cash payments or the granting of additional or replacement
security, if and at such time as the court in its discretion determines, for any diminution in the value of the collateral
as a result of the automatic stay of repossession or disposition or any use of the collateral by the debtor during the
pendency of the bankruptcy case. A bankruptcy court may determine that a secured creditor may not require
compensation for a diminution in the value of its collateral if the value of the collateral exceeds the debt it secures.
In view of both the lack of a precise definition of the term “adequate protection” under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code
and the broad discretionary powers of a bankruptcy court, it is impossible to predict how, whether or when payments
under the notes could be made following the commencement of a bankruptcy case, the length of the delay in making
any such payments or whether any such payment will be made at all or in what form, whether or when the Notes
Collateral Agent could or would repossess or dispose of the Collateral, the value of the Collateral as of the
commencement date of any bankruptcy proceedings, or whether or to what extent or in what form holders of the
notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of the value of the Collateral through the requirements
of “adequate protection.”

**_Furthermore, any disposition of the Collateral during a bankruptcy case outside of the ordinary course of_**
**_business would also require approval from the bankruptcy court (which may not be given under the_**
**_circumstances)._**

Also, in the event the bankruptcy court determines that the value of the Collateral is not sufficient to repay
all amounts due on the notes and all of our other outstanding Equal Priority Obligations (as defined under the
heading “Description of Notes”), the holders of the notes would be “undersecured.” U.S. bankruptcy laws do not
provide for the payment or accrual of interest, expenses, costs and attorneys’ fees on the “undersecured” portion of a
creditor claims during a debtor’s bankruptcy case nor is a creditor entitled to adequate protection on account of any
undersecured portion of its claims.

In addition, as noted above, the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement and the ABL Intercreditor
Agreement, as applicable, will prohibit the trustee for the notes and the Notes Collateral Agent from objecting
following the filing of a bankruptcy petition to proposed debtor-in-possession financing to be provided to us that is
secured by the Fixed Asset Priority Collateral or by the ABL Priority Collateral, as applicable, or to the use of cash
collateral that has not been opposed to or objected to by the controlling collateral agent or the other controlling
secured parties, subject to certain conditions and limited exceptions. After such a filing, the value of the Fixed Asset
Priority Collateral and the ABL Priority Collateral could materially deteriorate, and holders of the notes would be
unable to raise an objection.

**_In the event of a bankruptcy of the Issuers or any of the guarantors, the holders of the notes may be deemed to_**
**_have an unsecured claim to the extent that the Issuers’ obligations in respect of the notes exceed the fair market_**
**_value of the Collateral securing the notes and the guarantees._**

In any bankruptcy proceeding with respect to the Issuers or any of the guarantors that have guaranteed the
notes, it is possible that the bankruptcy trustee, the debtor-in-possession or competing creditors will assert that the
fair market value of the Collateral with respect to the notes on the date of the bankruptcy filing was less than the
then-current principal amount of the notes and all of our other outstanding Equal Priority Obligations. Upon a
finding by the bankruptcy court that the notes are under-collateralized, the claims in the bankruptcy proceeding with
respect to the notes would be bifurcated between a secured claim and an unsecured claim, and the unsecured claim
would not be entitled to the benefits of security in the Collateral. In such event, the secured claims of the holders of
the notes would be limited to the value of the Collateral.

The consequences of a finding of under-collateralization would include, among other things, a lack of
entitlement on the part of the holders of the notes to receive post-petition interest, fees, and expenses and a lack of
entitlement on the part of the unsecured portion of the notes to receive “adequate protection” under federal
bankruptcy laws, as discussed above. In addition, if any payments of post-petition interest had been made at the time
of such a finding of under-collateralization, those payments could be re-characterized by the bankruptcy court as a
reduction of the principal amount of the secured claim with respect to the notes.


-----

    - If a bankruptcy petition were filed by or against us in the United States, the allowed claim for the notes
may be less than the principal amount of the notes stated in the indenture.

    - If a bankruptcy petition were filed by or against us under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code after the issuance
of the notes, the claim by any holder of the notes for the principal amount thereof may be allowed in an
amount equal to the sum of:

    - the original issue price of the notes; and

    - that portion of the stated principal amount of the notes that exceeds the issue price thereof, if any, that
does not constitute “unmatured interest” for the purposes of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

Any such discount that was not amortized as of the date of the bankruptcy filing would constitute
unmatured interest, which is not allowable as part of a bankruptcy claim under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
Accordingly, holders of the notes under these circumstances may receive an amount that is less than the principal
amount thereof stated in the indenture.

**_Because each guarantor’s liability under its guarantees may be reduced to zero, voided or released under certain_**
**_circumstances, holders of notes may not receive any payments from some or all of the guarantors._**

Holders of notes have the benefit of the guarantees of the guarantors. However, the guarantees by the
guarantors are limited to the maximum amount that the guarantors are permitted to guarantee under applicable law.
As a result, a guarantor’s liability under its guarantee could be reduced to zero, depending upon the amount of other
obligations of such guarantor. Further, under the circumstances discussed more fully above, a court under federal or
state fraudulent conveyance and transfer statutes could void the obligations under a guarantee (and any related
security interest) or further subordinate it to all other obligations of the guarantor. See “—Federal and state
fraudulent transfer laws permit a court, under certain circumstances, to void the notes and the guarantees, and the
liens securing the notes and the guarantees, subordinate claims in respect of the notes, the guarantees and the liens
securing the notes and the guarantees and/or require holders of the notes to return payments received from us in
respect of the guarantees and the liens and, if that occurs, you may not receive any payments on the notes.” In
addition, you will lose the benefit of a particular guarantee if it is released under certain circumstances described
under “Description of Notes—Guarantees.”

**_We may not be able to finance a change of control offer or asset sale offer required by the indenture that will_**
**_govern the notes._**

Upon a change of control triggering event, as defined under the indenture that will govern the notes, you
will have the right to require the Issuers to offer to purchase all of the notes then outstanding at a price equal to
101% of the principal amount of the notes, plus accrued interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of purchase. In
order to obtain sufficient funds to pay the purchase price of the outstanding notes, we expect that we would have to
refinance the notes. We cannot assure you that we would be able to refinance the notes on reasonable terms, if at all.
The Issuers’ failure to offer to purchase all outstanding notes or to purchase all validly tendered notes would be an
event of default under the indenture that will govern the notes. Such an event of default may cause the acceleration
of our other debt, including debt under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Our future debt also may contain
restrictions on repayment requirements with respect to specified events or transactions that constitute a change of
control under the indenture that will govern the notes.

In addition, upon the occurrence of certain specified asset sales, the Issuers will be required to offer to
purchase outstanding notes and indebtedness under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, at 100% of the principal
amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of purchase. The source of funds
for any such purchase of the notes will be the Issuers’ available cash or cash generated from the Issuers’ operations
or other sources, including borrowings, sales of assets or sales of equity. The Issuers may not be able to purchase the
notes upon such an asset sale offer because the Issuers may not have sufficient financial resources at the time of
such asset sale to make the required purchase of notes and such other indebtedness, or because restrictions in the
Issuers’ other indebtedness will not allow such purchase of the notes. Any of the Issuers’ future debt agreements


-----

may contain similar provisions. Accordingly, if such an asset sale were to occur, the Issuers may not have sufficient
financial resources to purchase the notes and such other indebtedness that the Issuers would be required to offer to
purchase or that become immediately due and payable as a result. The Issuers may require additional financing from
third parties to fund any such purchases, and we cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain financing on
satisfactory terms or at all. See “Description of Notes—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales.” The
Issuers’ failure to pay holders tendering notes and such other indebtedness upon such an asset sale would result in an
event of default under the indenture that will govern the notes.

**_We can enter into transactions like recapitalizations, reorganizations and other highly leveraged transactions that_**
**_do not constitute a change of control but that could adversely affect the holders of the notes._**

Certain important corporate events, such as leveraged recapitalizations, may not, under the indenture that
will govern the notes, constitute a “change of control” that would require the Issuers to purchase the notes,
notwithstanding the fact that such corporate events could increase the level of our indebtedness or otherwise
adversely affect our capital structure, credit ratings or the value of the notes. Therefore, we could, in the future, enter
into certain transactions, including acquisitions, reorganizations, refinancings or other recapitalizations, which
would not constitute a change of control under the indenture that will govern the notes, but that could increase the
amount of indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings.

**_Holders of notes may not be able to determine when a change of control giving rise to their right to have the_**
**_notes purchased has occurred following a sale of “substantially all” of our assets._**

The definition of change of control in the indenture that will govern the notes includes a phrase relating to
the sale of “all or substantially all” of our assets. There is no precise established definition of the phrase
“substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of notes to require the Issuers to
purchase its notes as a result of a sale of less than all of our assets to another person may be uncertain. See
“Description of Notes—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change of Control Triggering Event.”

**_An active trading market may not develop for the notes._**

The notes will constitute a new class of securities with no established trading market. We cannot assure you
that an active trading market for the notes will develop and continue after this offering. We do not intend to apply
for listing of the notes on any securities exchange or automated quotation system. Although we have been informed
by certain of the initial purchasers that they currently intend to make a market for the notes, they are not obliged to
do so and any market making may be discontinued at any time without notice.

The liquidity of, and trading market for, the notes may also be adversely affected by, among other things:

    - changes in the overall market for securities similar to the notes;

    - changes in our financial performance or prospects;

    - the prospects for companies in our industry generally;

    - the number of holders of the notes;

    - the interest of securities dealers in making a market for the notes;

    - the conditions of the financial markets; and

    - prevailing interest rates.

The condition of the financial markets and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated in the past and are likely
to fluctuate in the future, which could have an adverse effect on the market prices of the notes.


-----

Historically, the market for non-investment grade debt has been subject to disruptions that have caused
substantial volatility in the prices of securities that are similar to the notes. We cannot assure you that the market, if
any, for any of the notes will be free from similar disruptions or that any such disruptions may not adversely affect
the prices at which you may sell your notes. In addition, subsequent to their initial issuance, the notes may trade at a
discount from their initial offering price, depending upon prevailing interest rates, the market for similar notes, our
performance and other factors.

**_Holders of the notes will not be entitled to registration rights and the Issuers do not currently intend to register_**
**_the notes under applicable securities laws, and there are restrictions on your ability to transfer or resell the notes._**

The notes are being offered and sold pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act
and applicable state securities laws. Therefore, you may transfer or resell the notes in the United States only in a
transaction registered under or exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state
securities laws, and you may be required to bear the risk of your investment for an indefinite period of time. The
Issuers are not obligated, and do not intend, to register the notes under the Securities Act or to offer to exchange the
notes in an exchange offer registered under the Securities Act. The holders of the notes will not be entitled to require
the Issuers to register the notes for resale or otherwise. As a result, for so long as the notes remain outstanding, they
may be transferred or resold only in transactions exempt from the registration requirements of federal and applicable
state securities laws.

**_The indenture that will govern the notes has not been and will not be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act and_**
**_we will not be required to comply with the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act._**

The indenture that will govern the notes will not be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act and we will not
be required to comply with the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act. Therefore, holders of the notes will not be
entitled to the benefit of the provisions and protection of the Trust Indenture Act except to the extent there are
similar provisions in the indenture that will govern the notes.

**_A lowering or withdrawal of the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating agencies may adversely affect_**
**_the market price or liquidity of the notes._**

Credit rating agencies continually revise their ratings for the companies that they follow, including us.
Credit rating agencies also evaluate our industry as a whole and may change their credit ratings for us based on their
overall view of our industry. The notes offered hereby will have a non-investment grade rating on the issue date.
There can be no assurances that such rating will remain for any given period of time or that such rating will not be
lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in that rating agency’s judgment, future circumstances relating
to the basis of the rating, such as adverse changes, so warrant. Credit ratings are not recommendations to purchase,
hold or sell the notes, and may be revised or withdrawn at any time. Additionally, credit ratings may not reflect the
potential effect of risks relating to the structure or marketing of the notes. If the credit rating of the notes is
subsequently lowered or withdrawn for any reason, you may not be able to resell your notes without a substantial
discount.

**_The lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities have the discretion to release any guarantor under the_**
**_Senior Secured Credit Facilities in a variety of circumstances, which will cause such guarantor to be released_**
**_from its guarantee of the notes offered hereby and the Existing Notes, in which case any liens on the assets of_**
**_such guarantor in favor of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the notes offered hereby and the Existing Notes_**
**_will also be released._**

While any obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities remain outstanding, a guarantor’s
guarantee of the notes may be released without action by, or consent of, any holder of the notes or the trustee under
the indenture that will govern the notes, at the discretion of lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, if the
guarantor no longer guarantees obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or any other indebtedness, in
which case any liens on the assets of such guarantor in favor of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Existing
Notes and the notes offered hereby. See “Description of Notes.” The lenders under the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities will have the discretion to release the guarantees under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities in a variety of
circumstances. You will not have a claim as a creditor against any subsidiary that is no longer a guarantor of the


-----

notes, and the indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables, whether secured or unsecured, of those
non-guarantor subsidiaries will be structurally senior to claims of noteholders.

**_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the notes under which the guarantees will be_**
**_released automatically, without your consent or the consent of the trustee._**

Under various circumstances, the guarantees of the notes will be released automatically. The guarantee of a
subsidiary guarantor of the notes will be automatically released to the extent such subsidiary guarantor is released in
connection with a sale or other disposition of the equity interests of such subsidiary guarantor in a transaction not
prohibited by the indenture that will govern the notes. The indenture also will permit us to designate one or more of
the Issuer’s restricted subsidiaries that is a guarantor of the notes as an unrestricted subsidiary, which will result in
the guarantee of such subsidiary guarantor being automatically released. If a subsidiary guarantor is released from its
guarantee of the Term Loan Facilities or the Revolving Credit Facility or certain other indebtedness of the Issuers or
any other guarantor, other than in connection with a refinancing of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and such
other indebtedness or a payment under such guarantee, or a guarantor ceases to be a subsidiary as a result of any
foreclosure of any pledge or security interest securing the secured indebtedness, such subsidiary’s guarantee of the
notes offered hereby and the Existing Notes will be automatically released as well, in which case any liens on the
assets of such subsidiary in favor of the Term Loan Facilities or the Revolving Credit Facility, as applicable, and the
notes offered hereby and the Existing Notes will also be released. If the guarantee of any subsidiary guarantor is
released, no holder of the notes will have a claim as a creditor against that subsidiary, and the indebtedness and other
liabilities, including trade payables and preferred stock, if any, whether secured or unsecured, of that subsidiary will
be structurally senior to the claim of any holders of the notes. For a description of all circumstances in which a
guarantor’s subsidiary guarantee will be automatically released, see “Description of Notes—Guarantees.”

In addition, the guarantee by Holdings, and the pledge by Holdings of the Issuer’s equity, will be
automatically and unconditionally released if Holdings ceases to be the direct parent of the Issuer, including upon a
merger, consolidation or sale. See “Description of Notes—Guarantees.”

**_There are circumstances, other than the repayment or discharge of the notes, under which the Collateral and the_**
**_guarantees will be released automatically, without your consent or the consent of the Notes Collateral Agent, and_**
**_you may not realize any payment upon the release of such Collateral._**

Under various circumstances, the Collateral and guarantees will be released automatically, including:

    - upon a sale, transfer or other disposition of such Collateral (to a person that is not the Issuers or a
guarantor) in a transaction not prohibited under the indenture that will govern the notes. See
“Description of Notes—Release of Collateral”;

    - with respect to the equity interests of and Collateral held by a guarantor of the notes, upon the release
of such guarantor from its guarantees;

    - pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreements, upon any release in connection with a
foreclosure or exercise of remedies with respect to such Collateral by the controlling collateral agent in
accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreements;

    - upon the release of Excess Proceeds that remain unexpended after the conclusion of an Asset Sale
Offer conducted in accordance with the Indenture that will govern the notes (each capitalized term as
defined under the heading “Description of Notes”);

    - (x) if all other liens on such Collateral securing Equal Priority Obligations are released or will be
released simultaneously therewith (other than any release by, or as a result of, payment of the Equal
Priority Obligations) and (y) in the case of ABL Priority Collateral securing Senior ABL Revolving
Credit Obligations then outstanding, if the liens on such ABL Priority Collateral securing Senior ABL
Revolving Credit Obligations are released or will be released simultaneously therewith by the Senior


-----

ABL Credit Agreement Collateral Agent or otherwise pursuant to the Senior ABL Credit Agreement
(other than any release by, or as a result of, payment of the Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations);

    - if the release of such lien is approved, authorized or ratified by the required number of holders;

    - to the extent such Collateral becomes an Excluded Asset (as defined under the heading “Description of
Notes”); and

    - if the notes would be rated investment grade by either Moody’s or S&P after giving effect to such lien
release. See “Description of Notes—Release of Collateral.”

The indenture that will govern the notes will also permit us to designate one or more of the Issuer’s
restricted subsidiaries that is a guarantor of the notes as an unrestricted subsidiary. If the Issuers designate a
subsidiary guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary for purposes of the indenture that will govern the notes, all of the
liens on the equity interests of and any Collateral owned by that subsidiary or any of its subsidiaries and any
guarantees of the notes by that subsidiary or any of its subsidiaries will be released under the indenture that will
govern the notes. Designation of an unrestricted subsidiary will reduce the aggregate value of the Collateral securing
the notes to the extent that liens on the assets of the unrestricted subsidiary and its subsidiaries are released. In
addition, the creditors of any such unrestricted subsidiary and its subsidiaries will have a claim on the assets of the
unrestricted subsidiary and its subsidiaries senior to the claim of the holders of the notes.

**_We are not and will not be subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002._**

We are not subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”). Since we have not
registered the Existing Notes and will not register the notes under the Securities Act after this offering, we will not
be subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires public companies to have and maintain effective disclosure
controls and procedures to ensure timely disclosure of material information, and have management review the
effectiveness of those controls on a quarterly basis. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act also requires public companies to have
and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and preparation of financial statements, and have management review the
effectiveness of those controls on an annual basis (and have the independent auditor attest to the effectiveness of
such internal controls). We will not be required to comply with these requirements and therefore we may not have
comparable procedures in place as compared to other public companies.

**_If the Liens securing the notes are released as a result of an Investment Grade Event, as defined under the_**
**_heading “Description of Notes,” the notes will become unsecured and no Liens will be granted unless the Notes_**
**_have a lower than investment grade rating from each of Moody’s and S&P._**

If the Liens securing the notes are released as a result of an Investment Grade Event, the notes will become
unsecured and no Liens will be granted unless the Notes have a lower than investment grade rating from each of
Moody’s and S&P. Any pledge of collateral in favor of the Notes Collateral Agent and the other security documents
delivered after such date, could be avoidable in bankruptcy and if this were to occur, holders of the notes could lose
the benefit of such security interest. See “—Any future pledge of Collateral or guarantee may be avoidable in
bankruptcy.”

**_In the event that the Seller Notes Repurchase is not consummated on or before the Outside Date and the_**
**_other Escrow Release Conditions are not satisfied or the terms of the Escrow Agreement are not otherwise_**
**_complied with, the notes will be subject to a Special Mandatory Redemption, and as a result, you may not obtain_**
**_the return you expect on the notes._**

If the Seller Notes Repurchase is not consummated simultaneously with this offering, concurrently with the
closing of this offering, the Issuers will enter into the Escrow Agreement pursuant to which the Issuer will deposit
(or cause to be deposited) an amount equal to the gross proceeds of the offering into an escrow account for the notes
until the date that the Escrow Release Conditions are satisfied. The funds in the escrow account will be initially


-----

limited to the gross proceeds from the offering and will not be sufficient to pay the Special Mandatory Redemption
Price.

If, among other things, the Seller Notes Repurchase is not consummated on or prior to the Outside Date, the
Issuers will redeem, on the Special Mandatory Redemption Date in accordance with the terms of the indenture that
will govern the notes, all of the notes at the Special Mandatory Redemption Price. Upon such redemption, you may
not be able to reinvest the proceeds from the redemption in an investment that yields comparable returns.
Additionally, you may suffer a loss on your investment if you purchase the notes at a price greater than the issue
price of the notes. See “Description of Notes—Escrow of Gross Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.” The
ability of the holders of the notes to realize upon the funds of the escrow account may be subject to certain
bankruptcy law limitations in the event of a bankruptcy of the Issuers.

**_Between the time of the offering of the notes and the consummation of the Seller Notes Repurchase, the_**
**_parties to the Note Purchase Agreement may agree to modify or waive the terms or conditions of such document_**
**_without consent of the holders of notes._**

Prior to the consummation of the Seller Notes Repurchase, the parties to the Note Purchase Agreement may
agree to amendments or waivers of the terms thereof. Although the Escrow Agreement will provide as a condition to
the release of the funds in the escrow account that the Seller Notes Repurchase is to be consummated, this condition
will not preclude the transaction parties from making changes to the terms of the transaction or from waiving
conditions to the transaction that have an adverse effect on the holders of the notes, including a change in the
purchase price or to the structure of the Seller Notes Repurchase.

**_If the Issuers commence a bankruptcy or reorganization case or one is commenced against the Issuers,_**
**_bankruptcy laws may prevent the release of the escrowed funds._**

If the Issuers commence a bankruptcy or reorganization case, or one is commenced against the Issuers,
while amounts remain in the escrow account, applicable bankruptcy laws may prevent the Escrow Agent from
releasing the funds in the escrow account or applying those funds to effect a Special Mandatory Redemption of the
notes or otherwise applying those funds for the benefit of itself and the holders of the notes. The court adjudicating
that case might find that the escrow account is the property of the bankruptcy estate. Although the amounts in the
escrow account will be pledged as collateral for payment, if required, of the Special Mandatory Redemption Price of
the notes, the automatic stay provisions of the federal bankruptcy laws generally prohibit secured creditors from
foreclosing upon or disposing of a debtor’s property without bankruptcy court approval. As a result, holders of the
notes may not be able to have the funds in the escrow account applied at the time or in the manner contemplated by
the indenture that will govern the notes and could suffer a loss as a result.

In addition, if the court adjudicating the Issuers’ bankruptcy or reorganization case finds that the escrowed
funds are property of the bankruptcy estate, the court could authorize the use of these funds by the bankruptcy estate
or the bankruptcy trustee, if one is appointed, with or without restrictions. As a result, the holders of the notes could
become unsecured creditors of the bankruptcy estate. In such event, the only remedy available to the holders of the
notes would be to sue for payment on such notes.

**_We cannot assure you that the procedures for book-entry interests to be implemented through DTC will be_**
**_adequate to ensure the timely exercise of your rights under the notes._**

Unless and until notes in definitive registered form are issued in exchange for global notes, owners of
book-entry interests will not be considered owners or holders of the notes except in the limited circumstances
provided in the indenture governing such notes. DTC (or its nominee), will be the sole registered holder of the
global notes representing the applicable notes. After payment to DTC, we will have no responsibility or liability for
the payment of interest, principal, or other amounts to the owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly, if you own a
book-entry interest, you must rely on the procedures of DTC, and if you are not a participant in DTC, on the


-----

procedures of the participant through which you own your interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder
under the indenture governing such notes. See “Book Entry, Delivery and Form.”

Unlike the holders of the notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right to
act upon our solicitations for consents, requests for waivers, or other actions from holders of the notes. Instead, if
you own a book-entry interest, you will be permitted to act only to the extent you have received appropriate proxies
to do so from DTC. There can be no assurance that procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies will be
sufficient to enable you to vote on any request actions on a timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the indenture that will govern the notes, if you
own a book-entry interest, you will be restricted to acting through DTC. We cannot assure you that the procedures to
be implemented through DTC will be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of rights under the notes. See “Book
Entry, Delivery and Form.”

**_Holder of the notes may not be able to effect service of process or enforce judgments obtained against us outside_**
**_of the United States._**

The Issuers and the guarantors are organized under the laws of the United States. A substantial portion of
our assets are located in the United States and, as a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of
process or enforce judgments obtained against us outside the United States.

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

The table below sets forth the estimated sources and uses of funds in connection with the Seller Notes
Repurchase (and after the gross proceeds from this offering are released from escrow, if applicable), assuming it
occurred on March 31, 2023, and based on estimated amounts outstanding on that date. Actual amounts will vary
from the estimated amounts shown below depending on several factors, including, among others, changes made to
the sources of the contemplated financings and differences from our estimated fees and expenses.

If the Seller Notes Repurchase is not consummated simultaneously with the consummation of this offering,
the gross proceeds of this offering will be funded into escrow and, upon satisfaction of the Escrow Release
Conditions, the gross proceeds from this offering, together with borrowings under the New Term Loan B Facility
and cash on hand, will be used to fund the Seller Notes Repurchase as set forth below or, if applicable, such gross
proceeds will be used to fund the Special Mandatory Redemption as described herein. See “Summary—Escrow.”

In addition, (i) BCP Emerald will acquire the approximately 40% common equity interest of Copeland held by
Emerson through the Unit Sellers, reducing Emerson’s equity interest in Copeland to zero and (ii) Emerson will
receive cash proceeds of $1.5 billion.

**Overview**

We are a leading global manufacturer of mission critical compressors, controls, components and solutions
to the HVACR market. We provide products that help enhance human health and comfort, protect food quality and
safety, advance energy efficiency, and create an environmentally sustainable infrastructure. Key components in an
HVACR ecosystem include the compressor, controls, the condenser and the evaporator. We provide best-in-class
compressors, controls, components and solutions for residential, commercial, industrial and transportation
applications. We are the largest global manufacturer in our served markets with approximately 40% share in overall
global compression, including approximately 70% in the North America residential HVAC segment, and strong
positions within our non-compression offerings.

Our large installed base of more than 150 million HVAC compressor units globally drives profitable
aftermarket sales due to replacement dynamics, with approximately 80% of our net sales tied to repair or
replacement activity. Ongoing technology leadership is a key driver of our ability to capitalize on the replacement


-----

cycle, as each successive generation of compressor provides greater cost savings, energy efficiency and higher levels
of environmental sustainability impact.

We serve our customers through 27 global manufacturing facilities and 12 major global ER&D centers,
with a global headcount of approximately 18,000 employees. Global scale paired with localized manufacturing
enable us to think globally and act locally, creating a flexible and robust supply chain that is regionalized to provide
customers with a strong on-time delivery record. This advantage is derived not just from global operations, but also
from the breadth of our product offerings and our ability to meet customers’ requirements. Decades of research and
customer collaboration have ultimately yielded an unmatched and market leading global HVAC compressor
installed base.

**Our Products**

The Company’s businesses are primarily organized by product offering. The Company’s products are
organized into two broad categories - HVACR Technologies and Electronics and Controls. Geographically, we
organize through three world areas - Americas, Europe and Asia, Middle East and Africa (“AMEA”).

The served applications include, among others, heating and cooling including heat pump applications, food
service / retail / industrial refrigeration, perishable goods, transportation, healthcare / life sciences, and renewable
energy. The Company’s compression technologies enable higher efficiency in commercial and residential HVAC
units, as well as in commercial and industrial refrigeration units. The Company also has a solution portfolio that


-----

manages, monitors and controls refrigeration units in the commercial setting, as well as software solutions that
measure and monitor temperature conditions of refrigerated goods in transit. The Company’s industrial products are
designed into renewable energy processes including RNG and Biogas applications. In general, the company’s
technologies and solutions address global trends, including (i) the decarbonization and increased energy efficiency
of heating, cooling, refrigeration and industrial processes, (ii) the drive towards lower-GWP refrigerants and (iii) the
efficient transport of perishable goods including food and medicine. The Company now operates under the Copeland
brand, as well as the Sensi, Verdant, Vilter and White-Rodgers sub-brands.

**Comparability of Historical Financial Results**

**_The Transactions—the Acquisition and Financing Transactions_**

On October 30, 2022, the Company entered into a Transaction Agreement (“Transaction Agreement”) with
Emerson Electric Co. (“Emerson”), BCP Emerald Aggregator L.P. (“BCP”) and Merger Sub, whereby BCP agreed
to purchase, and Emerson agreed to sell, equity interests in JV NewCo following the Restructuring (as defined
below), for a purchase price of $13,647 million. Emerald JV Holdings L.P. (“Emerald” or “JV NewCo” or “the
Company” or “Copeland”), a Delaware limited partnership, was formed by Emerson to hold its Climate Technology
Business (“Climate Technologies” or “CT”) in connection with the acquisition of a majority stake in Climate
Technologies (the “Acquisition”) by certain investment funds affiliated with Blackstone Inc. (“Blackstone”). The
Company currently holds Climate Technologies after the completion of certain restructuring steps undertaken by
Emerson to transfer Climate Technologies to JV NewCo (the “Restructuring”). The Acquisition was consummated
on May 31, 2023 (the “Acquisition Date”).

The Acquisition was accounted for as a business combination under Accounting Standards Codification
805, Business Combinations. The purchase consideration was allocated to the identifiable assets and liabilities of
Copeland measured at their fair value as of the effective date of the Acquisition. Any excess of the purchase
consideration over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of Copeland was recognized as goodwill in
our consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2023 (Successor). As a result of the Acquisition, we
expect to incur higher depreciation, amortization, interest expense and higher cost of goods sold due to stepped up
inventory as compared to the Predecessor periods.

The Successor Statement of Operations reflects the results of the business following the closing of the
Acquisition. However, on May 19, 2023, Emerald Debt Merger Sub L.L.C (“Merger Sub”), a subsidiary of Emerald
JV Holdings, L.P., which was merged with and into EMRLD Borrower LP (“EMRLD Borrower”) on the
consummation of the Acquisition, and Emerald Co-Issuer Inc., a direct subsidiary of EMRLD Borrower, issued
senior secured notes in the aggregate principal amount of $2,275.0 million and aggregate principal amount of €455.0
million (or $500.0 million U.S. dollar equivalent, based on the exchange rate of approximately $1.10 per €1.00), (the
“Original Dollar Notes” and the “Original Euro Notes”, respectively, and collectively the “Initial Notes”). The
Company incurred $6.2 million of interest expense for the period from May 19, 2023, to May 31, 2023, related to
the Initial Notes, which has been recognized in the Successor Period.

In addition to the Initial Notes, in connection with the Acquisition, on May 31, 2023, EMRLD Borrower
entered into a 5-year senior secured term loan facility in an original aggregate principal amount of $450.0 million
(the “Term Loan A Facility”) and a 7-year senior secured term loan facility in an original aggregate principal
amount of $2,275.0 million (the “Original Term Loan B Facility” and, together with the Term Loan A Facility, the
“Term Loan Facilities”), and a 5-year senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal
amount of up to $700.0 million (the “Revolving Credit Facility” and, together with the Term Loan Facilities, the
“Senior Secured Credit Facilities”). As of March 31, 2024, the Company has $399.5 million of borrowing
availability under the Revolving Credit Facility subject to borrowing base capacity (including borrowing base
capacity in foreign jurisdictions after giving effect to approximately $9.1 million of letters of credit expected to be
outstanding thereunder), in each case, before giving effect to financing costs. Further, EMRLD Seller Notes Issuer
L.P., an entity owned by the Company, issued two senior unsecured notes to subsidiaries of Emerson in the
aggregate amount of $2,250.0 million (the “Seller Notes”). The borrowers/issuers under the Term Loan Facilities,
the Initial Notes, Revolving Credit Facility, and the Seller Notes (collectively, the “Financing Transactions” and,
together with the Acquisition, the “Transactions”) are wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company. Accordingly, in
periods after the Acquisition, we have recorded an increase in interest expense.


-----

**_The Term Loan B Facility Refinancing and New Notes Issuance_**

On February 6, 2024, EMRLD Borrower entered into an amendment to the Credit Agreement governing
the Term Loan Facilities, which provided for the incurrence of a new senior secured term “B” loan (the “Refinanced
Term Loan B Facility”) in an aggregate principal amount of $1,519.3 million. The Refinanced Term Loan B Facility
has identical terms to the Original Term Loan B Facility provided, however, that (a) borrowings under the
Refinanced Term Loan B Facility bear interest at the Term SOFR Rate plus a margin of between 2.25% and 2.50%
per annum (based on EMRLD Borrower’s first lien net leverage ratio), subject to a Term SOFR Rate floor of 0.00%
and (b) any voluntary prepayment, refinancing or repricing of the term loans under the Refinanced Term Loan B
Facility in connection with certain repricing transactions that occur on or prior to the six-month anniversary of the
closing of the Refinanced Term Loan B Facility are subject to a prepayment premium of 1.00% of the principal
amount of such term loans so prepaid, refinanced or repriced, subject to certain exceptions. In connection with the
Refinanced Term Loan B Facility, on February 6, 2024, the Company issued new senior secured notes in the
aggregate principal amount of $750.0 million, including $500.0 million of Dollar Notes (the “New Dollar Notes”)
and €230.0 (or $250.0 million U.S. dollar equivalent, based on the exchange rate of approximately $1.09 per €1.00)
of Euro Notes (the “New Euro Notes” and, collectively with the New Dollar Notes, the “New Notes”). The proceeds
of the Refinanced Term Loan B Facility, together with the proceeds of the New Notes and cash on hand were used
to refinance all of the Original Term Loan B Facility and to pay fees, costs and expenses related to the offering of
the New Notes and the Refinanced Term Loan B Facility. The New Dollar Notes were issued at a premium of
100.750, resulting in a premium of $3.8 million. The New Euro Notes were issued at a premium of 104.250,
resulting in a USD premium of approximately $10.6 million. The New Notes have the same terms as the Initial
Notes.

**_Separation from Emerson and operating as a standalone company_**

Following the Acquisition, Copeland is a standalone company with independent functions and operations.
However, prior to the Acquisition and Financing Transactions, see “—Comparability of Historical Financial
Results—The Acquisition and Financing Transactions,” the Climate Technologies Business historically operated as
part of Emerson and not as a standalone entity. The Predecessor period of each of the (i) consolidated and combined
financial statements and (ii) unaudited condensed, consolidated and combined financial statements and this section
present the historical financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Climate Technologies Business
as if it had operated on a standalone basis subject to Emerson’s control and include all accounts of the Climate
Technologies Business and its subsidiaries and affiliates on a consolidated basis. Intercompany transactions, profits
and balances among Climate Technologies Business entities have been eliminated in consolidation and combination.
The Predecessor period of each of the (i) consolidated and combined financial statements and (ii) unaudited
condensed, consolidated and combined financial statements were derived from Emerson’s financial statements and
accounting records and have been prepared in conformity with GAAP. Sale and purchase transactions between the
Climate Technologies Business and other Emerson affiliates are included in the unaudited condensed and
consolidated financial statements for the six months ended March 31, 2024 (Successor), the audited condensed and
consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2023 (Successor) and for the four months ended September
30, 2023 (Successor), the consolidated and combined financial statements as of September 30, 2022 (Predecessor)
and for the eight months ended May 31, 2023 (Predecessor) and the year ended September 30, 2022 (Predecessor),
as well as the unaudited condensed, consolidated and combined financial statements for the six months ended March
31, 2023 (Predecessor).

As a business of Emerson, the Climate Technologies Business was charged for costs directly related to its
business and was allocated a portion of Emerson’s general corporate costs. All of these costs were reflected in the
Predecessor period of the each of the (i) consolidated and combined financial statements and (ii) unaudited
condensed, consolidated and combined financial statements. The Climate Technologies Business participated in
various Emerson programs which included information technology services, employee benefits, medical insurance
and other programs. Costs associated with these programs were charged to the Climate Technologies Business based
on Emerson’s actual cost and the Climate Technologies Business’ relative level of usage.

Emerson provided certain oversight and support services, including assistance with management strategy,
logistics, marketing, finance, treasury, insurance, tax, human resources, legal, compliance and other activities. A
charge for these services and royalties was allocated to the Climate Technologies Business based principally on


-----

revenue. While management believes the methodologies and assumptions used to allocate these costs are reasonable,
each of the (i) consolidated and combined financial statements and (ii) unaudited condensed, consolidated and
combined financial statements for the Predecessor periods do not purport to represent the financial position, or the
results of operations, changes in equity, and cash flows of the Climate Technologies Business as a standalone entity,
or what they would have been had the Climate Technologies Business operated as a standalone entity during the
periods presented.

Income tax expense was recorded as if the Climate Technologies Business filed tax returns on a stand-alone
basis separate from Emerson. This separate return methodology applies the accounting guidance for income taxes to
the consolidated and combined carve-out financial statements as if the Climate Technologies Business was a standalone enterprise for the periods presented. Our operating results were included in Emerson’s consolidated U.S.
federal and state income tax returns or non-U.S. jurisdiction tax returns. The calculation of the Climate Technologies
Business’ income taxes involved considerable judgment and the use of both estimates and allocations that affect the
calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets, which
arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expenses.
Therefore, the tax liabilities and deferred taxes included in each of the (i) unaudited condensed, consolidated and
combined financial statements as of March 31, 2023 (Predecessor) and for the six months ended March 31, 2023
(Predecessor) and (ii) consolidated and combined financial statements as of September 30, 2022 (Predecessor) and
the eight months ended May 31, 2023 (Predecessor) and the year ended September 30, 2022 (Predecessor) may not
be reflective of our actual tax balances that were included in Emerson’s consolidated filings prior to the carve-out.

**Key Factors and Trends Affecting Our Results of Operations**

Our results of operations have been affected by the following factors and trends, which we expect will
continue to impact our future results:

**_Competitive Landscape_**

We operate in markets that are highly competitive and potentially volatile, and we compete on the basis of
product performance, quality, service and/or price across the industries and markets served. Our operations are
significantly dependent on the current and future business environment, including capital and consumer spending. A
significant element of our competitive strategy is to deliver solutions to our customers by manufacturing highquality products at the best relevant global cost. Various companies compete with us in one or more product lines
and the number of competitors varies by product line. Some of our competitors have substantially greater sales,
assets and financial resources than our Company, allowing them to invest in more extensive research and
development and/or marketing activity and making them better able to withstand adverse market conditions, and we
also compete with many smaller companies. There has been consolidation and new entrants (including nontraditional competitors) within our industry and there may be future consolidation and new entrants which could
result in increased competition and significantly alter the dynamics of the competitive landscape in which we
operate.

**_Constant Innovation_**

The success of new and improved products and services depends on their initial and continued acceptance
by our customers. Our business is affected by varying degrees of technological change and corresponding shifts in
customer demand, which result in unpredictable product transitions, shortened life cycles and increased importance
of being first to market with new products and services. We may experience difficulties or delays in the research,
development, production and/or marketing of new products and services which may negatively impact our operating
results and prevent us from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to continue to bring new
products and services to market.

As a result of our research and development efforts, we hold intellectual property rights that are important
to our business and include numerous patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and other confidential
information. This intellectual property may be subject to challenge, infringement, invalidation or circumvention by
third parties. Despite extensive security measures, our intellectual property may be subject to misappropriation
through unauthorized access of our information technology systems, employee theft, or other acts of industrial


-----

espionage. Should the Company be unable to adequately defend or protect its intellectual property, it may suffer
competitive harm.

**_Raw Materials & Components_**

Our major requirements for raw materials include steel, copper, cast iron, electronics, aluminum, brass and,
to a lesser extent, plastics and petroleum-based chemicals. We seek multiple sources of supply for each of our major
requirements in order to avoid significant dependence on any one or a few suppliers. However, the availability of
and prices for raw materials, parts and components may be subject to curtailment or change due to, among other
things, suppliers’ allocation to other purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers, changes in exchange rates
and prevailing price levels. In addition, our facilities, supply chains, distribution systems, and products may be
impacted by natural or man-made disruptions, including armed conflict, damaging weather or other acts of nature,
pandemics or other public health crises or other events.

**_Concentration of Revenue_**

We derive a significant portion of our sales from a limited number of customers, and such concentration
may continue in the future. The loss of, or significant reduction in sales to, one or more major customers or groups
of customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
Further, the addition of new major customers in the future could increase our customer concentration risks as
described above.

**_Economic Conditions_**

Accelerated and pronounced economic pressures, such as the continuing inflationary cost pressure on labor
and the goods and services we rely upon to serve our customers, have had and continue to have a significant impact
on our cost structure and capital expenditures. Our sales in the residential and commercial new construction markets
correlate to the number of new homes and buildings that are built, which in turn is influenced by cyclical factors
such as interest rates, inflation, availability of financing, consumer spending habits and confidence, employment
rates and other macroeconomic factors over which we have no control. Significant components of our operating
expenses vary directly as we experience a heightened pace of inflation, and we seek to dynamically manage our cost
structure using price actions with our customers in response to such changes. Given a portion of our revenue is tied
to a contractual lookback provision with respect to price actions, there is a timing lag in our ability to recover
increased costs under those contracts during periods of rapid inflation. The contract lag and inability to increase
prices real-time to offset increased costs and inflationary pressures, or otherwise mitigate the impact of these
macroeconomic conditions and market disruptions on our business, may increase our costs of doing business and
reduce our margins in any given period.

**_Regulatory Environment_**

Increased public awareness and concern regarding global climate change may result in more international,
federal, and/or state or other stakeholder requirements or expectations that could result in more restrictive or
expansive standards, such as stricter limits on greenhouse gas emissions or more prescriptive reporting of
environmental, social, and governance metrics. There continues to be a lack of consistent climate change legislation
and standards, which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty. Further, these regulatory changes may result in
changes in market demand for certain products manufactured and sold by the Company. The impact of these
standards may have an impact on the Company’s business, capital expenditures, results of operations, financial
condition and competitive position.

**Non-GAAP Financial Information**

We use various non-GAAP financial metrics to analyze and evaluate the performance of our business and
to provide a greater understanding with respect to our results of operations. These include EBITDA, Adjusted
EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Standalone Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma
Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow.


-----

Certain of these key performance measures are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP.
In evaluating our performance as measured by these non-GAAP measures, management recognizes and considers
the limitations of these measures. Other companies in our industry may calculate them differently than we do, or
may not calculate them at all, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. Because of these limitations, these
non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for net income or any other measure
calculated in accordance with GAAP, as applicable, and should be considered together with GAAP financial
measures.

**_EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Standalone Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma_**
**_Adjusted EBITDA, and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Margin_**

We define EBITDA as net earnings adjusted for interest expense, net, income tax, depreciation and
amortization expense. Adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA as further adjusted to exclude certain items that impact the
comparison of the performance of our businesses either period-over-period or with other businesses as more fully
described below. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales for the
respective period. Standalone Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA further adjusted for standalone
costs. We define Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA as Standalone Adjusted EBITDA further adjusted for the estimated
normalized “run-rate” benefit from pricing actions and cost saving initiatives that are expected to be realized by the
end of fiscal 2026. Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA margin is calculated as Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA divided by
net sales for the respective period. We use EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Standalone
Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Margin to compare our
operating results on a consistent basis.

We present EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Standalone Adjusted EBITDA, Pro
Forma Adjusted EBITDA, and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Margin because we believe they assist investors and
analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do
not believe are indicative of our core operating performance, and we believe that these metrics provide useful
information to investors in understanding and evaluating our operating results. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA,
Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Standalone Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, and Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA Margin do not reflect certain cash expenses that we are obligated to make, and although depreciation and
amortization are non-cash charges, assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the
future, and EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Standalone Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma
Adjusted EBITDA, and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Margin do not reflect any cash requirements for such
replacements.

Our non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered superior to or a substitute for the results
of operations or cash flow prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures have
limitations associated with their use as compared to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, in that they may
be different from, and therefore not comparable to, similar measures used by other companies.

**_Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow_**

We define Free Cash Flow as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Adjusted Free
Cash Flow is Free Cash Flow less partnership distributions. We use Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow to
evaluate our ability to generate cash that can be used for working capital requirements, interest, repayment of
indebtedness, member distributions, acquisitions, and for continued re-investment into our business.

**Components of Results of Operations**

**_Net sales_**

We generate revenue principally from the sales of manufactured products. Revenue is recognized with the
transfer of control which is generally when a product is shipped to a customer, the customer has legal title to the
product, and the Company has a right to payment for such product. Although products are generally sold at fixed
prices, certain arrangements include rebates, cash discounts or penalties which are accounted for as variable


-----

consideration. The Company records a reduction to revenue at the time of sale to reflect the ultimate amount of
consideration it expects to receive. The Company’s estimates are updated quarterly and based on historical
experience, trend analysis, and expected market conditions.

**_Cost of sales_**

Cost of sales consists of product costs, including the cost of materials, direct and indirect labor costs,
overhead, certain depreciation, shipping and handling costs and import expenses.

**_Selling, general and administrative expenses_**

Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses consist of corporate management and support
functions, including general management, legal, accounting, finance, human resources, sales, marketing, and other
functions not directly associated with revenue generation activities. SG&A expenses include salaries, bonuses and
other payroll-related benefits, general operating expenses such as occupancy costs, information technology
infrastructure, travel, freight out, advertising and marketing expenses, as well as professional services and consulting
expenses.

**_Transaction and separation expenses_**

Transaction and separation expenses are predominantly associated with the Acquisition, covering key items
such as due-diligence costs, legal fees, advisory charges, breakage fees from standby debt financing, insurance
premium costs, real estate transfer taxes, and stand-up costs, inclusive of financial and systems-related advisor fees
as well as IT and digital marketing costs, primarily associated with functional advisory and consulting fees to
support the company’s separation and stand-up organization post-Acquisition.

**_Amortization of intangibles_**

Amortization of intangibles relates to expense associated with acquired customer relationships, developed
technology, tradename, backlog, and other definite-lived intangible assets.

**_Other expense (income), net_**

Other expense (income), net is composed of several items that are individually immaterial including
restructuring expense, foreign currency loss (gain), and other items.

**_Interest (expense) income, net_**

Interest (expense) income, net consists primarily of accrued interest on third-party and related party debt
obligations and related amortization of debt discounts, premiums and deferred issuance costs, as well as interest
income from third party deposits and related party debt.

**_Income tax benefit (expense)_**

Effective in the Successor period, substantially all U.S. operations are owned by an entity treated as a
partnership for U.S. tax purposes, which generally is not subject to U.S. income tax. Refer to Note 6 to our
unaudited condensed and consolidated financial statements for information regarding our tax expense.

Prior to the Acquisition, the Company’s operations were included in Emerson’s combined US and non-US
income tax returns in most locations. As such, income tax expense was calculated following the separate return
method, which applies ASC 740, Income Taxes, as if the Company was a stand-alone enterprise and a separate
taxpayer in each jurisdiction for the periods presented. The calculation requires considerable judgement and as a
result, the Company’s deferred income tax rate and deferred tax balances may differ from those in Emerson’s
historical results.

**_Net sales_**

Net sales were $2,199.3 million for the six months ended March 31, 2024 (Successor) and $2,315.7 million
for the six months ended March 31, 2023 (Predecessor). The net sales decline of 5% year-over-year reflected an
approximately 6% decrease in volumes offset by an approximately 1% increase in net pricing driven by falling
commodity costs and higher sales prices. Regionally, Europe net sales were down 30%, AMEA net sales were down
3% and Americas net sales were down 1%. Overall, volume softness was driven by channel inventory normalization
and global economic headwinds.


-----

**_Cost of sales_**

Cost of sales were $1,442.2 million for the six months ended March 31, 2024 (Successor) and $1,543.4
million for the six months ended March 31, 2023 (Predecessor). Gross margin increased by 1.0% year-over-year to
34.4% due to higher sales prices and deflationary impacts on raw materials, partially offset by wage and other inflation
deleverage on lower sales volumes.

**_Selling, general and administrative expenses_**

Selling, general and administration expenses were $314.0 million for the six months ended March 31, 2024
(Successor) and $320.6 million for the six months ended March 31, 2023 (Predecessor). The overall decrease in fiscal
year 2024 was primarily driven by cost control and execution of cost savings initiatives partially offset by stand-alone
costs incurred during 2024.

**_Transaction and separation expenses_**

Transaction and separation expenses were $43.8 million for the six months ended March 31, 2024 (Successor)
and zero for the six months ended March 31, 2023 (Predecessor). Transaction and separation expenses in the Successor
period included costs primarily associated with legal, IT, marketing, HR and finance advisory and consulting fees to
support the Company’s separation and stand-up organization post-Acquisition.

**_Amortization of intangibles_**

Intangible amortization expense was $286.2 million for the six months ended March 31, 2024 (Successor)
and $10.5 million for the six months ended March 31, 2023 (Predecessor). The increase year-over-year was primarily
driven by the fair value step up of the Company’s acquired intangible assets and resulting increase in amortization
basis following the Acquisition.

**_Other expense (income), net_**

Other expense, net, was $37.5 million for the six months ended March 31, 2024 (Successor) and $8.1 million
for the six months ended March 31, 2023 (Predecessor). The overall increase period over period was primarily driven
by the impact of higher foreign currency losses as well as higher restructuring costs in 2024.

**_Loss on extinguishment of debt_**

Loss on extinguishment of debt was $96.8 million for the six months ended March 31, 2024 (Successor) and
zero for the six months ended March 31, 2023 (Predecessor). The loss was driven by the refinancing of the Original
Term Loan B Facility on February 6, 2024.

**_Interest (expense) income, net_**

Interest (expense) income, net was $(254.8) million for the six months ended March 31, 2024 (Successor)
and $7.4 million for the six months ended March 31, 2023 (Predecessor). The increase in interest expense year-overyear was a result of the Initial Financing Transactions and related interest expense in the Successor period.

**_Income tax benefit (expense)_**

Income tax benefit (expense) was $(0.5) million and $(132.8) million resulting in effective tax rates of (0.2%)
and 30.1% for the six months ended March 31, 2024 (Successor) and six months ended March 31, 2023 (Predecessor),
respectively. Effective beginning with the Successor period, substantially all U.S. operations are owned by an entity
treated as a partnership for U.S. tax purposes, which generally is not subject to U.S. income tax. This results in an
effective tax rate for the Successor period that is significantly lower than the Predecessor periods.

**_Net sales_**

Net sales were $1,676.9 million and $3,162.3 million for the four months ended September 30, 2023
(Successor) and eight months ended May 31, 2023 (Predecessor), respectively, and $5,060.2 million for the year
ended September 30, 2022 (Predecessor). For the Combined year ended September 30, 2023, compared to the year
ended September 30, 2022, net sales decreased 4.0%, reflecting a 7.0% decrease in volumes and a 1.0% unfavorable
foreign currency impact, partially offset by a 3.0% increase in net pricing. By region, net sales were up 11.0% in
Europe, down 7.0% in the Americas and down 15.0% in AMEA year-over-year. Volume declines were driven by
softness in the U.S. residential market as well as in Singapore and the Middle East, partially offset by strength in
Latin America and rebounds in China due to COVID-related shutdowns easing.

**_Cost of sales_**

Cost of sales were $1,197.1 million for the four months ended September 30, 2023 (Successor), $2,077.8
million for the eight months ended May 31, 2023 (Predecessor), and $3,489.4 million for the year ended September
30, 2022 (Predecessor). Gross margin increased by 1.3% percentage points to 32.3% in the Combined year ended
September 30, 2023 due to higher sales prices, deflationary impacts on raw materials, and impacts of cost
reductions, which were partially offset by wage and other inflation.

**_Selling, general and administrative expenses_**

Selling, general and administration expenses were $210.8 million for the four months ended September 30,
2023 (Successor), $426.3 million for the eight months ended May 31, 2023 (Predecessor), and $611.6 million for the
year ended September 30, 2022 (Predecessor). The overall increase in the Combined year ended September 30, 2023
was primarily driven by higher SG&A costs due to wage inflation, higher-stock compensation charges in the
predecessor and successor periods.

**_Transaction and separation expenses_**

Transaction and separation expenses were $177.0 million for the four months ended September 30, 2023
(Successor). There were no such expenses in either the eight months ended May 31, 2023 (Predecessor) or year
ended September 30, 2022 (Predecessor) periods. Transaction and separation expenses in the Successor Period


-----

included buyer transaction expenses of $50.0 million comprised of due diligence costs, legal fees, and advisory
charges; breakage fees from standby debt financing amounting to $52.0 million; buyer incurred stand-up costs
totaling $25.2 million including recruiting, IT, treasury, and other functions; $20.5 million relating to a
representation and warranty insurance purchased as part of the Acquisition, $1.8 million in real estate transfer taxes,
and separation costs of $27.4 million.

**_Amortization of intangibles_**

Intangible amortization expense was $342.4 million for the four months ended September 30, 2023
(Successor), $13.7 million for the eight months ended May 31, 2023 (Predecessor), and $21.1 million for the year
ended September 30, 2022 (Predecessor). The overall increase in the Combined year ended September 30, 2023 was
primarily driven by the Successor Period, which included the fair value step up of the Company’s acquired
intangible assets and resulting increase in amortization basis following the Acquisition.

**_Other expense (income), net_**

Other expense (income), net, was $(3.2) million for the four months ended September 30, 2023
(Successor), $41.8 million for the eight months ended May 31, 2023 (Predecessor), and $5.7 million for the year
ended September 30, 2022 (Predecessor). The overall increase in the Combined year ended September 30, 2023 was
primarily driven by higher restructuring costs as well as a $28.2 million asbestos-related charge.

**_Interest (expense) income, net_**

Interest (expense) income, net was $(178.9) million for the four months ended September 30, 2023
(Successor), $11.2 million for the eight months ended May 31, 2023 (Predecessor), and $1.5 million for the year
ended September 30, 2022 (Predecessor). This overall increase in interest expense in the Combined year ended
September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by the Successor period, in which there was an increase to interest
expense as a result of the Financing Transactions.

**_Income tax benefit (expense)_**

Income tax benefit (expense) was $23.3 million resulting in an effective tax rate of 5.5% for the four
months ended September 30, 2023 (Successor), $(172.7) million resulting in an effective tax rate of 28.2% for the
eight months ended May 31, 2023 (Predecessor), and $(193.4) million resulting in an effective tax rate of 20.7% for
the year ended September 30, 2022 (Predecessor). Effective beginning with the four-months ended September 30,
2023 (Successor), substantially all U.S. operations are owned by an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. tax
purposes, which generally is not subject to U.S. income tax. This results in an effective tax rate for the Successor
period that is significantly lower than the Predecessor periods, because in such prior periods the U.S. operations
were owned by an entity treated as a corporation for U.S. tax purposes, and thus were subject to U.S. income tax.

**_Net sales_**

Net sales were $5,060.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 (Predecessor), an increase of
$599.7 million, or 13.4%, compared to $4,460.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2021 (Predecessor).
Underlying sales were up approximately 14.8%, largely reflecting the impact of 10.6% from higher prices and 4.2%
from higher volume, while foreign currency translation had a 1.4% unfavorable impact.

**_Cost of sales_**

Cost of sales were $3,489.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 (Predecessor), an increase of
$506.0 million, or 17.0%, compared to $2,983.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2021 (Predecessor),
primarily due to higher sales volume and higher materials costs. Gross margin decreased by 2.1 percentage points to
31.0%, as price less net material cost inflation was favorable but had a dilutive impact on margins. Higher freight
and other inflation also negatively impacted margins.

**_Selling, general and administrative expenses_**

Selling, general and administrative expenses were $611.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2022
(Predecessor), a decrease of $11.5 million, or 1.8%, compared to $623.1 million for the year ended September 30,
2021 (Predecessor). SG&A as a percent of sales decreased 1.9 percentage points to 12.1%, reflecting leverage on
higher sales and lower stock compensation expense of $6.8 million due to a lower share price of Emerson’s stock
during fiscal 2022.

**_Amortization of intangibles_**

Intangible amortization expense was $21.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 (Predecessor), a
decrease of $1.9 million, or 8.2% compared to $23.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2021 (Predecessor),
primarily due to various immaterial changes.


-----

**_Other expense (income), net_**

Other expense (income), net, was $5.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 (Predecessor) and $(34.0)
million for the year ended September 30, 2021 (Predecessor). The over change was due to a pretax gain on the sale of
the Company’s 40.0% interest in Ruking in January 2021.

**_Interest (expense) income, net_**

Interest (expense) income, net was $1.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 (Predecessor), a decrease
of $0.1 million, or 6.3% compared to $1.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2021 (Predecessor), primarily due
to various immaterial changes.

**_Income tax benefit (expense)_**

Income taxes were $193.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 (Predecessor), an increase of
$16.3 million, or 9.2%, compared to $177.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2021 (Predecessor), resulting
in effective tax rates of 20.7% and 20.4% in 2022 and 2021, respectively.

**Financial Position, Liquidity and Capital Resources**

Our primary sources of liquidity include our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations
and availability under our Revolving Credit Facility. Our primary uses of liquidity are operating expenses, funding
of our debt requirements, separation-related activities, and capital expenditures.

We believe that our available cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, and availability under
our Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs, including principal and interest
payments on debt obligations, capital expenditures, anticipated working capital requirements, and operating
requirements, including those related to salaries, wages, and other liquidity requirements associated with operations
for the foreseeable future. The Company also has certain contractual obligations primarily related to operating
leases. We believe our liquidity position at March 31, 2024 remains strong and we will continue to closely monitor
and proactively manage our liquidity as economic conditions change.

**_Operating Activities_**

Operating cash flows were $206.5 million for the six months ended March 31, 2024 (Successor), and
$244.2 million for the six months ended March 31, 2023 (Predecessor). The change in operating cash flows yearover-year was primarily due to cash spending for separation costs in 2024 which did not occur in the Predecessor
period.


-----

Operating cash flows were $274.2 million and $428.5 million for the four months ended September 30,
2023 (Successor) and eight months ended May 31, 2023 (Predecessor) respectively, and $825.4 million for the year
ended September 30, 2022 (Predecessor). The change in the Combined year ended September 30, 2023 was
primarily due to lower operating earnings partially offset by lower operating working capital investment.

Operating cash flows were $825.4 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 (Predecessor), a
decrease of $42.1 million, or 4.9%, compared to $867.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2021
(Predecessor), reflecting higher operating working capital due to increased sales, partially offset by higher net
earnings.

**_Investing Activities_**

Investing cash outflows were $144.7 million for the six months ended March 31, 2024 (Successor), and
$1,089.2 million for the six months ended March 31, 2023 (Predecessor). The change in investing cash flows yearover-year was primarily driven by the related party loan payments of $947.3 million in the Predecessor period.

Investing cash outflows were $4,245.8 million and $1,122.6 million for the four months ended September
30, 2023 (Successor) and eight months ended May 31, 2023 (Predecessor) respectively, and $202.9 million for the
year ended September 30, 2022 (Predecessor). The change in the Combined year ended September 30, 2023 was
primarily driven by the Transactions (net of cash assumed) amounting to $5,098.9 million in the Successor period as
well as an increase in capital expenditures.

Investing cash outflows were $202.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 (Predecessor), an
increase of $124.0 million, or 157.2%, compared with $78.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2021
(Predecessor). This increase in investing cash outflows was primarily driven by $72.1 million of divestiture proceeds
received in the year ended September 30, 2022 (Predecessor) compared to none received in the year ended
September 30, 2021 (Predecessor) and an increase in capital expenditures of $69.6 million in the year ended
September 30, 2022 (Predecessor) from $128.3 million in the year ended September 30, 2021 (Predecessor).

**_Financing Activities_**

Financing cash inflows (outflows) were $(177.9) million for the six months ended March 31, 2024
(Successor), and $827.3 million for the six months ended March 31, 2023 (Predecessor). The change in financing
cash flows year-over-year was primarily driven by the related party loan receipt of $947.3 million in the Predecessor
period, as well as the net paydown of $100.0 million on the Revolving Credit Facility and partner distributions of
$69.9 million in the Successor period, partially offset by the net transfers to Emerson of $(120.0) million in the
Predecessor period.

Financing cash inflows (outflows) were $4,434.4 million, and $731.5 million for the four months ended
September 30, 2023 (Successor), and eight months ended May 31, 2023 (Predecessor) respectively, and $(660.5)
million for the year ended September 30, 2022 (Predecessor). The change in the Combined year ended September
30, 2023 was primarily driven by the Successor period, which included an inflow of cash from the Financing
Transactions.

Financing cash outflows were $660.5 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 (Predecessor), a
decrease of $97.7 million, or 12.9%, compared with $758.2 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021
(Predecessor). This primarily represents changes in the cash pool balance accounts in the cash pooling arrangement
with Emerson.

**Contractual Obligations**

We have committed cash outflows related to pension benefit obligations, long-term debt, and operating
lease agreements. Refer to Notes 12, 13 and 16 to our unaudited condensed and consolidated financial statements
and to Notes 11, 12, and 13 to our audited consolidated financial statements for the Successor period included


-----

elsewhere in this offering memorandum for additional information. We have immaterial short-term and long-term
contractual obligations.

**_Borrowings Post Financing Transactions_**

As of March 31, 2024, after giving effect to the Transactions as well as the extinguishment of the Original
Term Loan B Facility and the issuance of the Refinanced Term Loan B Facility, we have approximately $5,438.7
million in total third-party indebtedness outstanding, none of which is subordinated and all of which is senior
secured indebtedness, consisting of $1,965.5 million of borrowings under the Term Loan Facilities, and $3,523.2
million (equivalent) of the Initial Notes, net of $49.9 million in unamortized discount, premium, and debt issuance
costs. In addition, as of March 31, 2024, we have approximately $399.5 million of availability to incur additional
secured indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility, subject to borrowing base capacity (after giving effect to
approximately $9.1 million of letters of credit expected to be outstanding before giving effect to the financing costs).

Further, the Company has outstanding indebtedness to related parties comprised of the Seller Notes,
amounting to approximately $2,344.9 million as of March 31, 2024, inclusive of paid-in-kind interest, which is
structurally subordinated to any debt owed to third parties.

As market conditions warrant, we and our equityholders, including Blackstone, Emerson, and their
affiliates and members of management, may from time to time, depending upon market conditions, seek to
repurchase debt securities that we have issued or repay borrowings under our credit facilities, including the Initial
Notes and borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, in privately negotiated or open market
transactions, by tender offer or otherwise, and such repurchases may be at prices below par and such repurchases
may be for a material amount of the relevant debt securities or loans.

**Off Balance Sheet Arrangements**

As of March 31, 2024, the Company did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements.

**Critical Accounting Policies**

Preparation of the Company’s financial statements requires management to make judgments, assumptions
and estimates regarding uncertainties that could affect reported revenue, expenses, assets, liabilities and equity. The
most significant areas where management judgments and estimates impact the financial statements are described
below. Actual results in these areas could differ materially from management’s estimates under different
assumptions or conditions. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated
financial statements and related notes.

For the Predecessor periods, the Company’s financial statements were prepared on a stand-alone basis
derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of Emerson. The financial statements for
the Predecessor periods are presented as carve-out financial statements and reflect the combined historical results of
operations, financial position and cash flows of Climate Technologies, as if such financial statements were
historically managed this way, in conformity with GAAP.

**_Business Combination_**

The Company accounts for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. This
method requires the recording of acquired assets, including separately identifiable intangible assets, at their
acquisition date fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the identifiable net
assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. The determination of the estimated fair value of assets acquired requires
management’s judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions
with respect to the weighted average cost of capital, discount rate, prospective financial information including
revenue growth rate, EBITDA margin, customer attrition rates, royalty rates, obsolescence factors, asset lives and
market multiples, among other items. When necessary, the Company consults with external advisors to help
determine fair value. For non-observable market values, the Company may determine fair value using acceptable


-----

valuation principles, including the excess earnings, relief from royalty, lost profit or cost methods. Management’s
estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and
unpredictable, and as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. In addition, unanticipated events and
circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates.

During the measurement period, which is one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record
adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon
conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.

**_Revenue Recognition_**

In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, Revenue from Contracts with
_Customers, the Company evaluates its contracts with customers to identify the promised goods or services and_
recognize revenue for the identified performance obligations at the amount the Company expects to be entitled to in
exchange for those goods or services. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good
or service to a customer. Revenue is recognized when, or as performance obligations are satisfied, and control has
transferred to the customer, typically when products are shipped or delivered, title and risk of loss pass to the
customer, and the Company has a present right to payment.

The vast majority of the Company’s revenues are performance obligations related to the sale of
manufactured products which are recognized at a point in time when control transfers in accordance with shipping
terms. In limited circumstances, contracts include multiple performance obligations, where revenue is recognized
separately for each good or service, as well as contracts where revenue is recognized over time as control transfers
to the customer.

For revenues recognized over time, the Company typically uses an input method to determine progress and
recognize revenue, based on costs incurred. The Company believes costs incurred closely correspond with its
performance under the contract and the transfer of control to the customer.

In sales arrangements that involve multiple performance obligations, revenue is allocated based on the
relative standalone selling price for each performance obligation. Observable selling prices from actual transactions
are used whenever possible. In other instances, the Company determines the standalone selling price based on thirdparty pricing or management’s best estimate.

Payment terms vary but are generally short-term in nature. The Company’s long-term contracts, where
revenue is generally recognized over time, are billed as work progresses in accordance with the contract terms and
conditions, either at periodic intervals or upon achievement of certain milestones. The timing of revenue recognition
and billings under these contracts results in either unbilled receivables (contract assets) when revenue recognized
exceeds billings, or customer advances (contract liabilities) when billings exceed revenue recognized. Unbilled
receivables are reclassified to accounts receivable when an unconditional right to consideration exists, typically
when a milestone in the contract is achieved. The Company does not evaluate whether the transaction price includes
a significant financing component for contracts where the time between cash collection and performance is less than
one year.

Certain arrangements with customers include variable consideration, typically in the form of rebates, cash
discounts or penalties. Other than standard product warranty provisions, sales arrangements provide no other post
shipment obligations on the Company. In most instances, returns are limited to product quality issues. The Company
records a reduction to revenue at the time of sale to reflect the ultimate amount of consideration it expects to receive.
The Company’s estimates are updated quarterly based on historical experience, trend analysis, and expected market
conditions. Variable consideration is typically not constrained at the time revenue is recognized.

The Company records amounts billed to customers for the costs of shipping and handling in sales
transactions as Revenue and such costs are not considered separate performance obligations.


-----

**_Goodwill and Other Intangibles Impairment Testing_**

The Company amortizes definite-lived intangible assets on a straight-line basis over their useful lives.
Goodwill is not amortized and is required to be assessed at least annually for impairment, or more frequently if
triggering events indicate a possible impairment. The Company continually evaluates financial performance,
economic conditions and other recent developments in assessing if a triggering event indicates that the carrying
value of goodwill is impaired. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level by first performing a
qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less
than its carrying value. If the reporting unit does not pass the qualitative assessment, then a quantitative assessment
is performed to compare the reporting unit’s carrying value to its fair value. Estimated fair values are developed
primarily under an income approach that discounts estimated future cash flows using risk adjusted interest rates, as
well as earnings multiples or other techniques as warranted. Fair values are subject to changes in underlying
economic conditions. Alternatively, we are permitted to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to
performing the quantitative assessment. Goodwill is considered impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit
exceeds its fair value. The fair value of the reporting unit is based on a discounted cash flow model involving several
assumptions.

Identifiable intangible assets consist of intellectual property, trade names, developed technology, backlog,
and customer relationships and are also subject to evaluation for potential impairment if events or circumstances
indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.

No goodwill or intangible asset impairment was recorded for any of the periods presented.

**_Stock-based Compensation_**

The Company measures equity-classified stock-based compensation awards at their grant date fair value,
whereas liability-classified awards are remeasured to fair value at each reporting period. Expense for stock-based
compensation awards is recognized over the requisite service period and forfeitures are accounted for as they occur.

**_Inventories_**

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value and are valued based on standard costs
which approximate average costs. Cost standards are revised at the beginning of each fiscal year. The annual effect
of resetting standards plus operating variances incurred during each period are allocated between inventories and
recognized in cost of sales as products are sold.

**_Recent Accounting Pronouncements_**

Refer to Note 1 of the unaudited condensed and consolidated financial statements for the Successor period
as well as Note 1 to the audited consolidated and combined financial statements for Predecessor period, under the
caption “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk**

**_Foreign Currency Risk_**

In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates
and commodity prices. The Company’s foreign currency exposures relate to transactions denominated in currencies
that differ from the functional currencies of its subsidiaries, principally Mexican pesos. Foreign exchange forwards
are utilized, as needed, to hedge foreign currency exposures impacting sales or cost of sales transactions, firm
commitments, or the fair value of assets and liabilities. Based on a hypothetical 10.0% weakening in the U.S. dollar
across all currencies, the potential losses in future earnings, fair value or cash flows are not material.


-----

**_Commodities_**

Commodity exposures are price fluctuations on forecasted purchases of copper and aluminum. All
derivatives are associated with specific underlying exposures and the Company does not hold derivatives for trading
or speculative purposes. The initial duration of hedge positions is less than two years. Based on a hypothetical 10%
decrease in commodity prices or a 10.0% weakening in the U.S. dollar across all currencies, the potential losses in
future earnings, fair value or cash flows are not material.

**_Interest Rate Risk_**

As of March 31, 2024, we have approximately $5,438.7 million of total third-party indebtedness
outstanding, including $1,965.5 million of borrowings at variable interest rates under our Term Loan Facilities. A
0.25% increase in the rate of interest under our Term Loan Facilities would increase our annual interest expense by
approximately $7.2 million. This amount would increase to the extent any additional variable interest rate
borrowings are made on our Revolving Credit Facility.

**BUSINESS**

**Our Company**

We are a leading global manufacturer of mission critical compressors, controls, components and solutions
to the HVACR market. We provide products that help enhance human health and comfort, protect food quality and
safety, advance energy efficiency, and create environmentally sustainable infrastructure. Key components in an
HVACR ecosystem include the compressor, controls, the condenser and the evaporator. We provide best-in-class
compressors, controls, components and solutions for residential, commercial, industrial and transportation
applications. We are the largest global manufacturer in our served markets with approximately 40% share in overall
global compression, including approximately 70% in the North America residential HVAC segment, and strong
positions within our non-compression offerings.

Our large installed base of more than 150 million HVAC compressor units globally drives profitable
aftermarket sales due to replacement dynamics, with approximately 80% of our net sales tied to repair or
replacement activity. Ongoing technology leadership is a key driver of our ability to capitalize on the replacement
cycle, as each successive generation of compressor provides greater cost savings, energy efficiency and higher levels
of environmental sustainability impact.

The replacement cycle is primarily driven by repair and replacement of HVACR systems. Our installed
base provides a foundation for ongoing earnings resilience as systems age and require repair or replacement. Global
regulations around the impact of refrigerants on global warming and the need for energy efficiency amplify
replacement dynamics in our business. Globally, government programs and incentives support the adoption of new,
more sustainable products creating a strong forward looking growth environment. Secular trends tied to human
health and comfort, as well as food quality, safety and sustainability drive additional demand for our compression
and solutions offerings.

As the heart of an HVAC system, the compressor is the system’s most critical component, yet represents a
small percentage of the unit cost to the consumer. For example, approximately three to five percent of the residential
HVAC unit cost is associated with the compressor, but the compressor has a mission-critical impact on function and
efficiency. Compressors enable the separation of the low-pressure side of an HVAC system, where heat is absorbed
into the refrigerant, from the high-pressure side of the system, where heat is discharged from the refrigerant to a
cooling medium (typically the ambient outside air). The compressor mechanically reduces the volume of low-side
refrigerant, thereby increasing its pressure and enabling heated refrigerant to flow to the high-pressure side of the
system, where it is cooled.


-----

We offer a variety of compressor technologies to meet customer-specific applications. Compression
technology is essential to improving system efficiency. In addition, refrigerant selection is dependent on rigorous
testing by compressor manufacturers to evaluate for performance and reliability and approve for use. Globally, the
HVACR system manufacturers are dependent upon compressor innovation to meet regulations for efficiency and
more environmentally friendly refrigerants. Because compressors are highly engineered to meet our customers’
technical requirements, we work closely with them on ER&D efforts to develop technology that meets consumer
needs and complies with regulatory changes. These tightly coupled relationships result from our industry leadership
and help provide us with good forward-looking visibility to market needs and opportunities to differentiate
ourselves.

**Environmental Sustainability**

We believe compressors lie at the nexus of energy efficiency, helping build environmental sustainability
and playing a role in ESG-related trends. Environmental sustainability is inherently embedded in what we do, as we
enable our customers to set environmental sustainability goals and consistently meet or exceed ever-increasing
sustainability standards. The best compressors—the most energy efficient, the quietest, the most reliable—are also
the most environmentally sustainable and the most cost efficient for our OEM customers and the end users of their
products. Consistently improving energy efficiency and sustainability requires continued technological innovation
which is made possible by our extensive and proven ER&D capabilities.

**_Business Unit Overview_**

Our business is organized into two broad categories (HVACR Technologies and Electronics and Controls),
with three world areas included within the HVACR Technologies group (HVACR Americas, HVACR AMEA
(Asia, Middle-East and Africa) and HVACR Europe).

Further, for the last twelve months ended March 31, 2024, we generated net sales and Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA of $4,722.7 million and $1,361.0 million, respectively. See “Summary Historical Consolidated and
Combined Financial Information” for a reconciliation of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA to net earnings, the closest
comparable GAAP measure.

**NET SALES MIX[(1) ]**

(1) As of the last twelve months ended March 31, 2024.

**_HVACR Technologies_**

The businesses within our HVACR Technologies group are leading producers of compression and related
controls and solutions for residential, commercial, refrigeration, industrial, and transport markets. Our pioneering
leadership of the scroll type of compressor enables foundational leadership across a majority of our served markets.
To meet the diverse needs of other compressor applications, we also provide hermetic, semi-hermetic, centrifugal,
screw and reciprocating compressors. The depth and breadth of our portfolio is unmatched globally, allowing us to
steward market change and innovation across a wide range of market segments and applications. Our global
HVACR Technologies group generated 84% of our total net sales and 87% of our Adjusted EBITDA for the last
twelve months ended March 31, 2024.

**HVACR Americas is our largest business unit and operates within an environment where our scroll**
technology is extremely well-suited for applications across the served market. This business unit generated 57% of
our total net sales and 59% of our Adjusted EBITDA for the last twelve months ended March 31, 2024. Our leading
positions with the largest North American OEMs serving the residential, commercial and transportation segments is
augmented by our leadership with a more fragmented set of refrigeration and industrial customers. Above and
beyond the growth that an accelerated energy efficiency and low GWP refrigerant regulatory environment is driving
for our core residential, commercial and refrigeration markets, our industrial business is well-positioned for
sustainability-driven growth within the RNG segment. The industrial business is roughly divided 50/50 between
traditional industrial refrigeration applications and RNG applications. The RNG space is growing at a double-digit
compound annual growth rate the past few years and growth is expected to accelerate given sustainability trends and
the associated policies and incentives to deal with landfill and other off-gassing, largely farm-digestor applications.
We are well-positioned with key customers in this space, as well as with their solution providers and engineering
contractors. Broad heating, cooling and refrigeration needs across the Americas region coupled with a mature
regulatory environment provide a solid foundation for continued growth and innovation opportunities.

Our leadership in HVACR AMEA is driven by balanced sales between residential, commercial and
refrigeration applications. Our technology leadership in commercial, district and other heating and refrigeration
segments in China is complemented by our broad leadership positions in the rest of the region, including high
ambient temperature and residential applications in countries such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. HVACR AMEA
generated 18% of our net sales and 22% of our Adjusted EBITDA for the last twelve months ended March 31, 2024.

**HVACR Europe has historically been a strong commercial and refrigeration market and is now the fastest**
growing business unit as fossil-fueled boiler systems are being replaced by heat pump and dual fuel solutions,

-----

Comprising approximately 81% of our total net sales for the last twelve months ended March 31, 2024, our
HVACR market segments, including residential and commercial HVAC compression, refrigeration and related
aftermarket, and industrial, play an important role for our business (approximately 36% residential HVAC
compression, approximately 20% commercial HVAC compression, approximately 22% refrigeration and related
aftermarket, and approximately 4% industrial). In addition, for the three months ended March 31, 2024,
approximately 82% of our total net sales were generated from our HVACR compression market segment, consisting
of approximately 34% residential HVAC compression (representing a 15% decrease in year over year sales),
approximately 20% commercial HVAC compression (representing a 1% increase in year over year sales),
approximately 23% refrigeration and related aftermarket (representing a 5% increase in year over year sales), and
approximately 5% industrial (representing a 39% increase in year over year sales).

The compressor is the most critical device within the HVACR system, and the most energy-intensive
HVACR component. Each unit is engineered to meet application, segment, and customer requirements to efficiently
separate the evaporator low-pressure side of the system from the condenser high-pressure side. There are six
categories of compressor technology. We invented scroll technology and continue to innovate and scale this
technology platform. Scroll’s flexibility in modulation, superior efficiency and advantages in performance best
positions it to keep up with evolving industry technical requirements and to win share from other technology types.
While scroll is the leading technology for a majority of our served HVACR applications, certain applications are
better suited to other technologies. We have developed a full suite of technology options, including a new offering in
oil-free centrifugal, to meet a wide range of customer technology needs. Our leading portfolio across operating
parameters and served applications creates opportunities for us to leverage global ER&D efforts and to apply
learnings from one segment or region to other segments or regions thus driving productivity and improving our
ability to capture new opportunities in a timely fashion.

In addition to our compression solutions, our Electronics and Controls market segment (to be distinguished
from our Electronic and Controls business unit) generated approximately 19% of our total net sales for the last
twelve months ended March 31, 2024 and approximately 18% for the last three months ended March 31, 2024
(representing a 10% decrease in year over year sales). Our portfolio of “control” products includes perishable and
environmental monitoring solutions, control systems, thermostats, food safety instruments and software solutions.
These products support climate and energy management in residential and commercial buildings, as well as across
the cold chain.

**_Customers and Distribution Channels_**

Our customers include the world’s largest HVAC system OEMs and regional and local HVAC providers,
as well as distributors, wholesalers and end users. Through our market and technology leadership and global
production capacity, we have achieved significant share with leading OEMs who represent approximately one-third
of global sales. Our approximately 800 other customers account for the other two-thirds of global sales. These longtenured OEM relationships provide long-term volume stability, scale and influence. Our highly diversified customer
base helps minimize risks associated with customer concentration.

We tailor our go-to-market strategy across the value chain to best suit specific segments and end customers.
Approximately two-thirds of our products are sold directly to OEMs globally. OEM customers seek advantages in
efficiency, applied cost and compressor performance to reduce design complexity and improve performance. We
also sell our products directly to secondary buyers such as distributors and contractors. Our strong reputation for
product quality and durability, which reduce warranty costs for OEMs and the total long-term cost of ownership for
end customers, has pull-through effects on OEMs and the entire value chain. We further collaborate with channel
influencers, such as researchers, regulators, technical schools and utility providers, to create connectivity with the
entire HVACR ecosystem. In the food retail and food service industries, we work directly with end users as well as
the OEMs to provide solutions, which are sold either to the OEM, through intermediaries or directly to the end user.

We and our customers invest significant time and resources in designing products to meet required
specifications for each application and technology platform. As a result, we are highly integrated with our
customers, augmenting our strong market position. OEMs launch new product platforms every seven to ten years,
typically in connection with new regulatory standards. These new platforms require significant redesigns that need


-----

many years of product development and close alignment between the OEM and its compressor suppliers. This
dynamic inherently favors our company due to the long-standing, close working relationships between our
engineering teams and our key OEM customers. Between formal launches, platforms are continually modified to
reduce cost and improve efficiency and reliability. The redesign process is less significant and favors the original
compressor supplier on the OEM platform. In addition to our integration in the development cycle, we have built
channels and technical support structures with OEM partners, where they rely on us to provide aftermarket support
and continue to service the installed base. Our role as a trusted partner in customer design and manufacturing
processes has resulted in low customer turnover.

Our technological advantage, deeply integrated partnerships with OEM customers and strong quality
performance together make us indispensable to our customers and support our ability to maintain margins despite
rising input costs. LTAs include mechanisms to pass through material cost inflation in order to provide stability and
resiliency. On average, LTAs are three to four years in length and approximately one-third of our total net sales are
covered by LTAs.

**_Technology Leadership_**

The ongoing cycle of periodic new platform launches and subsequent updates provides us with line of sight
into future customer technology needs, enabling us to tailor our ER&D efforts around anticipated customer
demands. In doing so, we help OEMs keep pace with and shape technology innovations in the HVACR industry. We
have developed a robust and repeatable ER&D process to enable us to be a consistent innovation pioneer. Key
capabilities include: technology discovery and maturation; front-end innovation; world class laboratories and
ecosystems; specialized technical expertise; partnerships with universities, national labs and government agencies;
regulatory agency and industry leadership; and new product development support.

With more than 1,400 engineering and ER&D employees and approximately 500,000 square feet of
engineering labs at 12 major ER&D centers worldwide, including three in Asia and five in Europe, we have
substantial infrastructure to build on our technology leadership. Our ER&D strategy is further supported by the
development of the Helix, an industry-first space where stakeholders can innovate at a system or ecosystem level
around the industry’s biggest, most complex challenges. The Helix includes six simulated real-world, fully
functional environments allowing us to test and demonstrate our integrated solutions in real-world environments.
The Helix positions our company as a key thought leader and solutions provider in the HVACR industry.

**_Geographic and Manufacturing Footprint_**

We serve our customers through 27 global manufacturing facilities and 12 major global ER&D centers,
with a global headcount of approximately 18,000 employees. Global scale paired with localized manufacturing
enable us to think globally and act locally, creating a flexible and robust supply chain that is regionalized to provide
customers with a strong on-time delivery record. This advantage is derived not just from global operations, but also
from the breadth of our product offerings and our ability to meet customers’ requirements. Decades of research and
customer collaboration have ultimately yielded an unmatched global HVAC installed base of more than 150 million
units.

Our HVACR business is geographically focused in the Americas, where we generate approximately 70% of
total net sales, with AMEA and Europe generating approximately 20% and 11% of total net sales, respectively. As
the European business continues to grow at a pace faster than other regions due to heat pump and other application
opportunities, we will benefit from further diversification and greater global presence. Traditional European
compressor manufacturers do not have meaningful presence in residential applications, thus favoring our
competitive position as we help build out a heat pump infrastructure to replace fossil-fuel burning boiler systems.

Our continued global expansion into new regions with attractive market dynamics remains a priority and
will be actively supported by our existing global infrastructure and network.


-----

**Our Industry**

We participate in the HVACR compression and related solutions and controls markets with a focus on
residential, commercial, refrigeration, transportation, industrial and cold chain applications. We estimate that the
total annual sales in the market segments addressable by our current product offerings is approximately $13.4 billion
and such market is expected to grow at a compound annual rate of approximately 4% over the next five years.

Demand in our markets is supported by attractive macro drivers such as global regulation shifts, industrydriven sustainability goals and regulatory subsidies and incentives. Based on our current market positioning, our
global scale and flexibility of our supply chain, and our manufacturing and ER&D capabilities, we are wellpositioned to capitalize on these trends.

    - **Regulatory Changes: Regulatory changes have driven change and innovation in our industry for**
decades. However, the frequency and impact of those changes has increased in recent years. These
changes include updates to SEER requirements (and other global efficiency standards) and new
standards on refrigerants that drive more frequent compressor and system innovations. The complexity
resulting from these changes favors our global breadth and the depth of our engineering, technology
and operations. In the United States, new efficiency regulations went into effect January 1, 2023. In
2025, new refrigerant regulations will again drive new compressors and systems into the market.
Additional new regulations in the next seven to ten years are anticipated. Engineering and development
efforts typically begin years in advance of the applicable regulation effective date. Our OEM
customers depend on us to help them meet these requirements in a timely fashion while simultaneously
helping them innovate and differentiate to meet their sustainability goals. Europe’s sustainability goals
and their desire for energy sovereignty is driving goals and incentives targeting the installation of
30 million new heat pumps by 2030.

    - **Heat Pump Conversion: The growth of heat pumps is expected to bring new customers into the**
HVAC market, as households convert a furnace-only or gas-only system to a heat pump. According to
a major consulting practice, consumers enjoy on average approximately $4,000 in lifetime savings


-----

from heat pumps, supported by government subsidy programs and incentives available from utility
providers.

    - Conversion to heat pumps is expected to be particularly strong in Europe, where high natural gas
prices are incentivizing a transition to less energy-intensive heat pumps. The EU is in the process of
revising its EPBD to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030, a legal obligation under the
European climate law, and make the EU climate-neutral by 2050. While the revision is still under
negotiation, the EPBD is expected to require member states to ensure that all new buildings after 2027
are zero-emission, and set deadlines after which the use of fossil fuel heating systems in new buildings,
or in major building renovations or renovations of the heating systems, will not be permitted. Existing
regulations across nine European countries have already implemented, or will implement by 2026,
fossil fuel boiler bans in residential buildings. With the upcoming revision of the EPBD, we expect that
all other EU member states will implement similar restrictions and the scope will ultimately comprise
all existing buildings. Some countries also already provide, or are expected to provide, monetary
incentives to accelerate the transition to clean heating, including heat pumps. With strong channel
benefits and an existing customer base, the major legacy boilermakers are playing a critical role in the
heat pump transition. Our HVAC compression expertise positions us as an important partner as legacy
boilermakers help drive heat pump adoption. Our partnership and existing share with legacy
boilermakers and HVAC OEMs positions us well to enable this transition. We are currently a leader in
compression for the heat pump segment in Europe.

    - **COVID-19 / Hybrid Working: More waking hours spent at home are expected to maintain HVAC**
usage above pre-COVID-19 levels, shortening system useful life. According to a major consulting
practice, these new working arrangements are expected to keep replacement rates elevated as
approximately 45% of employees are predicted to be in hybrid working models in the future versus
approximately 10% pre-COVID-19. HVACR industry executives also expect replacement rates to
remain elevated. Run times in 2020 were quoted as being 30% higher than 2019 levels (after adjusting
for weather), which should correlate to higher rates of replacement over time.

    - **Environmental and Population Shifts: With environmental change resulting in more extreme**
temperatures across the United States, and a population mix increasingly shifting to warmer southern
states, HVAC usage has increased and is expected to continue to increase, resulting in shorter useful
lives for HVAC equipment and higher replacement rates.

**Our Key Strengths**

**_Established global leader with clear #1 market position_**

We are the #1 manufacturer of HVACR compression products in the segments and regions where we
compete, driven by technology leadership, strong brand recognition, global facilities footprint and long-term
customer relationships. We are the clear leader in terms of global scale and presence, as well as breadth and quality
of our product portfolio, and we compete against different peers in each segment and region where we operate. Our
size and scale enable operational synergies driven by our ability to leverage technology, ER&D and manufacturing
excellence across regions.

**_Unrivaled breadth and depth of product portfolio and capabilities executed through a global ER&D_**
**_supply network, and well-positioned for innovation_**

Our global manufacturing capabilities, paired with our leading portfolio of SKUs and patents, enable us to
provide what our customers need, where they need it, and when they need it. No competitor can match our global
reach across markets and segments. Our leading technology position is supported by more than 3,000 patents and
pending applications. Extensive ER&D capabilities in the United States and Asia, along with a growing ER&D
functionality in Europe, enable us to offer truly global ER&D capabilities to meet the needs of each individual
customer and application.


-----

These capabilities, combined with our deeply integrated relationships with leading OEMs and decades of
experience have made us an industry leader in technological advancement. We work collaboratively with regulators
to understand future efficiency capability standards and we are developing the solutions to meet those standards with
the world’s leading HVACR manufacturers. Leveraging these partnerships and our global ER&D infrastructure, we
are able to take a leadership position in shaping each wave of regulatory transition.

Our deep appreciation of the end user helps us tailor our technology to each customer’s needs, bringing our
global expertise to provide local solutions. This continued technological leadership has helped make us the most
trusted name in compressor solutions. Given our manufacturing presence and ER&D capabilities, we are wellpositioned for the industry’s transition to heat pumps.

Planned and anticipated regulatory changes governing efficiency and refrigerants are expected to provide
stable, ongoing tailwinds to both price and volume. New regulations from the U.S. Department of Energy went into
effect in 2023, with energy efficiency requirements varied by region, and OEM partners are relying on us to design
products that comply with the new regulations. The anticipated transition to low-GWP refrigerants in 2025 will
require considerable engineering, given that compliant refrigerants exhibit different characteristics from existing
refrigerants, such as operating pressures and flammability.

**_Mission critical partner to a diversified global customer base characterized by long-term relationships_**

As the heart of an HVAC system, the compressor is the system’s most critical component, yet represents a
small percentage of the unit cost to the consumer. For example, approximately three to five percent of the residential
HVAC unit cost is associated with the compressor, but the product has a mission-critical impact on function and
efficiency. Compression innovation can create performance, reliability and cost advantages to system design,
therefore enabling value-based selling. Customers will pay a premium for compressors that achieve superior levels
of efficiency, enabling them to reduce other costs within the system design and resulting in an overall lower total
applied system cost.

We and our customers invest significant time and resources in designing products to meet specifications
required by each application and technology platform. As a result, we are highly integrated with our customers,
augmenting our industry leadership and helping provide us with good forward-looking visibility to market needs and
opportunities to differentiate. LTAs further support revenue visibility and customer retention. Outside of the United
States, where the customer base is more diversified and fragmented, LTAs are utilized less frequently.

**_Highly engineered offering promotes customer retention through customer process integration_**

In addition to the critical nature of compressors within HVAC systems, we also serve as a critical
engineering, development, and manufacturing partner to our customers. We provide crucial services to our
customers at every stage of the product lifecycle by:

    - Helping customers develop specifications to meet new regulatory requirements

    - Innovating compressor technology to meet the requirements

    - Manufacturing units at scale and on time to support new platform launches

    - Developing updates to existing platforms in partnership with customers

    - Providing aftermarket products and services to help end-users realize the full useful lives of their
HVACR systems

Deep interconnectivity with our customers’ design and manufacturing processes helps us to provide bestin-class service and support to our customers. This deep integration incentivizes our customers to maintain their
relationships with us. Customer turnover is less than one percent historically. Our technical expertise and operational
support make us a trusted partner.


-----

**_Resilient business model supported by established installed base and high replacement volumes_**

Replacement as a percent of sales has increased to more than 85% over the last 50 years in the North
America residential HVAC industry, with a current installed base of approximately 100 million units. Replacement
sales are more resilient and are associated with durable spend, often outperforming GDP growth rates during
economic cycles. Both HVACR systems broadly and compressors specifically suffer from wear. Compressors may
be replaced to extend the life of an HVACR system. Full system replacement occurs when HVACR units are beyond
repair or when an end-user determines that the payback in higher efficiency, lower emissions and better reliability is
sufficient to warrant the cost of replacement. Repair or replacement of a unit is non-discretionary because HVACR
systems provide essential heating, cooling and refrigeration.

Our resilient recovery during the 2007-2008 Global Financial Crisis speaks to the largely non-discretionary
nature of HVAC repair and replacement. Despite an approximately 15% revenue contraction in 2009, our revenues
rebounded quickly in 2010 with more than 19% growth before returning to normalized long-term growth rates. Over
the same period, we delivered improvements in gross margin and EBITDA margin as we moved quickly to manage
costs. Our cost structure is largely variable, enabling us to preserve margin during downturns such as the 2007-2008
Global Financial Crisis, the U.S. manufacturing downturn, and the COVID-19 pandemic.

Secular industry tailwinds, including upcoming regulatory changes, heat pump conversion, shifts in
population and the impact of hybrid working, are expected to drive an increase in HVAC usage. This increase in
usage can create more wear on HVAC systems and shorten systems’ useful lives, resulting in increased repair and
replacement rates and driving further demand for replacement products supporting our long-term resilient growth.

**_Proven leadership team with an unmatched breadth of experience_**

Our business is led by a highly qualified and experienced management team. Our management consistently
delivered value to stakeholders while operating as a standalone segment of Emerson. In partnership with Blackstone,
the Copeland team continues to drive innovation and execute on operational excellence in order to capitalize on
strong industry tailwinds.

**_Strong financial profile with best-in-class profitability and free cash flow generation, poised for margin_**
**_expansion through identified efficiency opportunities_**

We have delivered robust and consistent through-the-cycle cash flow performance and top-line growth,
supported by secular industry tailwinds, technology leadership, embedded relationships with customers, and the
mission-critical nature of our product offerings.


-----

**Competition**

We operate in highly competitive markets. We compete based on product performance, quality, delivery,
branding, service, total applied cost and/or price across the industries and markets served. A significant element of
our competitive strategy is to deliver solutions to our customers by manufacturing high-quality products at the best
applied cost. Although no single company competes directly with us in all of our product lines, various companies
compete in one or more product lines with the number of competitors varying by product line. Some competitors
have substantially greater sales, assets and financial resources than our business and we also compete with many
smaller companies. We believe we have a market leadership position in many of our product lines.

**Intellectual Property**

We maintain an intellectual property portfolio we have developed or acquired over a number of years,
including patents, trademarks and licenses. We also continue to develop or acquire new intellectual property. New
patent applications are continuously filed to protect our ongoing research and development activities and we
periodically review the continued utility of patent assets. Our trademark registrations may be renewed and their
duration is dependent upon national laws and trademark use. While this proprietary intellectual property portfolio is
important to our business in the aggregate, we do not regard our business as being dependent on any single patent,
trademark registration or license.

We believe that we have taken all necessary steps to protect our intellectual property rights, but no
assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully enforce or protect our rights in the event that they are
infringed upon by a third-party.

**Government Regulation**

We are subject to a number of U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations that affect
manufacturing companies. Many of these laws and regulations are still evolving and being tested in courts. These
involve HVACR efficiency and refrigeration requirements, the environment, labor and employment, health and
safety, intellectual property, data privacy and security, advertising, marketing, competition, consumer protection,
taxation, economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions and securities law compliance.

_Environmental Regulation_

Our operations, products and services are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, including
obligations to obtain and comply with permits required for the operation of our business and to meet applicable
safety or stewardship standards. Our manufacturing locations generate wastes (including hazardous wastes), of
which use, handling, storage, treatment, transportation, discharge and disposal are subject to U.S. federal, state,
foreign and/or local laws and regulations relating to pollution, public and worker health and safety and protection of
the environment. We strive to minimize the environmental impact of our operations through pollution control
technologies, facility design and operating procedures. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations has not
had, and based on currently available information and the applicable laws and regulations currently in effect, is not
expected to have a material effect on our capital expenditures (including expenditures for pollution control
equipment), earnings or competitive position. However, environmental requirements have and are expected to
continue to become increasingly stringent, and environmental laws and regulations may be changed, accelerated or
adopted that impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon us and which could
negatively impact our operating results.

In addition, we are also subject to obligations under federal and state environmental laws to complete
investigations and remediation at several of our current and former operating locations as well as having been
assessed a share of responsibility for remedial activities at certain third-party disposal (i.e., “Superfund”) sites.
Based on our information regarding the nature and volume of wastes allegedly disposed of or released at these
properties, the total estimated cleanup costs and other financially viable potentially responsible parties, we do not
believe the costs to us associated with these properties will be material, either individually or in the aggregate. As of


-----

September 30, 2023, financial reserves of $16.6 million have been established for the reasonably estimable costs of
such matters.

_Employee Health and Safety Regulations_

We are subject to requirements relating to safe working conditions and manufacturing practices, including
in the United States federal and state Occupational Safety and Health (OSHA) standards and regulations. Employee
health and safety in the workplace is one of our core values. The Climate Technologies leadership team will
continue to support our employees with training, policies and other resources to provide a safe and healthy
workplace. Hazards in the workplace are actively identified, and incident tracking is implemented, so that
preventative and remedial actions can be taken to maintain and improve workplace safety.

**Employees and Human Capital**

We are dedicated to modernizing our workplace culture with the goal of meeting the needs and
expectations of today’s workers and attract talent that will help us thrive. We believe our success depends on our
ability to attract, develop and retain key personnel. The skills, experience and industry knowledge of key employees
significantly benefit our operations and performance. We develop our employees and future leaders internally with
programs that focus on business development, managerial skills, inclusion and employee engagement.

We support and develop our employees through global training and development programs that build and
strengthen employees’ leadership and professional skills. Leadership development programs include intensive
learning programs for new leaders as well as more established leaders. We also partner with educational institutions
and nonprofit organizations to help prepare current and future workers with knowledge and skills to succeed. To
assess and improve employee retention and engagement, we survey employees with the assistance of third-party
consultants, and take actions to address areas of employee concern.

We have identified other human capital priorities, including, among other things, providing competitive
wages and benefits and promoting an inclusive work environment. We are focused on efforts to elevate the
representation of women and U.S. minorities and foster an inclusive work environment that supports our large
global workforce and helps us innovate for our customers. Employee resource groups have been created to support
our diverse workforce. We also have taken actions with the goal of enhancing diversity, including setting diversity
targets for interview slates and recruiting at venues representing women, minorities, U.S. military veterans, and
LGBTQ+ talent.

Employee levels are managed to align with the pace of our business and management believes it has
sufficient human capital to operate its business successfully. We have approximately 17,800 employees located
around the world. Management believes that our employee relations are favorable.

A small portion of our U.S. employees are unionized, and outside the U.S., we have employees in certain
countries, particularly in Europe, that are represented by an employee representative organization, such as a union,
works council or employee association.

**Legal Proceedings**

We are subject to various litigations, claims and other proceedings that arise from time to time in the
ordinary course of business. We believe these actions are routine and incidental to the business. While the outcome
of these actions cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that any will have a material adverse impact on
our business.

**CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS**

**JV NewCo Governance Documents**

In connection with the closing of the Acquisition (the “Closing”), (i) JV NewCo entered into an amended
and restated limited partnership agreement (the “JV NewCo LPA”) with its general partner, Emerald GP Holdings
G.P. LLC (“JV NewCo GP”), BCP Emerald and certain wholly owned holding company subsidiaries of Emerson,
and (ii) JV NewCo GP entered into an amended and restated limited liability company agreement (the “JV NewCo
GP LLCA” and, together with the JV NewCo LPA, the “Governance Documents”) with BCP Emerald and certain
wholly owned holding company subsidiaries of Emerson. Capitalized terms used in this section and not defined
herein have the meanings set forth in the JV NewCo LPA and the JV NewCo GP LLCA, as applicable. Upon the
closing of the Unit Purchase Transaction, Emerson’s rights under the Governance Documents will terminate (other
than in respect of certain indemnification and confidentiality obligations) and the Governance Documents will be
amended and restated to reflect such termination of rights.

Pursuant to the Governance Documents:

_Board Rights. JV NewCo is governed by the board of managers of JV NewCo GP (the “JV NewCo GP_
Board”), which will be comprised of up to ten managers and currently consists of three managers appointed by BCP
Emerald, two managers to be appointed by Emerson, the CEO of JV NewCo (who will be a non-voting manager),
and three independent managers appointed by BCP Emerald in consultation with Emerson. Each of BCP Emerald
and Emerson have the right to appoint up to three non-voting board observers. The rights of BCP Emerald and
Emerson to appoint managers to the JV NewCo GP Board (and the number of votes each manager may cast) are
subject to agreed step-downs in connection with transfers of their equity interests in JV NewCo (provided that each
will have the right to appoint at least one manager if they own more than 10% of JV NewCo). Actions of the JV
NewCo GP Board require consent of the managers holding a majority of the votes. The managers appointed by BCP
Emerald hold a majority of the votes of the JV NewCo GP Board, and such votes are controlled by the BCP Emerald
managers who are investment professionals of Blackstone.

_Consent Rights. Each of BCP Emerald and Emerson have consent rights over certain fundamental matters_
including, without limitation, related party transactions, any acquisition or disposition of assets or stock with a
purchase price in excess of $1 billion, and any incurrence of indebtedness that would exceed a certain specified pro
forma leverage ratio. The consent rights are subject to certain fall-away provisions.

_Transfer and Liquidity Rights._

Emerson will not be able to transfer any interest in JV NewCo, subject to certain exceptions, including
transfers (i) to certain affiliates, (ii) in an IPO or a change of control sale, (iii) following an IPO (subject to certain
restrictions discussed below), (iv) with the approval of the JV NewCo GP Board prior to the second anniversary of
the Closing, (v) subject to BCP Emerald’s “tag-along” rights, in an amount not to exceed 50% and 100% of its
interests in JV NewCo after the second and fifth anniversaries of the Closing, respectively (provided that Emerson
may not sell its interests to a competitor or activist investor), or (vi) pursuant to the exercise of Emerson’s customary
“tag-along” rights or in a change of control sale. Transfers by Emerson are generally subject to a “right of first offer”
by BCP Emerald over the interests proposed to be transferred.

BCP Emerald generally has the right to transfer any interest in JV NewCo, however, Emerson has
customary “tag-along” rights (as mentioned above) unless such transfer is (i) pursuant to customary permitted
transfer provisions, including to certain affiliates, (ii) in an IPO or a change of control sale, or (iii) in connection
with a syndication of BCP Emerald’s equity within six months of closing, subject to certain parameters. BCP
Emerald will also have the ability to force a change of control sale of JV NewCo; however, before the second
anniversary of the Closing, any such sale must generate an agreed upon return.

Emerson shall have the right to require JV NewCo to consummate a Qualified IPO after the fifth
anniversary of the Closing and BCP Emerald shall have the right to require JV NewCo to consummate a Qualified
IPO after the second anniversary of the Closing. Each of Emerson and BCP Emerald shall have the right to require


-----

JV NewCo to consummate a Non-Qualified IPO after the seventh anniversary of the Closing. If Emerson makes a
demand for JV NewCo to consummate an IPO (whether a Qualified IPO or a Non-Qualified IPO), BCP Emerald
shall have a right of first offer to purchase all of the common equity that Emerson owns. Certain volume-related
transfer restrictions will apply to Emerson in and following an IPO of JV NewCo, through a priority sell-down right
granted to BCP Emerald, until BCP Emerald has received an agreed amount of sale proceeds.

_Preemptive rights. Before an IPO, each party has preemptive rights with respect to any issuance of equity_
interests or debt securities in JV NewCo (subject to certain exceptions).

_Non-Compete. Until 24 months after Emerson’s ownership interest in JV NewCo falls below 10%,_
Emerson will not, directly or indirectly, engage in, or have an interest in, manage, control or provide financing to,
any business that competes with the Climate Technologies Business as conducted at the time of the Closing.
Exceptions to this non-compete are (i) acquisitions of a diversified business having not more than 10% of its sales
attributable to any competing business (or, if such sales exceed the 10% threshold, Emerson must divest below such
threshold within 12 months of such acquisition) and (ii) ownership of less than 5% of the equity interests of any
person engaged in a competing business.

_Non-Solicit and Non-Hire. Until 24 months after Emerson’s ownership interest in JV NewCo falls below_
10%, Emerson and JV NewCo may not solicit the following employees of the other: (i) executive or managerial
employees; and (ii) employees engaged in the provision of services to the other under the Transition Services
Agreement (discussed further below) in a senior, technical or managerial role, in each case of (i) and (ii), subject to
certain customary exceptions.

**Agreements with Management**

In connection with the Acquisition, we created two new incentive plans for our employees’ performance
and retention purposes, the Emerald JV Holdings L.P. 2023 Unit Incentive Plan and the Long-Term Incentive Plan.
Certain members of management and other employees participate in such plans.

We also have entered into new employment agreements with certain members of our management.

**Transition Services Agreement**

In connection with the Acquisition, Emerson and JV NewCo entered into a Transition Services Agreement
pursuant to which, following the Closing, each party provides the other party with various specified services on a
transitional basis at pre-agreed costs, consisting of the services provided between Emerson and the Climate
Technologies Business.

**Services Agreement**

In connection with the Closing, JV NewCo entered into a services agreement with Blackstone Management
Partners L.L.C. and Blackstone Capital Partners VIII L.P. (collectively, “BX Management”). Under the services
agreement, JV NewCo pays or reimburses BX Management and their affiliates for out-of-pocket costs and expenses
incurred on behalf of or in connection with the monitoring and evaluation of the operations of JV NewCo. JV
NewCo also indemnifies each of BX Management and certain of its related persons against, among other things,
losses and liabilities incurred in connection with or as a result of the services provided to JV NewCo or its affiliates
pursuant to the services agreement.

**Convertible PIK Preferred Equity**

In connection with the Closing, JV NewCo issued $2 billion aggregate initial liquidation preference of
shares of Convertible PIK Preferred Equity to BCP Emerald. The Convertible PIK Preferred Equity rank senior in
rights upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of JV NewCo to common stock and any other class or series of
equity securities of JV NewCo not specifically ranked senior to or pari passu with the Convertible PIK Preferred


-----

Equity. The Convertible PIK Preferred Equity is structurally subordinate to the Seller Notes and the third-party debt
financing.

In lieu of dividends, the initial aggregate liquidation preference of the Convertible PIK Preferred Equity
accretes daily, compounding semi-annually, at a rate equal to 7% per annum.

The Convertible PIK Preferred Equity is non-voting, except that approval of the holders of a majority of the
Convertible PIK Preferred Equity, voting as a separate class, is required for certain matters relating to the terms of
the Convertible PIK Preferred Equity, the issuance of equity securities ranking senior to or pari passu with the
Convertible PIK Preferred Equity, and certain reorganization transactions involving JV NewCo.

The Convertible PIK Preferred Equity is mandatorily convertible upon a Qualified IPO (as defined in the
JV NewCo GP LLCA) by JV NewCo or upon a Change of Control (as defined in the JV NewCo LPA) of JV
NewCo.

In an IPO, if the price per share of common stock sold in such IPO is greater than a 10% premium above
the common equity purchase price at the Closing, the Convertible PIK Preferred Equity will automatically convert
into common shares of the IPO Corporation. Otherwise, the Convertible PIK Preferred Equity will convert into a
cash-pay preferred instrument (the “Cash-Pay Preferred Equity”) paying dividends at a 9% annual rate. The CashPay Preferred Equity remains convertible into common stock up to the accreted amount of the Convertible PIK
Preferred Equity. If the Seller Notes remain outstanding after a Non-Qualified IPO, dividends on the Cash-Pay
Preferred Equity compound at a 9% rate, but are not paid until the Seller Notes are repaid in full.

BCP Emerald generally has the right to transfer the Convertible PIK Preferred Equity, however, Emerson
will have customary “tag-along” rights in certain circumstances (as discussed above).

**Seller Notes**

In connection with the Closing, the Seller Notes Issuer issued two senior unsecured notes in aggregate
principal amount of $2.25 billion to an affiliate of Emerson. Pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement, the Seller
Notes Issuer will repurchase the Seller Notes issued to EMR Holdings. For a description of the Seller Notes and the
Seller Notes Repurchase, see “Description of Certain Other Indebtedness—Seller Notes” and “Summary—The
Transactions—Seller Notes Repurchase.”

**Corporate Campus Lease**

In connection with the Closing, that certain property located at 8000 and 8100 W. Florissant St. Louis,
Missouri (the “Corporate Campus”) was transferred by Emerson to a subsidiary of Emerson, which was, in turn,
transferred to a subsidiary of JV NewCo prior to the Closing. Beginning at the Closing, a portion of the Corporate
Campus has been leased from such subsidiary of JV NewCo, as landlord, to Emerson, as tenant (the “Campus
Lease”).

The Campus Lease has a term of three years (subject to certain extension rights). The base rent payable
under the Campus Lease is set at a rate per square foot of the Rentable Area (as defined in the Campus Lease). The
tenant under the Campus Lease is obligated to pay as additional rent its proportionate share of all real estate taxes,
insurance premiums, utility costs, repair and maintenance expenses and costs for ordinary capital improvements.

**Procedures with Respect to Review and Approval of Related Person Transactions**

From time to time, we may do business with certain companies affiliated with one or more members of the
Investor Group or Emerson. The JV NewCo GP Board has not adopted a formal written policy for the review and
approval of transactions with related persons. However, the JV NewCo GP Board expects to review and approve
transactions with related persons as appropriate. In addition, a noted above, JV NewCo must obtain the consent of
BCP Emerald and Emerson, as applicable, in connection with entry into certain related party transactions (subject to
certain exceptions).

indebtedness, including secured indebtedness.

**Term Loan B Facility**

In connection with the Acquisition, we entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) governing
the Term Loan Facilities, with Royal Bank of Canada as administrative agent and collateral agent. The Credit
Agreement initially provided for (a) the Term Loan B Facility in an aggregate principal amount of $2,275.0 million
(the “Original Term Loan B Facility”) and (b) the Term Loan A Facility in an aggregate principal amount of $450.0
million. On February 6, 2024 the Original Term Loan B was refinanced and replaced with new term B loans (the
“Refinanced Term Loan B Facility”) in an aggregate principal amount of $1,519.3 million.

The Borrower is the borrower under the Term Loan Facilities. Our Credit Agreement provides that we have
the right at any time, subject to customary conditions, to request incremental term loans or incremental revolving
commitments in an aggregate principal amount of up to (a) the greater of (1) $1,400 million and (2) an amount equal
to 100% of our trailing consolidated EBITDA for the most recently ended period of four consecutive fiscal quarters
for which financial statements are internally available, on a pro forma basis, plus (b) additional amounts not to
exceed available capacity under a specified general debt basket, plus (c) an amount equal to all voluntary
prepayments, repurchases and redemptions of the term loans under our Credit Agreement and certain other debt
secured by liens on the collateral and permanent revolving credit commitment reductions under our Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement and any other revolving credit facilities secured by liens on the Collateral, in each case
prior to or simultaneous with the date of any such incurrence (to the extent not funded with the proceeds of longterm debt other than revolving loans), plus (d) an additional unlimited amount so long as we (I) in the case of
incremental indebtedness that is secured by the collateral on an equal priority basis (without giving effect to the
control of remedies) with the Term Loan Facilities, do not exceed a specified pro forma first lien net leverage ratio
(or, so long as we do not exceed the pro forma first lien net leverage ratio immediately prior to such incurrence or
any related transactions), (II) in the case of incremental indebtedness that is secured on the collateral on a junior lien
basis with respect to the Term Loan Facilities, do not exceed a specified pro forma secured net leverage ratio (or, so


-----

long as we do not exceed the pro forma secured net leverage ratio immediately prior to such incurrence or any
related transactions) and (III) in the case of unsecured incremental indebtedness (or indebtedness secured by assets
that do not constitute collateral securing the Term Loan Facilities), either do not exceed a specified pro forma total
net leverage ratio or we satisfy a specified pro forma interest coverage ratio (or, so long as we do not exceed the pro
forma total net leverage ratio or we satisfy such interest coverage ratio, as applicable, immediately prior to such
incurrence or any related transactions). The lenders under the Term Loan Facilities are not under any obligation to
provide any such incremental loans or commitments, and any such addition of or increase in loans is subject to
certain customary conditions precedent and other provisions.

and (3) Term SOFR for a one month interest period plus 1.00% or (b) a Term SOFR rate determined by reference to
the applicable Term SOFR rate published on the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Website for the interest

Facility bear interest, at the Borrower’s option, at a rate per annum equal to an applicable margin over either (a) a
base rate determined by reference to the highest of (1) the “Prime Rate” in the United States as published in The
Wall Street Journal, (2) the federal funds effective rate plus 1/2 of 1% and (3) Term SOFR for a one month interest
period plus 1.00% or (b) a Term SOFR rate determined by reference to the applicable Term SOFR rate published on
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Website for the interest period relevant to such borrowing, subject to a
Term SOFR floor of 0.00%.

**_Prepayments_**

The Term Loan B Facility contains customary mandatory prepayment requirements, including with respect
to excess cash flow, asset sale proceeds and proceeds from certain incurrences of indebtedness. The Term Loan A
Facility contains customary mandatory prepayment requirements, including with respect to asset sale proceeds and
proceeds from certain incurrences of indebtedness, but do not contain a mandatory prepayment requirement with
respect to excess cash flow.

We may voluntarily repay outstanding loans under either Term Loan Facility at any time without premium
or penalty.

**_Amortization and maturity_**

Commencing with the second full fiscal quarter following the closing of the Term Loan B Facility, the term
loans under the Term Loan B Facility amortize in equal quarterly installments in an aggregate annual amount equal
to 1.00% of the original principal amount of such term loans, with the balance being payable on the date that is
seven years after the closing of the Term Loan B Facility.

The term loans under the Term Loan A Facility amortize in quarterly installments, which amortization
commenced with the first full fiscal quarter following the closing of the Term Loan A Facility, in a quarterly amount
equal to (i) from the first full fiscal quarter following the Closing through the eighth full fiscal quarter following the
closing of the Term Loan A Facility, 0%, (ii) from the ninth full fiscal quarter following the closing of the Term
Loan A Facility through the sixteenth full fiscal quarter following the closing of the Term Loan A Facility, 0.625%,
and (iii) from the seventeenth full fiscal quarter following the closing of the Term Loan A Facility until the maturity
date of the Term Loan A Facility, 1.875%, in each case of the original principal amount of the Term Loan A Facility
and with the balance being payable on the date that is five years after the closing of the Term Loan A Facility.

**_Guarantee and security_**

All of our obligations under the Term Loan Facilities and certain hedge agreements and cash management
arrangements provided by any lender party to the Term Loan Facilities or any of its affiliates and certain other


-----

persons are unconditionally guaranteed by Holdings, the Borrower (with respect to hedge agreements and cash
management arrangements not entered into by the Borrower) and each of our existing and subsequently acquired or
organized direct or indirect material wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries, with customary exceptions
including, among other things, where providing such guarantees is not permitted by law, regulation or contract or
would result in material adverse tax consequences.

All obligations under the Term Loan Facilities and certain hedge agreements and cash management
arrangements provided by any lender party to any Term Loan Facilities or any of its affiliates and certain other
persons, and the guarantees of such obligations, are secured, subject to permitted liens and other exceptions, by: (i) a
perfected first-priority pledge of all the equity interests of the Borrower and each wholly-owned material restricted
subsidiary of the Borrower that is directly held by the Borrower or a subsidiary guarantor (limited, with respect to
equity interests, to 65% of the voting power issued by first-tier foreign subsidiaries, CFCs or FSHCOs, as defined
under the Credit Agreement except that in certain instances, until the completion of certain post-closing entity
restructurings, all of the equity interests issued by a first-tier foreign subsidiary will be pledged), (ii) a perfected
first-priority security interests in substantially all tangible and intangible personal property of the Borrower and the
subsidiary guarantors (other than ABL Priority Collateral, in respect of which such obligations will be secured by a
perfected second-priority security interest).

**_Certain covenants and events of default_**

The Term Loan Facilities contain a number of covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to
certain exceptions, our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to:

    - incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness;

    - create or incur liens;

    - engage in mergers or consolidations;

    - sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of assets;

    - pay dividends and distributions or repurchase capital stock;

    - prepay, redeem or repurchase certain subordinated indebtedness;

    - make investments, loans and advances;

    - enter into certain transactions with affiliates;

    - enter into agreements that prohibit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to incur liens
on assets; and

    - enter into amendments to certain subordinated indebtedness in a manner materially adverse to the
lenders under the Term Loan Facilities.

The Term Loan Facilities will also limit Holdings’ activities to being a passive holding company until the
consummation of a qualified IPO and contain certain customary affirmative covenants and events of default for
facilities of this type, including relating to a change of control. If an event of default occurs, the lenders under each
Term Loan Facility will be entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due under the
applicable Term Loan Facility and all actions permitted to be taken by secured creditors under applicable law.

The Term Loan A Facility also contains a financial maintenance covenant requiring compliance with a first
lien leverage ratio not to exceed 7.50:1.00. The financial covenant is tested on the last day of each fiscal quarter
(commencing with the second full fiscal quarter after the closing of the Term Loan A Facility).


-----

**New Term Loan B Facility**

Prior to or concurrently with the consummation of the Seller Notes Repurchase, we expect to fund an
incremental Term Loan B Facility in an aggregate principal amount of $950.0 million (the “New Term Loan B
Facility”). The New Term Loan B Facility will have identical terms to the existing Term Loan B Facility provided,
however, that we expect that (a) the applicable margin with respect to the interest rates under the New Term Loan B
Facility may differ from the applicable margin with respect to the interest rates under the Term Loan B Facility, (b)
any voluntary prepayment, refinancing or repricing of the term loans under the New Term Loan B Facility in
connection with certain repricing transactions that occur on or prior to the six-month anniversary of the closing of
the New Term Loan B Facility shall be subject to a prepayment premium of 1.00% of the principal amount of the
term loans so prepaid, refinanced or repriced, subject to certain exceptions and (c) the New Term Loan B Facility
will mature 7 years from the date of the consummation of the Seller Notes Repurchase.

**Revolving Credit Facility**

In connection with the Acquisition, we entered into an asset-based revolving credit facility credit agreement
(the “ABL Credit Agreement”) that governs the Revolving Credit Facility, with Wells Fargo Bank, National
Association, as administrative agent and collateral agent, and some of the initial purchasers and certain of their
affiliates participated as lenders. The ABL Credit Agreement provides the Borrower with capacity for asset-based
revolving loans in an aggregate principal amount up to $700.0 million, subject to borrowing base capacity. The
Revolving Credit Facility also includes a sub-facility for letters of credit.

**_Incremental Capacity_**

In addition, the ABL Credit Agreement provides that we will have the right at any time, subject to
customary conditions, to request to increase the commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility by an aggregate
principal amount of up to the sum of (a) $175 million, (b) the amount of voluntary prepayments that are
accompanied permanent revolving credit commitment reductions under the ABL Credit Agreement prior to or
simultaneous with the date of any such incurrence and (c) capacity under the Borrowing Base (as defined in the
ABL Credit Agreement) in excess of the commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility at the time of such
incurrence. The lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility are not be under any obligation to provide any such
incremental commitments, and any such addition of or increase in commitments is subject to certain customary
conditions precedent and other provisions.

**_Interest rate and fees_**

Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest, at the Borrower’s option, at a rate per annum
equal to an applicable margin over either (a) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (1) the “Prime
Rate” in the United States as published in The Wall Street Journal, (2) the federal funds effective rate plus 1/2 of 1%
and (3) Term SOFR for a one month interest period plus 1.00% or (b) a Term SOFR rate determined by reference to
the applicable Term SOFR rate published on the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Website for the interest
period relevant to such borrowing, subject to a Term SOFR floor of 0.00%.

**_Prepayments_**

The ABL Credit Agreement contains a mandatory prepayment requirement if at any time the amount of
outstanding loans and letters of credit issued thereunder exceed the aggregate commitments under the Revolving
Credit Facility or the Borrowing Base (as defined in the ABL Credit Agreement) in effect at such time.

We may voluntarily repay outstanding loans under the Revolving Credit Facility at any time without
premium or penalty, other than customary breakage costs with respect to LIBO rate loans.


-----

**_Amortization and maturity_**

The Revolving Credit Facility matures five years after the closing of the ABL Credit Agreement. Loans
under the Revolving Credit Facility do not amortize.

**_Guarantee and security_**

All of our obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedge agreements and cash
management arrangements provided by any lender party to the Revolving Credit Facility or any of its affiliates and
certain other persons are unconditionally guaranteed by Holdings, the Borrower (with respect to hedge agreements
and cash management arrangements not entered into by the Borrower) and each of our existing and subsequently
acquired or organized direct or indirect material wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries, with customary
exceptions including, among other things, where providing such guarantees is not permitted by law, regulation or
contract or would result in material adverse tax consequences.

All obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedge agreements and cash management
arrangements provided by any lender party to the Revolving Credit Facility or any of its affiliates and certain other
persons, and the guarantees of such obligations, are secured, subject to permitted liens and other exceptions, by: (i) a
perfected second-priority pledge of all the equity interests of the Borrower and each wholly-owned material
restricted subsidiary of the Borrower that is directly held by the Borrower or a subsidiary guarantor (limited, with
respect to equity interests, to 65% of the voting power issued by first-tier foreign subsidiaries, CFCs or FSHCOs, as
defined under each Credit Agreement) and (ii) a perfected second-priority security interests in substantially all
tangible and intangible personal property of the Borrower and the subsidiary guarantors; provided, that the
Revolving Credit Facility is secured by a first-priority security interest in all ABL Priority Collateral.

**_Certain covenants and events of default_**

The Revolving Credit Facility contains a number of covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to
certain exceptions, our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to:

    - incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness;

    - create or incur liens;

    - engage in mergers or consolidations;

    - sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of assets;

    - pay dividends and distributions or repurchase capital stock;

    - prepay, redeem or repurchase certain subordinated indebtedness;

    - make investments, loans and advances;

    - enter into certain transactions with affiliates;

    - enter into agreements that prohibit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to incur liens
on assets; and

    - enter into amendments to certain subordinated indebtedness in a manner materially adverse to the
lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility.

The Revolving Credit Facility contains a springing financial covenant requiring compliance with a fixed
charge coverage ratio of at least 1.0 to 1.0. The financial covenant is tested on the last day of any fiscal quarter only


-----

if excess availability under the Revolving Credit Facility is less than the greater of $40 million and 10% of the lesser
of aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Borrowing Base (as defined in the ABL
Credit Agreement). The Revolving Credit Facility also limits Holdings’ activities to being a passive holding
company until the consummation of a qualified IPO and will also contain certain customary affirmative covenants
and events of default for facilities of this type, including relating to a change of control. If an event of default occurs,
the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility are entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of
amounts due under the Revolving Credit Facility and all actions permitted to be taken by secured creditors under
applicable law.

**Seller Notes**

In connection with the Closing, the Seller Notes Issuer issued two senior unsecured notes in aggregate
principal amount of $2.25 billion to Emerson and/or one or more of its subsidiaries. The Seller Notes accrue interest
at a rate equal to 5% per annum, paid-in-kind, compounded semi-annually.

The Seller Notes are unsecured, structurally senior to the Convertible PIK Preferred Equity and are
structurally subordinated to the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Existing Notes and the notes offered hereby.
The Seller Notes mature on the tenth anniversary of the Closing and do not amortize.

Upon a Change of Control of the Seller Notes Issuer (as defined in a manner consistent with the Senior
Secured Credit Facilities, and to include (i) any sale, directly or indirectly, of all or substantially all of the assets of
the Seller Notes Issuer and its subsidiaries and (ii) the Seller Notes Issuer ceasing to own, directly or indirectly,
100% of the equity interests of the Issuer), the entire principal amount of the Seller Notes must be repaid in full in
cash, together with any accrued and unpaid interest.

The Seller Notes contain limited affirmative covenants such as (i) the delivery of financial statements and
financial information of the Issuer, (ii) payment of taxes, (iii) preservation of existence and (iv) compliance with
laws. They also contain limited negative covenants such as (i) not permitting the Seller Note Issuer or any
Intermediate Holding Company (as defined in the Transaction Agreement, to be any subsidiary of the Seller Notes
Issuer that directly or indirectly holds any equity interests of the Issuer) to incur any indebtedness or liens (other
than permitted liens); provided that any direct parent of the Issuer will be permitted to provide guarantees and grant
liens on its assets pursuant to the Opco Credit Documentation (as defined in the Transaction Agreement), (ii)
prohibiting dividends or distributions on the account of the Seller Note Issuer’s equity or any of its direct or indirect
parent company’s equity and (iii) prohibiting non-pro rata dividends or distributions on the equity of any of the
Seller Note Issuer’s subsidiaries that are not subject to the Opco Credit Documentation, among other limited
negative covenants, and the Seller Notes do not contain any cross defaults to other indebtedness.

**DESCRIPTION OF NOTES**

**General**

Certain terms used in this description are defined under the subheading “—Certain Definitions.” In this
description, (1) the term “Issuer” refers to EMRLD Borrower LP, a Delaware limited partnership, and not any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates; (2) the term “Co-Issuer” refers to Emerald Co-Issuer Inc., a Delaware corporation and a
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Issuer, and not any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates; (3) the term “Issuers” refers to
the Issuer and the Co-Issuer, collectively, and (4) the term “Holdings” refers to EMRLD Guarantor LP, a Delaware
limited partnership, and the direct parent company of the Issuer, and not to any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates; and
(5) the terms “we,” “our” and “us” each refer to the Issuer and its consolidated Subsidiaries.

The Issuers will issue $950.0 million aggregate principal amount of      % senior secured notes due 2031
(the “Notes”) under an indenture to be dated as of the Issue Date (as amended and supplemented from time to time,
the “Indenture”) among the Issuers, the Guarantors and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee
(in such capacity, the “Trustee”), collateral agent (in such capacity, the “Notes Collateral Agent”), registrar (in such
capacity, the “Registrar”), the Paying Agent (as defined herein), and transfer agent (in such capacity, the “Transfer
**_Agent”), The Notes will be issued in a private transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements of the_**
Securities Act. See “Transfer Restrictions.” The Issuers will not be required to, nor do they currently intend to, offer
to exchange the Notes for notes registered under the Securities Act or otherwise register or qualify by prospectus the
Notes for resale under the Securities Act. The Indenture will not be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act or
subject to the terms of the Trust Indenture Act. Accordingly, the terms of the Notes include only those stated in the
Indenture. The Issuers do not intend to list the Notes on any securities exchange.

If the closing of this offering of the Notes occurs prior to the consummation of the Seller Notes Repurchase,
concurrently with the closing of the offering of the Notes on the Issue Date, then, pending the satisfaction of the
Escrow Conditions, the gross proceeds of the offering of the Notes will be placed in an escrow account (the “Escrow
**_Account”). If the Escrow Conditions are not satisfied on or prior to the Outside Date (as defined below) (or such_**
earlier date as the Issuer notifies the Escrow Agent (as defined below) in writing that in its reasonable judgment the
Seller Notes Repurchase will not be consummated on or prior to the Outside Date or the Issuer notifies the Escrow
Agent in writing that the Note Purchase Agreement has been terminated), the Notes will be subject to a Special
Mandatory Redemption at a redemption price of 100% of the issue price of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid
interest to, but not including, the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (as defined below). See “—Escrow of Gross
Proceeds; Mandatory Redemption.” The funds in the Escrow Account will be released and applied to pay for any
such redemption and any unpaid fees or expenses of the Escrow Agent, the Trustee and the other agents under the
Indenture, with any excess amounts to be released to the Issuer.

The following description is only a summary of the material provisions of the Indenture and the Escrow
Agreement. It does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the provisions of the
Indenture and the Escrow Agreement, including the definitions therein of certain terms used below. We urge you to
read the Indenture and the Escrow Agreement because they, and not this description, will define your rights as
Holders of the Notes. You may request copies of the Indenture and the Escrow Agreement at our address set forth
under “Where You Can Find More Information.”

**Brief Description of the Notes**

The Notes will be:

    - general senior obligations of the Issuers;

    - equal in right of payment with any existing and future Senior Indebtedness of the Issuers;

    - senior in right of payment to any future Indebtedness of the Issuers that is expressly subordinated in
right of payment to the Notes;


-----

    - effectively senior to all existing and future unsecured Indebtedness of the Issuers, to the extent of the
value of the Collateral owned by the Issuers;

    - effectively senior as to the Fixed Asset Priority Collateral owned by the Issuers with respect to all
existing and future Indebtedness of the Issuers that has a junior priority lien on the Fixed Asset Priority
Collateral, including the Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations, to the extent of the value of such
Fixed Asset Priority Collateral;

    - equal in priority as to the Collateral owned by the Issuers with respect to any Equal Priority
Obligations of the Issuers, including the Senior Secured Credit Facility Obligations and the Existing
Notes, to the extent of the value of such Collateral;

    - effectively subordinated as to the ABL Priority Collateral owned by the Issuers with respect to all
existing and future Indebtedness of the Issuers that has a senior priority lien on the ABL Priority
Collateral, including the Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations, to the extent of the value of such
ABL Priority Collateral;

    - effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness of the Issuers that is secured by Liens
on assets that do not constitute a part of the Collateral to the extent of the value of such assets; and

    - structurally subordinated to all existing and future Indebtedness, claims of holders of Preferred Stock
and other liabilities of any Subsidiary of an Issuer or a Guarantor that is not a guarantor or co-issuer of
the Notes.

**Guarantees**

Holdings and certain of the Issuer’s Restricted Subsidiaries (other than the Co-Issuer) (as detailed below)
will guarantee the Notes. The Issuer’s existing or future Foreign Subsidiaries, any direct or indirect Subsidiary that
is a direct or indirect Domestic Subsidiary of a direct or indirect Foreign Subsidiary that is a CFC, existing or future
FSHCO Subsidiaries, any future Securitization Subsidiaries or any future Captive Insurance Subsidiaries are not
expected to guarantee the Notes.

The Guarantors, as primary obligors and not merely as sureties, will jointly and severally guarantee, fully
and unconditionally, on a senior secured basis, the performance and full and punctual payment when due, whether at
maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all obligations of the Issuers under the Indenture and the Notes, whether
for payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the Notes or expenses, indemnification or otherwise, on
the terms set forth in the Indenture by executing the Indenture or a supplement thereto.

As further described in “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted
Subsidiaries,” in the future, certain additional Restricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer (other than the Co-Issuer) that
guarantee certain Indebtedness of the Issuers or any Subsidiary Guarantor will guarantee the Notes, subject to
certain exceptions and subject to release and discharge as described in this “Description of Notes.”

Each of the Guarantees will be:

    - a general senior obligation of such Guarantor;

    - equal in right of payment with any existing and future Senior Indebtedness of such Guarantor;

    - senior in right of payment to any future Indebtedness of such Guarantor that is expressly subordinated
in right of payment to the Guarantee of such Guarantor;

    - effectively senior to all existing and future unsecured Indebtedness of such Guarantor, to the extent of
the value of the Collateral owned by such Guarantor;


-----

    - effectively senior as to the Fixed Asset Priority Collateral owned by such Guarantor with respect to all
existing and future Indebtedness of such Guarantor that has a junior priority lien on the Fixed Asset
Priority Collateral, including the Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations, to the extent of the value
of such Fixed Asset Priority Collateral;

    - equal in priority as to the Collateral owned by such Guarantor with respect to any Equal Priority
Obligations of such Guarantor, including the Senior Secured Credit Facility Obligations and the
Existing Notes, to the extent of the value of such Collateral;

    - effectively subordinated as to the ABL Priority Collateral owned by such Guarantor with respect to all
existing and future Indebtedness of such Guarantor that has a senior priority lien on the ABL Priority
Collateral, including the Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations, to the extent of the value of such
ABL Priority Collateral;

    - effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness of such Guarantor that is secured by
Liens on assets that do not constitute a part of the Collateral to the extent of the value of such assets;
and

    - structurally subordinated to all existing and future Indebtedness, claims of holders of Preferred Stock
and other liabilities of such Guarantor’s Subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes (other than the
Issuers).

As of March 31, 2024, after giving effect to the offering, the New Term Loan B Facility and the use of
proceeds therefrom:

    - the Issuers and the Guarantors would have had approximately $7,388.7 million in total indebtedness
outstanding (excluding approximately $9.1 million of issued and undrawn letters of credit), none of
which would have been subordinated and all of which would have been senior secured indebtedness,
consisting of $950.0 million under the New Term Loan B Facility, $1,965.5 million of borrowings
under the Term Loan Facilities, $3,523.2 million (equivalent) of the Existing Notes and $950.0 million
of the notes; and

    - the Issuers would have had approximately $399.5 million of availability to incur additional secured
indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility, subject to borrowing base capacity (after giving
effect to approximately $9.1 million of letters of credit outstanding thereunder).

From and after the Issue Date, all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries will be “Restricted Subsidiaries” unless
designated as Unrestricted Subsidiaries in accordance with the Indenture. Under certain circumstances, we will be
permitted to designate certain of our existing and future subsidiaries as “Unrestricted Subsidiaries.” Any
Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture and will not
guarantee the Notes.

For the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, our non-guarantor subsidiaries represented approximately
40% of our net sales, 57% of our EBITDA, 45% of our total assets and 21% of our total liabilities. In the event of a
bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization or similar proceeding of any of our non-guarantor Subsidiaries, such nonguarantor Subsidiaries will pay the holders of their debt and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute
any of their assets to the Issuers or a Guarantor. As a result, all of the existing and future liabilities of our nonguarantor Subsidiaries, including any claims of trade creditors, will be structurally senior to the Notes and the
Guarantees. The Indenture will not limit the amount of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness which may be
incurred by the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries, including the non-guarantor Subsidiaries. Holdings and each
Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer (other than the Co-Issuer) that guarantees the Senior Secured Credit Facilities
will guarantee the Notes.

The obligations of each Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the
Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance under applicable law. This provision may not, however, be


-----

effective to protect a Guarantee from being voided under fraudulent transfer law, or may reduce the applicable
Guarantor’s obligation to an amount that effectively makes its Guarantee worthless. If a Guarantee was rendered
voidable, it could be subordinated by a court to all other indebtedness (including guarantees and other contingent
liabilities) of the Guarantor, and, depending on the amount of such indebtedness, a Guarantor’s liability on its
Guarantee could be reduced to zero. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to our Indebtedness and the Notes—Federal
and state fraudulent transfer laws permit a court, under certain circumstances, to void the notes and the guarantees,
and the liens securing the notes and the guarantees, subordinate claims in respect of the notes, the guarantees and the
liens securing the notes and the guarantees and/or require holders of the notes to return payments received from us in
respect of the guarantees and the liens and, if that occurs, you may not receive any payments on the notes.”

Any Guarantor that makes a payment under its Guarantee will be entitled upon payment in full of all
guaranteed obligations under the Indenture to a contribution from each other Guarantor in an amount equal to such
other Guarantor’s pro rata portion of such payment based on the respective net assets of all the Guarantors at the
time of such payment determined in accordance with GAAP.

Each Guarantor may consolidate with, amalgamate or merge with or into or wind up into, or consummate a
Division as a Dividing Person, or sell all or substantially all its assets to an Issuer or another Guarantor without
limitation or any other Person upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Indenture. See “—Certain Covenants—
Merger, Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets.”

Each Guarantee by a Guarantor will provide by its terms that it will be automatically and unconditionally
released and discharged upon:

(1) in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor, any sale, exchange, issuance, disposition or transfer (by
merger, amalgamation, consolidation, dividend, distribution or otherwise) of (i) the Capital Stock
of such Subsidiary Guarantor, after which the applicable Subsidiary Guarantor is no longer a
Restricted Subsidiary or (ii) all or substantially all the assets of such Subsidiary Guarantor, in each
case if such sale, exchange, issuance, disposition or transfer is made in compliance with or is not
prohibited by the applicable provisions of the Indenture (including any amendments thereof);

(2) the release or discharge of the guarantee by, or direct obligation of, such Guarantor of
Indebtedness under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or the Senior ABL Credit Agreement, or
the release or discharge of such other guarantee or direct obligation that resulted in the creation of
such Guarantee, except a discharge or release by or as a result of payment under such guarantee or
direct obligation (it being understood that a release subject to a contingent reinstatement will
constitute a release for the purposes of this provision, and that if any such Guarantee is so
reinstated, such Guarantee shall also be reinstated to the extent that such Guarantor would then be
required to provide a Guarantee pursuant to the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—
Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries”);

(3) in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor, the designation of any Restricted Subsidiary that is a
Subsidiary Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in compliance with the applicable provisions
of the Indenture or the occurrence of any event following which the Subsidiary Guarantor is no
longer a Restricted Subsidiary in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture;

(4) upon the merger, amalgamation, consolidation or Division of any Guarantor with and into the
Issuer, the Co-Issuer or another Guarantor or upon the liquidation or winding up of such
Guarantor, in each case, in compliance with or in a manner not prohibited by the applicable
provisions of the Indenture;

(5) the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event;

(6) as described under “—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver” or in accordance with the provisions
of the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement or the ABL/Fixed Asset Intercreditor Agreement;


-----

(7) the exercise by the Issuers of their legal defeasance option or covenant defeasance option as
described under “—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” or the discharge of the Issuers’
obligations under the Indenture in accordance with the terms of the Indenture; or

(8) in the case of Holdings, if Holdings ceases to be the direct parent of the Issuer as a result of a
transaction or designation permitted pursuant to the definition of “Holdings”.

Notwithstanding clause (5) above, if, after any Covenant Suspension Event, a Reversion Date shall occur,
then the Suspension Period with respect to such Covenant Suspension Event shall terminate and all actions
reasonably necessary to provide that the Notes shall have been unconditionally guaranteed by each Guarantor (to the
extent such guarantee is required by the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees
of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries”) shall be taken within 90 days after such Reversion Date or as soon as
reasonably practicable thereafter. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to our Indebtedness and the Notes—Federal
and state fraudulent transfer laws permit a court, under certain circumstances, to void the notes and the guarantees,
and the liens securing the notes and the guarantees, subordinate claims in respect of the notes, the guarantees and the
liens securing the notes and the guarantees and/or require holders of the notes to return payments received from us in
respect of the guarantees and the liens and, if that occurs, you may not receive any payments on the notes.”

Upon any occurrence giving rise to a release of a Guarantee, as specified above, the Trustee, subject to
receipt of an Officer’s Certificate from the Issuer and at the Issuers’ expense, will execute such documents
reasonably requested by the Issuer in order to evidence or effect such release, discharge and termination in respect of
such Guarantee. None of the Issuers, the Trustee or any Guarantor will be required to make a notation on the notes
to reflect any such release, discharge or termination. The Trustee shall not be liable for any such release undertaken
in reliance upon any such Officer’s Certificate.

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

The Issuers will issue an aggregate principal amount of $950.0 million of Notes on the Issue Date. The
Notes will mature on     , 2031.

Subject to compliance with the covenants described below under the caption “—Certain Covenants—
Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” and “—Liens,”
the Issuers may issue additional Notes (“Additional Notes”) from time to time after this offering under the
Indenture. The Notes and any Additional Notes subsequently issued under the Indenture will be treated as a single
class for all purposes under the Indenture, including waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase;
_provided, however, that a separate CUSIP or ISIN will be issued for the Additional Notes, unless the Notes and the_
Additional Notes are treated as fungible for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Unless the context requires otherwise,
references to “Notes” for all purposes of the Indenture and this “Description of Notes” include any Additional Notes
that are actually issued.

The Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of $2,000 and any integral multiples of $1,000 in
excess thereof.

Interest on the Notes will accrue at the rate of      % per annum. Interest on the Notes will be payable
semi-annually in arrears on each      and      to the Holders of record on the immediately
preceding      and      (whether or not a Business Day), respectively. Interest on the Notes will accrue from the
most recent date on which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from and including the Issue Date.
If the Issuers deliver global notes to the Trustee or the registrar for cancellation on a date that is on or after the
record date and on or before the corresponding interest payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest up to, but
excluding, the redemption date will be paid on the redemption date to the Holder in whose name the Note is
registered at the close of business on such record date in accordance with the applicable procedures of The
Depository Trust Company (“DTC”), and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Notes will be
subject to redemption by the Issuers. Interest on the Notes will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year
comprised of twelve 30-day months.


-----

**Payment of Principal, Premium and Interest**

Cash payments of principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, the Notes will be payable at the office or
agency of the Issuers maintained for such purpose (the “Paying Agent”) or, at the option of the Issuers, cash
payment of interest on the Notes may be made through the paying agent by check mailed to the Holders of the Notes
at their respective addresses set forth in the register of Holders; provided, that (a) all cash payments of principal,
premium, if any, and interest with respect to the Notes represented by one or more global notes registered in the
name of or held by DTC or its nominee will be made through the Paying Agent by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the accounts specified by the registered Holder or Holders thereof and (b) all cash payments of
principal, premium, if any, and interest with respect to certificated Notes may, at the option of the Issuers, be made
by wire transfer to a U.S. dollar account maintained by the payee with a bank in the United States if the applicable
Holder elects payment by wire transfer by giving written notice to the Trustee or the Paying Agent to such effect
designating such account no later than 30 days immediately preceding the relevant due date for payment (or such
other date as the Trustee or Paying Agent may accept in their discretion). Until otherwise designated by the Issuers,
the Issuers’ office or agency will be the office of the Trustee maintained for such purpose in the United States.

**Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent for the Notes**

The Issuer will maintain one or more paying agents for the Notes. The initial Paying Agent for the Notes
will be U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association.

The Issuer will also maintain one or more registrars and transfer agents for the Notes. The initial Registrar
and Transfer Agent will be U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association. The Registrar will maintain a register
reflecting ownership of the Notes outstanding from time to time. The paying agent will make payments on, and the
transfer agent will facilitate transfer of, the Notes on behalf of the Issuer.

The Issuer may change the paying agent, the registrar or the transfer agent without prior notice to the
Holders. The Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may act as a paying agent, registrar or transfer agent.

**Transfer and Exchange**

A Holder may transfer or exchange Notes in accordance with the Indenture. The registrar and the Trustee
may require a Holder to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents in connection with a transfer of
Notes. Holders will be required to pay all taxes due on transfer. The Issuer and the transfer agent will not be required
to transfer or exchange any Note selected for redemption or tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in
connection with a Change of Control Offer, an Alternate Offer or an Asset Sale Offer. Also, the Issuer and the
transfer agent will not be required to transfer or exchange any Note for a period of 15 days before the delivery of a
notice of redemption of Notes to be redeemed or between record date and payment date. The registered Holder of a
Note will be treated as the owner of the Note for all purposes.

**Security for the Notes**

**_Collateral Generally_**

The Notes and the Guarantees will be secured by (a) senior priority Liens on the Fixed Asset Priority
Collateral, which will also secure (i) the Senior Secured Credit Facility Obligations, the Existing Equal Priority
Notes Obligations and all other Equal Priority Obligations on an equal priority basis (but without regard to the
control of remedies) and (ii) the Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations on a junior priority basis and (b) junior
priority liens on the ABL Priority Collateral, which will also secure (i) the Senior Secured Credit Facility
Obligations, the Existing Equal Priority Notes Obligations and all other Equal Priority Obligations on an equal
priority basis (but without regard to the control of remedies) and (ii) the Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations
on a senior priority basis. The Equal Priority Obligations and the Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations may
include, as applicable, certain Hedging Obligations and certain other obligations in respect of cash management
services (including bank products obligations). Certain secured parties other than the Holders, the Trustee and the
Notes Collateral Agent will have rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral that, if exercised, could adversely


-----

affect the value of the Collateral benefiting the Holders, particularly the rights described below under “—Equal
Priority Intercreditor Agreement” and “—ABL/Fixed Asset Intercreditor Agreement.”

The Issuers and the Guarantors are and will be able to incur additional Indebtedness in the future which
could share in the Collateral, including Additional Equal Priority Obligations, additional Senior ABL Revolving
Credit Obligations and Obligations secured by Permitted Liens. With respect to the Issuers and the Guarantors, the
amount of such additional Obligations will be limited by the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—
Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” and “—Certain
Covenants—Liens.” Under certain circumstances, the amount of any such additional Obligations could be
significant.

By their acceptance of the Notes, the Holders are deemed to have approved the Security Documents and
authorized and directed the Notes Collateral Agent to enter into and perform its obligations under the Security
Documents, binding the Holders to the terms thereof.

**_Certain Limitations on the Collateral_**

The Collateral securing the Notes will not include any of the following assets (the “Excluded Assets”):

(1) any property or assets owned by any Foreign Subsidiary (unless such Subsidiary becomes a
Guarantor), any Unrestricted Subsidiary (unless such Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a
Guarantor at the option of the Issuer) or any Subsidiary which is not a Guarantor;

(2) any lease, license, contract, agreement or other general intangible or any property subject to a
purchase money security interest, Financing Lease Obligation or similar arrangement, in each case
permitted or otherwise not prohibited under the Indenture, to the extent that a grant of a security
interest therein would violate or invalidate such lease, license, contract, agreement or other general
intangible, Financing Lease Obligations or purchase money arrangement or create a right of
termination in favor of any other party thereto (other than the Issuers or a Guarantor) after giving
effect to the applicable anti-assignment provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code or other
applicable law, other than proceeds and receivables thereof, the assignment of which is expressly
deemed effective under the Uniform Commercial Code or other applicable law notwithstanding
such prohibition;

(3) any interest in real property;

(4) any interest in leased real property (including any requirement to deliver landlord waivers,
estoppels and collateral access letters);

(5) motor vehicles, aircrafts, airframes, aircrafts engines or helicopters and other assets subject to
certificates of title;

(6) margin stock and Equity Interests of any Person other than the Issuer and each wholly owned
Subsidiary of the Issuer that is a Restricted Subsidiary (that is also not an Excluded Subsidiary (as
defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities) (other than any Restricted Subsidiary that is an

or “Amendment to Allege Use” with respect thereto, to the extent, if any, that, and solely during

Issuer in consultation with the Bank Collateral Agent;

deemed effective under the Uniform Commercial Code or other applicable law notwithstanding
such prohibition or restriction;

(10) any assets to the extent pledges and security interests therein are prohibited or restricted by
(1) applicable law whether on the Issue Date or thereafter (including any requirement to obtain the
consent of any governmental authority or third party (other than the Issuers or any Guarantor)) or
(2) any contract to which such asset is subject binding on the Issuers or any Guarantor or that
would require any consent, approval, license or other authorization of any third party (other than
the Issuers or any Guarantor) or governmental or regulatory authority pursuant to such a contract
(provided that such prohibition or requirement described in this clause (2) either (A) existed on or
prior to the Issue Date or at the time of the acquisition of such asset by the Issuers or any
Restricted Subsidiary, as applicable, and was not incurred in contemplation thereof or (B) is of a
similar type of arrangement as those existing on such date that is entered into in the ordinary
course of business or is consistent with past practice of the Issuers or any Guarantor), in each case,
after giving effect to the anti-assignment provision of the Uniform Commercial Code or other
applicable law, other than proceeds and receivables thereof, the assignment of which is expressly
deemed effective under the Uniform Commercial Code or other applicable law notwithstanding
such prohibition or restriction;

(11) all commercial tort claims;

extent constituting Collateral in respect of the Senior ABL Credit Facility or to the extent

Uniform Commercial Code financing statement);

(14) cash and Cash Equivalents (other than cash and Cash Equivalents to the extent constituting
Collateral in respect of the Senior ABL Credit Facility or to the extent constituting proceeds of
Collateral);

by the Issuer;

Facilities (whether pursuant to the terms of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities (and any related
document) as a result of any determination made thereunder, or by amendment, waiver or
otherwise);

the extent such proceeds would otherwise be excluded pursuant to clauses (1) through (19) above.

The security interests in the Collateral securing the Notes (other than as set forth in the following proviso) will
not be required to be perfected on the Issue Date, but will be required to be perfected no later than 90 days after the
Issue Date (or such later date as the Bank Collateral Agents may agree with respect to similar obligations in respect
of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or as the Senior ABL Credit Agreement Collateral Agent may agree with
respect to similar obligations in respect of the Senior ABL Credit Agreement, as applicable) or as promptly as
reasonably practicable thereafter; provided, however, the perfection of the security interests (1) in the certificated
Equity Interests of the Issuer and, to the extent received by the Issuer after use of its commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain such certificates, the Issuer’s wholly-owned Domestic Subsidiaries will be required to be delivered on the
Issue Date and (2) in other assets with respect to which a Lien may be perfected by the filing of a UCC financing
statement (or equivalent), which UCC financing statement (or equivalent) will be required to be filed as of the Issue
Date.

In addition:

(a) Liens required to be granted from time to time pursuant to the Indenture shall be subject to

Cash Equivalents, deposit accounts, securities accounts, commodities accounts or other assets
requiring perfection by control agreements;

(c) no actions in any non-U.S. jurisdiction or required by the laws of any non-U.S. jurisdiction shall
be required in order to create any security interests in assets located or titled outside of the United
States (and the Notes Collateral Agent shall not be permitted to take any actions under such laws
of any such non-U.S. jurisdiction) (including any intellectual property rights and foreign
intellectual property) or to perfect any security interests in any such assets (it being understood
that there shall be no Security Document (or other security agreements or pledge agreements)
governed under the laws of any non-U.S. jurisdiction); and

(d) except to the extent that perfection and priority may be achieved by the filing of a financing
statement under the Uniform Commercial Code with respect to the Issuers or a Guarantor, there
will be no requirements as to perfection or priority with respect to any assets or property described
in clauses (b) or (c) of this paragraph.

It is understood and agreed that prior to the discharge of the Senior Secured Credit Facility Obligations, to
the extent that the Bank Collateral Agent is satisfied with or agree to any deliveries or documents required to be
provided in respect of any matters relating to the Collateral or make any determination in respect of any matters
relating to the Collateral (including, without limitation, extensions of time or waivers for the creation and perfection
of security interests in, or the obtaining of legal opinions or other deliverables, if applicable, with respect to,
particular assets (including in connection with assets acquired, or Subsidiaries formed or acquired, after the Issue
Date)), the Notes Collateral Agent shall be deemed to be satisfied with such deliveries and/or documents and the


-----

judgment of the Bank Collateral Agent in respect of any such matters shall be deemed to be the judgment of the
Notes Collateral Agent in respect of such matters under the Indenture and the Security Documents.

It is understood and agreed that prior to the discharge of the Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations, to
the extent that the Senior ABL Credit Agreement Collateral Agent is satisfied with or agrees to any deliveries or
documents required to be provided in respect of any matters relating to the ABL Priority Collateral or makes any
determination in respect of any matters relating to the ABL Priority Collateral (including, without limitation,
extensions of time or waivers for the creation and perfection of security interests in, or the obtaining of legal
opinions or other deliverables, if applicable, with respect to, particular assets (including in connection with assets
acquired, or Subsidiaries formed or acquired, after the Issue Date)), the Notes Collateral Agent shall be deemed to
be satisfied with such deliveries and/or documents and the judgment of the Senior ABL Credit Agreement Collateral
Agent in respect of any such matters shall be deemed to be the judgment of the Notes Collateral Agent in respect of
such matters under the Indenture and the Security Documents.

**_After-Acquired Collateral_**

From and after the Issue Date, and subject to certain limitations and exceptions, if the Issuers or any
Guarantor acquires any property or rights which are of a type constituting Collateral under any Security Document
(excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any Excluded Assets or assets not required to be Collateral pursuant to the
Indenture or the Security Documents), they will be required to execute and deliver such security instruments,
financing statements and such certificates as are required under the Indenture or any Security Document to vest in
the Notes Collateral Agent a perfected security interest (subject to Permitted Liens) in such after-acquired collateral
and to take such actions to add such after-acquired collateral to the Collateral, and thereupon all provisions of the
Indenture and the Security Documents relating to the Collateral shall be deemed to relate to such after-acquired
collateral to the same extent and with the same force and effect. For the avoidance of doubt, opinions of counsel will
not be required in connection with the addition of new Guarantors or in connection with such Guarantors entering
into the Security Documents or to vest in the Notes Collateral Agent a perfected security interest in after-acquired
collateral owned by such Guarantors.

**_Further Assurances_**

On or following the Issue Date and subject to the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement and the
ABL/Fixed Asset Intercreditor Agreement, as the case may be, the Issuers and the Guarantors shall execute any and
all further documents, financing statements (including continuation statements and amendments to financing
statements), agreements and instruments, and take all further action that may be required under applicable law in
order to grant, preserve, maintain, protect and perfect (or continue the perfection of) the validity and priority of the
security interests created or intended to be created by the Security Documents in the Collateral.

**_Liens with Respect to the Collateral_**

On the Issue Date, the Issuers, the Guarantors and the Notes Collateral Agent will enter into the applicable
Security Documents establishing the terms of the security interests with respect to the Collateral. These security
interests will secure the payment and performance when due of all of the Notes Obligations of the Issuers and the
Guarantors.

**_Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement_**

The Existing Notes Collateral Agent and the Bank Collateral Agent entered into an intercreditor agreement
dated as of May 31, 2023 (as the same may be amended from time to time or any other intercreditor agreement
substantially in the form thereof, the “Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement”) with respect to the Collateral,
which may be amended from time to time without the consent of the Holders to add other parties holding Equal
Priority Obligations permitted to be incurred under the Indenture, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Equal
Priority Intercreditor Agreement.


-----

The Notes Collateral Agent will enter into a joinder to the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement in respect
of the Collateral securing the Equal Priority Obligations. Under the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement, subject
to the provisions set forth in the ABL/Fixed Asset Intercreditor Agreement with respect to the ABL Priority
Collateral, only the “Controlling Collateral Agent” will have the right to act or refrain from acting with respect to
any Shared Collateral. The Controlling Collateral Agent will initially be the Bank Collateral Agent and will remain
the Bank Collateral Agent until the earlier of (1) the Discharge of Equal Priority Obligations that are Senior Secured
Credit Facility Obligations and (2) the Non-Controlling Collateral Agent Enforcement Date (such earlier date, the
“Controlling Collateral Agent Change Date”). After the Controlling Collateral Agent Change Date, the Controlling
Collateral Agent will be the Collateral Agent (other than the Bank Collateral Agent) of the Series of Equal Priority
Obligations that constitutes the largest outstanding principal amount of any then outstanding Series of Equal Priority
Obligations (excluding the obligations under the Term Loan Facilities) with respect to such Shared Collateral (the
“Major Non-Controlling Collateral Agent”).

With respect to any Shared Collateral, no Non-Controlling Collateral Agent or other Non-Controlling
Secured Party shall, or shall instruct the Controlling Collateral Agent to, commence any judicial or nonjudicial
foreclosure proceedings with respect to, seek to have a trustee, receiver, liquidator or similar official appointed for
or over, attempt any action to take possession of, exercise any right, remedy or power with respect to, or otherwise
take any action to enforce its security interest in or realize upon, or take any other action available to it in respect of,
any Shared Collateral.

The “Non-Controlling Collateral Agent Enforcement Date” means, with respect to any Non-Controlling
Collateral Agent, the date that is 120 days (throughout which 120-day period such Non-Controlling Collateral Agent
was the Major Non-Controlling Collateral Agent) after the occurrence of both (a) an event of default, as defined in
the indenture or other debt facility for the applicable Series of Equal Priority Obligations, and (b) the Controlling
Collateral Agent and each other Collateral Agent’s receipt of written notice from such Non-Controlling Collateral
Agent certifying that (i) such Non-Controlling Collateral Agent is the Major Non-Controlling Collateral Agent and
that an event of default, as defined in the indenture or other debt facility for that Series of Equal Priority Obligations
has occurred and is continuing and (ii) the Equal Priority Obligations of that Series are currently due and payable in
full (whether as a result of acceleration thereof or otherwise) in accordance with the indenture or debt facility for
that Series of Equal Priority Obligations; provided that the Non-Controlling Collateral Agent Enforcement Date will
be stayed and will not occur and will be deemed not to have occurred with respect to any Shared Collateral (1) at
any time the Controlling Collateral Agent has commenced and is diligently pursuing any enforcement action with
respect to such Shared Collateral or any portion thereof or (2) at any time the Issuers or the Guarantors that have
granted a security interest in such Shared Collateral are then debtors under or with respect to (or otherwise subject
to) any insolvency or liquidation proceeding.

The Controlling Collateral Agent will initially be the Bank Collateral Agent and the Notes Collateral Agent
will have no rights to take any action under the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement with respect to the Shared
Collateral unless and until it becomes the Controlling Collateral Agent.

Notwithstanding the equal priority of the Liens with respect to the Shared Collateral, the Controlling
Collateral Agent may deal with the Shared Collateral as if the Controlling Collateral Agent had a senior Lien on
such Collateral. No Non-Controlling Collateral Agent or Non-Controlling Secured Party will contest, protest or
object to any foreclosure proceeding or action brought by the Controlling Collateral Agent or any Controlling
Secured Party or any other exercise by the Controlling Collateral Agent or any Controlling Secured Party of any
rights and remedies relating to the Shared Collateral. Each of the Equal Priority Secured Parties also will agree that
it will not (and will waive any right to) contest or support any other person in contesting, in any proceeding
(including any insolvency or liquidation proceeding), the perfection, priority, validity, attachment or enforceability
of a Lien held by or on behalf of any of the Equal Priority Secured Parties in all or any part of the Collateral, or the
provisions of the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement.

If an Event of Default or an event of default under any document governing a Series of Equal Priority
Obligations has occurred and is continuing and the Controlling Collateral Agent is taking action to enforce rights in
respect of any Shared Collateral, or any distribution is made with respect to any Shared Collateral in any insolvency
or liquidation proceeding of the Issuers or any Guarantor (including any adequate protection payments) or any Equal
Priority Secured Party receives any payment pursuant to any intercreditor agreement (other than the Equal Priority


-----

Intercreditor Agreement ) with respect to any Shared Collateral, the proceeds of any sale, collection or other
liquidation of any such Shared Collateral by any Collateral Agent or any Equal Priority Secured Party and proceeds
of any such distribution or payment (subject, in the case of any such distribution, payments or proceeds, to the
paragraph immediately following and the ABL/Fixed Asset Intercreditor Agreement) to which the Equal Priority
Obligations are entitled under such other intercreditor agreement shall be applied:

(A) FIRST, in payment of all amounts owing to each Collateral Agent (in its capacity as such); and

(B) SECOND, subject to the immediately following paragraph, among the Equal Priority Obligations
to the payment in full of the Equal Priority Obligations on a ratable basis, with such proceeds to be
applied to the Equal Priority Obligations of a given Series in accordance with the terms of the
applicable Equal Priority Documents for such Series; provided that following the commencement
of any insolvency or liquidation proceeding of the Issuers or any Guarantor, solely as among the
holders of Equal Priority Obligations and solely for purposes of this clause SECOND and not the
indenture or other debt facility for the applicable Series of Equal Priority Obligations, in the event
the value of the Shared Collateral is not sufficient for the entire amount of Post-Petition Interest on
the Equal Priority Obligations to be allowed under Section 506(a) and (b) of the Bankruptcy Code
or any other applicable provision of the Bankruptcy Code or other applicable bankruptcy law in
such insolvency or liquidation proceeding, the amount of Equal Priority Obligations of each Series
of Equal Priority Obligations shall include only the maximum amount of Post-Petition Interest on
the Equal Priority Obligations allowable under Section 506(a) and (b) of the Bankruptcy Code or
any other applicable provision of the Bankruptcy Code or other applicable bankruptcy law in such
insolvency or liquidation proceeding. “Post-Petition Interest” for purposes of the Equal Priority
Intercreditor Agreement means any interest or entitlement to fees or expenses or other charges that
accrue after the commencement of any insolvency or liquidation proceeding, whether or not
allowed or allowable as a claim in any such insolvency or liquidation proceeding; and

(C) THIRD, after the discharge of all Equal Priority Obligations, to the Grantors or their successors or
assigns, as their interests may appear, or to whosoever may be lawfully entitled to receive the
same.

It is the intention of the Equal Priority Secured Parties of each Series that the holders of Equal Priority
Obligations of such Series (and not the Equal Priority Secured Parties of any other Series) bear the risk of (i) any
determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that (x) any of the Equal Priority Obligations of such Series are
unenforceable under applicable law or are subordinated to any other obligations (other than another Series of Equal
Priority Obligations), (y) any of the Equal Priority Obligations of such Series do not have an enforceable security
interest in any of the Collateral securing any other Series of Equal Priority Obligations and/or (z) any intervening
security interest exists securing any other obligations (other than another Series of Equal Priority Obligations) on a
basis ranking prior to the security interest of such Series of Equal Priority Obligations but junior to the security
interest of any other Series of Equal Priority Obligations or (ii) the existence of any Collateral for any other Series of
Equal Priority Obligations that is not Shared Collateral (any such condition referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) or
(ii) with respect to any Series of Equal Priority Obligations, an “Impairment” of such Series). In the event of any
Impairment with respect to any Series of Equal Priority Obligations, the results of such Impairment shall be borne
solely by the holders of such Series of Equal Priority Obligations, and the rights of the holders of such Series of
Equal Priority Obligations (including, without limitation, the right to receive distributions in respect of such Series
of Equal Priority Obligations permitted by the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement) set forth in the Equal Priority
Intercreditor Agreement shall be modified to the extent necessary so that the effects of such Impairment are borne
solely by the holders of the Series of such Equal Priority Obligations subject to such Impairment. Additionally, in
the event the Equal Priority Obligations of any Series are modified pursuant to applicable law (including, without
limitation, pursuant to Section 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code), any reference to such Equal Priority Obligations or
the Equal Priority Documents governing such Equal Priority Obligations shall refer to such obligations or such
documents as so modified.

None of the Equal Priority Secured Parties may institute in any suit, bankruptcy, insolvency or other
proceeding any claim against the Controlling Collateral Agent or any other Equal Priority Secured Party seeking
damages from or other relief by way of specific performance, instructions or otherwise with respect to any Shared


-----

Collateral. In addition, none of the Equal Priority Secured Parties may seek to have any Collateral or any part
thereof marshaled upon any foreclosure or other disposition of such Collateral. If any Equal Priority Secured Party
obtains possession of any Shared Collateral or realizes any proceeds or payment in respect thereof pursuant to any
Equal Priority Security Document or by the exercise of any rights available to it under applicable law or in any
insolvency or liquidation proceeding or through any other exercise of remedies (including pursuant to any
intercreditor agreement), at any time prior to the discharge of each of the Equal Priority Obligations, then it must
hold such Shared Collateral, proceeds or payment in trust for the other Equal Priority Secured Parties and promptly
transfer such Shared Collateral, proceeds or payment to the Controlling Collateral Agent to be distributed in
accordance with the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement.

Under the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement, if at any time the Controlling Collateral Agent forecloses
upon or otherwise exercises remedies against any Shared Collateral resulting in a sale or disposition thereof, then
(whether or not any insolvency or liquidation proceeding is pending at the time) the Liens in favor of the other
Collateral Agents for the benefit of the Trustee, the Notes Collateral Agent and the Holders of the Notes and each
other Series of Equal Priority Secured Parties upon such Shared Collateral will automatically be released and
discharged. However, any proceeds of any Shared Collateral realized therefrom will be applied as described in the
Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement.

The Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the provisions of it are intended to be and
shall be enforceable under Section 510(a) of the Bankruptcy Code or under any equivalent provision of any other
applicable Bankruptcy Law.

_Certain Limitations Applicable in Bankruptcy Proceedings_

If the Issuers or any Guarantor become subject to any bankruptcy case, the Equal Priority Intercreditor
Agreement provides that if the Issuers or any Guarantor shall, as debtor(s)-in-possession, move for approval of
financing (“DIP Financing”) to be provided by one or more lenders (the “DIP Lenders”) under Section 364 of the
Bankruptcy Code and/or the use of cash collateral under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code (in each case, or under
any equivalent provision of any other applicable bankruptcy law), each Equal Priority Secured Party will agree not
to object to any such financing or to the Liens on the Shared Collateral securing the same (the “DIP Financing
**_Liens”) and/or to any use of cash collateral that constitutes Shared Collateral, unless the Controlling Collateral_**
Agent opposes or objects to such DIP Financing or such DIP Financing Liens and/or use of cash collateral (and (i) to
the extent that such DIP Financing Liens are senior to the Liens on any such Shared Collateral for the benefit of the
Controlling Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Secured Party will subordinate its Liens with respect to such
Shared Collateral on the same terms as the Liens of the Controlling Secured Parties (other than any Liens of any
Equal Priority Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) are subordinated thereto, and (ii) to the extent that
such DIP Financing Liens rank on an equal priority basis with the Liens on any such Shared Collateral granted to
secure the Equal Priority Obligations of the Controlling Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Secured Party will
confirm the priorities with respect to such Shared Collateral as set forth in the Equal Priority Intercreditor
Agreement), in each case so long as:

(A) the Equal Priority Secured Parties of each Series retain the benefit of their Liens on all such
Shared Collateral pledged to the DIP Lenders, including proceeds thereof arising after the
commencement of such proceeding, with the same priority vis-a-vis all the other Equal Priority
Secured Parties (other than any Liens of the Equal Priority Secured Parties constituting DIP
Financing Liens) as existed prior to the commencement of the bankruptcy case;

(B) the Equal Priority Secured Parties of each Series are granted Liens on any additional collateral
pledged to any Equal Priority Secured Parties as adequate protection or otherwise in connection
with such DIP Financing or use of cash collateral, with the same priority vis-a-vis the Equal
Priority Secured Parties (other than any Liens of the Equal Priority Secured Parties constituting
DIP Financing Liens) as set forth in the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement ;

(C) if any amount of such DIP Financing and/or cash collateral is applied to repay any of the Equal
Priority Obligations, such amount is applied pursuant to the Equal Priority Intercreditor
Agreement; and


-----

(D) if any Equal Priority Secured Parties are granted adequate protection, including in the form of
periodic payments, in connection with such DIP Financing and/or use of cash collateral, the
proceeds of such adequate protection are applied pursuant to the Equal Priority Intercreditor
Agreement; provided that the Equal Priority Secured Parties of each Series will have a right to
object to the grant of a Lien to secure the DIP Financing over any Collateral subject to Liens in
favor of the Equal Priority Secured Parties of such Series or its representative that do not
constitute Shared Collateral; and provided, further, that the Equal Priority Secured Parties
receiving adequate protection shall not object to any other Equal Priority Secured Party receiving
adequate protection comparable to any adequate protection granted to such Equal Priority Secured
Parties in connection with a DIP Financing or use of cash collateral.

The Equal Priority Secured Parties acknowledge that the Equal Priority Obligations of any Series may,
subject to the limitations set forth in the other Equal Priority Documents, be increased, extended, renewed, replaced,
restated, supplemented, restructured, repaid, refunded, refinanced or otherwise amended or modified from time to
time, all without affecting the priority of claims and application of proceeds set forth in the Equal Priority
Intercreditor Agreement or the other provisions thereof defining the relative rights of the Equal Priority Secured
Parties of any Series.

**_ABL/Fixed Asset Intercreditor Agreement_**

The Bank Collateral Agent, the Existing Notes Collateral Agent and the Senior ABL Credit Agreement
Collateral Agent (each acting in such capacity, the “Applicable Collateral Agents”) entered into an intercreditor
agreement dated as of May 31, 2023 (as the same may be amended from time to time, the “ABL/Fixed Asset
**_Intercreditor Agreement”) with respect to the Collateral, which may be amended from time to time without the_**
consent of the Holders to add other parties holding Additional Equal Priority Obligations, Senior ABL Revolving
Credit Obligations or Junior Lien Obligations permitted to be incurred under the then extant relevant agreements, or
their respective representatives.

The Notes Collateral Agent will enter into a joinder to the ABL/Fixed Asset Intercreditor Agreement in
respect of the Collateral securing the Equal Priority Obligations. The ABL/Fixed Asset Intercreditor Agreement sets
forth the relative priority of the Liens securing the Equal Priority Obligations and, if applicable, certain future Junior
Lien Obligations (the “Non-ABL Obligations”), on the one hand, compared to the Liens on the Collateral securing
the Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations (collectively, all such Non-ABL Obligations and Senior ABL
Revolving Credit Obligations, the “Applicable Obligations”), on the other hand. Although the holders of Non-ABL
Obligations and Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations will not be parties to the ABL/Fixed Asset Intercreditor
Agreement, by their acceptance of the instruments evidencing such Obligations, each authorizes their Applicable
Collateral Agent to enter into the ABL/Fixed Asset Intercreditor Agreement and each agrees to be bound thereby.
The ABL/Fixed Asset Intercreditor Agreement will allocate the benefits of any Collateral between the holders of the
Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations on the one hand and the holders of the Non-ABL Obligations on the other
hand.

The ABL/Fixed Asset Intercreditor Agreement will provide, among other things:

_Lien Priority. Notwithstanding the time, order or method of grant, creation, attachment or perfection of any_
Liens securing any Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations (the “ABL Liens”), the Liens securing any Non-ABL
Obligations (the “Non-ABL Liens”), the defects or deficiencies in any such Liens or other circumstances
whatsoever, (1) the ABL Liens on the ABL Priority Collateral securing such Senior ABL Revolving Credit
Obligations will rank senior to any Non-ABL Liens on the ABL Priority Collateral securing such Non-ABL
Obligations, and (2) the Non-ABL Liens on the Fixed Asset Priority Collateral securing such Non-ABL Obligations
will rank senior to any ABL Liens on the Fixed Asset Priority Collateral securing such Senior ABL Revolving
Credit Obligations.

_Prohibition on Contesting Liens and Obligations. No Applicable Collateral Agent with respect to, and no_
holder of, any class of Applicable Obligations may contest or support any other person in contesting the validity,
perfection, priority or enforceability of the Liens of any other Applicable Collateral Agent with respect to, or holder
of, any other class of Applicable Obligations.


-----

_Exercise of Remedies and Release of Liens with respect to the ABL Priority Collateral. Prior to the_
discharge of the Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations, the Senior ABL Credit Agreement Collateral Agent will
have the sole power to exercise remedies against the ABL Priority Collateral (subject to the right of each Collateral
Agent for any series of Equal Priority Obligations to take limited protective measures with respect to the Non-ABL
Liens and to take certain actions that would be permitted to be taken by unsecured creditors not otherwise prohibited
by the ABL/Fixed Asset Intercreditor Agreement) and to foreclose upon and dispose of the ABL Priority Collateral.
Upon any sale of any ABL Priority Collateral in connection with any exercise of remedies with respect to such ABL
Priority Collateral that results in the release of the Liens of the Senior ABL Credit Agreement Collateral Agent on
such item of ABL Priority Collateral, the Liens of each other class of Applicable Obligations on such item of ABL
Priority Collateral will be automatically released.

_Exercise of Remedies and Release of Liens with respect to the Fixed Asset Priority Collateral. Prior to the_
discharge of the Non-ABL Obligations, the Controlling Collateral Agent (or any person authorized by it) will have
the sole power to exercise remedies against the Fixed Asset Priority Collateral (subject to the right of the Senior
ABL Credit Agreement Collateral Agent to take limited protective measures with respect to the ABL Liens and to
take certain actions that would be permitted to be taken by unsecured creditors not otherwise prohibited by the
ABL/Fixed Asset Intercreditor Agreement) and to foreclose upon and dispose of the Fixed Asset Priority Collateral.
Upon any sale of any Fixed Asset Priority Collateral in connection with any exercise of remedies with respect to
such Fixed Asset Priority Collateral that results in the release of the Liens of such Controlling Collateral Agent on
such item of Fixed Asset Priority Collateral, the Liens of each other class of Applicable Obligations on such item of
Fixed Asset Priority Collateral will be automatically released.

_Application of Proceeds and Turn-Over Provisions. In connection with any enforcement action with_
respect to the Collateral or in respect of any insolvency or liquidation proceeding, (x)(1) all proceeds of ABL
Priority Collateral will first be applied to the repayment of all Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations in
accordance with the Senior ABL Credit Agreement, before being applied to any Non-ABL Obligations; and (2) after
the discharge of Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations, if any Non-ABL Obligations remain outstanding, all
proceeds of ABL Priority Collateral will be applied to the repayment of any outstanding Non-ABL Obligations in
accordance with the terms of the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement and any other applicable intercreditor
agreement; and (y)(1) all proceeds of Fixed Asset Priority Collateral shall be applied to Non-ABL Obligations in
accordance with the terms of the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement and any other applicable intercreditor
agreement, before being applied to the Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations; and (2) after the discharge of
Non-ABL Obligations, if any Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations remain outstanding, all proceeds of Fixed
Asset Priority Collateral will be applied to the repayment of any outstanding Senior ABL Revolving Credit
Obligations in accordance with the Senior ABL Credit Agreement. If any holder of any Applicable Obligations or if
any Applicable Collateral Agent receives any proceeds of Collateral in contravention of the foregoing, such
proceeds will be turned over to the Applicable Collateral Agent entitled to receive such proceeds pursuant to the
prior sentence, for application in accordance with the prior sentence.

_Amendment and Refinancings. The Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations and the Non-ABL_
Obligations may be amended or refinanced subject to continuing rights of the holders of such refinancing
Indebtedness under the ABL/Fixed Asset Intercreditor Agreement, the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement and
any other applicable intercreditor agreement.

_Tracing of Proceeds. Each Applicable Collateral Agent will agree, that prior to any issuance of notice of an_
exercise of remedies by any other Applicable Collateral Agent (unless a bankruptcy or insolvency event of default
then exists), any proceeds of Collateral, whether or not deposited under control agreements, which are used by the
Issuer, the Co-Issuer or any Guarantor to acquire other property which is Collateral shall not (solely as between the
Collateral Agents) be treated as proceeds of Collateral for purposes of determining the relative priorities in the
Collateral which was so acquired.

In addition, the ABL/Fixed Asset Intercreditor Agreement will provide that if the Issuers or any Guarantor
is subject to a case under the Bankruptcy Code or any other bankruptcy law:

(A) if the Senior ABL Credit Agreement Collateral Agent desires to permit the Issuers or any
Guarantor to obtain DIP Financing secured by a lien on ABL Priority Collateral to be provided by


-----

one or more lenders under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code and/or the use of cash collateral
constituting ABL Priority Collateral under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code (or, in each case,
under any equivalent provision of any other applicable bankruptcy law), then the Controlling
Collateral Agent and the holders of Non-ABL Obligations agree not to object to any such
financing or to the Liens on the ABL Priority Collateral securing the same or to any use of such
cash collateral that constitutes ABL Priority Collateral, unless the Senior ABL Credit Agreement
Collateral Agent shall then oppose or object to such financing or such liens or use of such cash
collateral that constitutes ABL Priority Collateral, or to request adequate protection (except as
otherwise permitted under the ABL/Fixed Asset Intercreditor Agreement) or any other relief in
connection therewith (and (i) to the extent that such DIP Financing liens are senior to the Liens on
any such ABL Priority Collateral for the benefit of the Senior ABL Priority Secured Parties, each
Equal Priority Secured Party and Junior Lien Secured Party will subordinate its Liens with respect
to such ABL Priority Collateral on the same terms as the Liens of the Equal Priority Secured
Parties (other than any Liens of any Senior ABL Priority Secured Party constituting DIP financing
liens) are subordinated thereto, and (ii) to the extent that such DIP Financing liens rank on an
equal priority basis with the Liens on any such ABL Priority Collateral granted to secure the
Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations of the Senior ABL Priority Secured Parties, each Equal
Priority Secured Party and Junior Lien Secured Party will confirm the priorities with respect to
such ABL Priority Collateral as set forth in the ABL/ Fixed Asset Intercreditor Agreement), in
each case so long as:

(1) the Equal Priority Secured Parties and Junior Lien Secured Parties retain the benefit of
their Liens on all such ABL Priority Collateral pledged to the DIP Lenders, including
proceeds thereof arising after the commencement of such proceeding (other than any
Liens constituting DIP Financing Liens) as existed prior to the commencement of such
insolvency or liquidation proceeding;

(2) the Equal Priority Secured Parties and Junior Lien Secured Parties are granted junior
Liens on any additional ABL Priority Collateral pledged to any Senior ABL Priority
Secured Party as adequate protection or otherwise in connection with such DIP financing
or use of such cash collateral; and

(3) any lien on the Fixed Asset Priority Collateral to secure such DIP Financing is
subordinate to the Lien of the Equal Priority Secured Parties and Junior Lien Secured
Parties with respect thereto.

(B) the Controlling Collateral Agent and the holders of Non-ABL Obligations will not object to and
will not otherwise contest (i) any motion for relief from the automatic stay in Section 362 of the
Bankruptcy Code or under any equivalent provision of any other applicable bankruptcy law or
from any injunction against foreclosure or enforcement in respect of the Senior ABL Revolving
Credit Obligations made by the Senior ABL Credit Agreement Collateral Agent or any holder of
such Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations with respect to the ABL Priority Collateral,
(ii) any lawful exercise by any holder of Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations of the right to
credit bid under Section 363(k) of the Bankruptcy Code or under any equivalent provision of any
other applicable bankruptcy to bid Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations in any sale in
foreclosure of ABL Priority Collateral securing such Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations;
(iii) any other request for judicial relief made in any court by any holder of Senior ABL Revolving
Credit Obligations relating to the lawful enforcement of any Lien on the ABL Priority Collateral;
(iv) any sale or other disposition of any ABL Priority Collateral (or any portion thereof) under
Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code or any other provision of the Bankruptcy Code or under any
equivalent provision of any other applicable bankruptcy law if the Senior ABL Credit Agreement
Collateral Agent or the holders of Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations shall have consented
to such sale or disposition of the ABL Priority Collateral; and (v) any order relating to a sale of
assets constituting ABL Priority Collateral for which the Senior ABL Credit Agreement Collateral
Agent has consented which provides that, to the extent the sale is to be free and clear of Liens, the
Liens securing the Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations and the Non-ABL Obligations will


-----

attach to the proceeds of the sale on the same basis of priority as the Liens securing such
Obligations on the assets being sold, in accordance with the ABL/Fixed Asset Intercreditor
Agreement;

(C) the Controlling Collateral Agent and the holders of Non-ABL Obligations will not seek relief from
the automatic stay in Section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code or under any equivalent provision of
any other applicable bankruptcy law or any other stay in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding
with respect to the ABL Priority Collateral without the prior consent of the Senior ABL Credit
Agreement Collateral Agent or oppose any request by the Senior ABL Credit Agreement
Collateral Agent for relief from such stay with respect to the ABL Priority Collateral Agent and
the holders of Non-ABL Obligations will not object to and will not otherwise contest (or support
any other person contesting) (a) any request by the Senior ABL Credit Agreement Collateral
Agent or the holders of Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations for adequate protection with
respect to the ABL Priority Collateral or (b) any objection by the Senior ABL Credit Agreement
Collateral Agent or the holders of Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations to any motion, relief,
action or proceeding based on the Senior ABL Credit Agreement Collateral Agent or the holders
of Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations claiming a lack of adequate protection with respect
to the ABL Priority Collateral. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in any insolvency or liquidation
proceeding, (i) if the holders of Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations (or any subset thereof)
are granted adequate protection with respect to ABL Priority Collateral in the form of additional
collateral in connection with any DIP Financing or use of cash collateral under Section 363 or
Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code or under any equivalent provision of any other applicable
Bankruptcy Law, then each Collateral Agent for any series of Non-ABL Obligations may seek or
request adequate protection in the form of a replacement Lien on such additional collateral, so
long as such Lien is subordinated to the Liens on the ABL Priority Collateral securing the Senior
ABL Revolving Credit Obligations and such DIP Financing (and all Obligations relating thereto),
on the same basis as the other Liens on ABL Priority Collateral securing the Non-ABL
Obligations are subordinated to the Liens on ABL Priority Collateral securing the Senior ABL
Revolving Credit Obligations under the ABL/Fixed Asset Intercreditor Agreement and (ii) in the
event a Collateral Agent for any series of Non-ABL Obligations seeks or requests adequate
protection and such adequate protection is granted in the form of additional collateral, then the
Controlling Collateral Agent and the holders of Non-ABL Obligations agree that the holders of the
Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations shall also be granted a Lien on such additional
collateral as security for the Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations and any such DIP
Financing and that any Lien on such additional collateral that constitutes ABL Priority Collateral
securing the Non-ABL Obligations shall be subordinated to the Liens on such collateral securing
the Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations and any such DIP Financing (and all Obligations
relating thereto) and any other Liens on ABL Priority Collateral granted to the holders of Senior
ABL Revolving Credit Obligations as adequate protection on the same basis as the Non-ABL
Liens are so subordinated to the Liens securing the Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations
under the ABL/Fixed Asset Intercreditor Agreement; and

(D) no non-Senior ABL Credit Agreement Collateral Agent nor any other Equal Priority Secured Party
or Junior Lien Secured Party shall (i) oppose or seek to challenge any claim by the Senior ABL
Credit Agreement Collateral Agent or any holder of Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations for
allowance of Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations consisting of post-petition interest, fees or
expenses to the extent of the value of the Senior ABL Credit Agreement Collateral Agent’s Lien
on the ABL Priority Collateral, without regard to the existence of the Lien of the Equal Priority
Secured Parties and Junior Lien Secured Parties on the ABL Priority Collateral or (ii) until the
discharge of Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations has occurred, assert or enforce any claim
under Section 506(c) of the Bankruptcy Code or under any equivalent provision of any other
applicable Bankruptcy Law senior or on parity with the Liens on the ABL Priority Collateral
securing the Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations for costs or expenses of preserving or
disposing of any Collateral.


-----

The ABL/Fixed Asset Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the provisions of it are intended to be and
shall be enforceable under Section 510(a) of the Bankruptcy Code or under any equivalent provision of any other
applicable Bankruptcy Law.

The ABL/Fixed Asset Intercreditor Agreement will also contain similar reciprocal restrictions on the Senior
ABL Credit Agreement Collateral Agent and the holders of Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations applicable
during an insolvency or liquidation proceeding.

The ABL/Fixed Asset Intercreditor Agreement will also provide for customary access and use of the Fixed
Asset Priority Collateral for purposes of exercising remedies with respect to the ABL Priority Collateral, and that the
Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations and the Non-ABL Obligations shall be deemed separate classes of
secured obligations.

For the avoidance of doubt, the assets of any ABL Non-U.S. Guarantors will not be subject to the
ABL/Fixed Asset Intercreditor Agreement unless such ABL Non-U.S. Guarantor is also a guarantor for the Equal
Priority Obligations.

**_Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement_**

If the Issuers or any of the Guarantors were to incur Indebtedness secured by the Collateral with a Junior
Lien Priority relative to the Notes (other than Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations), the Bank Collateral
Agent, the Existing Notes Collateral Agent, the Notes Collateral Agent and the applicable Junior Lien Collateral
Agent will enter into an intercreditor agreement (as the same may be amended from time to time, the “Junior Lien
**_Intercreditor Agreement”). Such Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement would be entered into without the consent of_**
the Holders. The Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement may be amended from time to time without the consent of the
Holders to add other parties holding Junior Lien Obligations and Equal Priority Obligations permitted to be incurred
under the then extant relevant agreements, or their respective representatives.

Notwithstanding the date, time, manner or order of filing or recordation of any document or instrument or
grant, attachment or perfection of any Liens granted to the Junior Lien Collateral Agent or any Junior Lien Secured
Parties on the Collateral or of any Liens granted to any Equal Priority Secured Parties on the Collateral (or any
actual or alleged defect in any of the foregoing) and notwithstanding any provision of the Uniform Commercial
Code, any applicable law, any Junior Lien Documents or any Equal Priority Documents or any other circumstance
whatsoever, the Junior Lien Collateral Agent and each other Junior Lien Representative, in each case on behalf of
itself and each Junior Lien Secured Party under its Junior Lien Documents, will agree that any Lien on the Collateral
securing or purporting to secure any Equal Priority Obligations now or hereafter held by or on behalf of any Equal
Priority Secured Parties or other representative, agent or trustee therefor, regardless of how acquired, whether by
grant, statute, operation of law, subrogation or otherwise, shall have priority over and be senior in all respects and
prior to any Lien on the Collateral securing or purporting to secure any Junior Lien Obligations.

Pursuant to the terms of the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement, except as provided below, prior to the
Discharge of Equal Priority Obligations, the Controlling Collateral Agent or any person authorized by it will have
the exclusive right to exercise any right or remedy with respect to the Collateral and will also have the exclusive
right to determine and direct the time, method and place for exercising such right or remedy or conducting any
proceeding with respect thereto.

The Junior Lien Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of each Junior Lien Secured Party, will agree
pursuant to the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement that it will not (and will waive any right to) take any action to,
contest or support any other Person in contesting, in any proceeding (including any insolvency or liquidation
proceeding), the validity, extent, perfection, priority or enforceability of a Lien securing, or the allowability of any
claim asserted with respect to, any Equal Priority Obligations held (or purported to be held) by or on behalf of the
Controlling Collateral Agent or any of the Equal Priority Secured Parties or any agent or trustee therefor in any
Collateral or other collateral securing both the Equal Priority Obligations and any Junior Lien Obligations. The
Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement will provide for a reciprocal restriction on the ability of any Equal Priority
Collateral Agent to contest or support any other Person in contesting, in any proceeding (including any insolvency


-----

or liquidation proceeding), the validity, extent, perfection, priority or enforceability of any Lien securing, or the
allowability of any claim asserted with respect to, any Junior Lien Obligations held (or purported to be held) by or
on behalf of the Junior Lien Collateral Agent or any of the Junior Lien Secured Parties in the Collateral securing the
Junior Lien Obligations; provided that such restriction will not limit the ability of the Equal Priority Collateral Agent
to enforce the terms of the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement.

The Collateral or proceeds thereof received in connection with the sale or other disposition of, or collection
on, such Collateral upon the exercise of remedies or in any bankruptcy proceeding will be applied to the Equal
Priority Obligations prior to application to any Junior Lien Obligations in such order as specified in the relevant
Equal Priority Documents until the Discharge of Equal Priority Obligations has occurred.

In addition, so long as the Discharge of Equal Priority Obligations has not occurred, none of the Grantors
shall grant or permit any additional Liens on any asset or property of any Grantor to secure any Junior Lien
Obligations unless it has granted, or concurrently therewith grants, a Lien on such asset or property of such Grantor
to secure the Equal Priority Obligations. If the Junior Lien Collateral Agent or any Junior Lien Secured Party holds
or acquires any Lien on any assets or property of the Issuer or any Subsidiary securing any Junior Lien Obligations
that are not also subject to the senior priority Liens securing Equal Priority Obligations under the Equal Priority
Documents, the Junior Lien Collateral Agent or such Junior Lien Secured Party (i) will be obligated to notify the
Controlling Collateral Agent promptly upon becoming aware thereof and, unless such Grantor shall promptly grant a
similar Lien on such assets or property to the Collateral Agents as security for the Equal Priority Obligations, must
assign such Lien to the Equal Priority Collateral Agents as security for the Equal Priority Obligations (but may
retain a junior lien on such assets or property subject to the terms of the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement) and
(ii) until such assignment or such grant of a similar Lien to the Equal Priority Collateral Agents, will be deemed to
also hold and have held such Lien for the benefit of the Equal Priority Collateral Agents as security for the Equal
Priority Obligations. Any amounts received by or distributed to any Junior Lien Secured Party pursuant to or as a
result of any Lien granted in contravention of the foregoing shall be subject to the turnover and related provisions of
the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement.

If any Equal Priority Secured Party is required in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding or otherwise to
disgorge, turn over or otherwise pay to the estate of the Issuers or any Guarantor (or any trustee, receiver or similar
person therefor), because the payment of such amount was declared to be, or otherwise avoided as, fraudulent or
preferential in any respect or for any other reason, any amount (a “Recovery”), whether received as proceeds of
security, enforcement of any right of setoff, recoupment or otherwise, then the Equal Priority Obligations shall be
reinstated to the extent of such Recovery and deemed to be outstanding as if such payment had not occurred and the
Equal Priority Secured Parties shall be entitled to a future Discharge of Equal Priority Obligations with respect to all
such recovered amounts. If the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement shall have been terminated prior to such
Recovery, the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement shall be reinstated in full force and effect, and such prior
termination shall not diminish, release, discharge, impair or otherwise affect the obligations of the parties thereto.
The Junior Lien Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of each Junior Lien Secured Party will agree that none of
them shall be entitled to benefit from any avoidance action affecting or otherwise relating to any distribution or
allocation made in accordance with the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement, whether by preference or otherwise, it
being understood and agreed that the benefit of such avoidance action otherwise allocable to them shall instead be
allocated and turned over for application in accordance with the priorities set forth in the Junior Lien Intercreditor
Agreement.

The Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement will provide that so long as the Discharge of Equal Priority
Obligations has not occurred, whether or not any insolvency or liquidation proceeding has been commenced by or
against the Issuers or any Guarantor, (i) neither the Junior Lien Collateral Agent nor any Junior Lien Secured Party
will (x) exercise or seek to exercise any rights or remedies (including setoff or recoupment) with respect to any
collateral securing both the Equal Priority Obligations and any Junior Lien Obligations, or institute any action or
proceeding with respect to such rights or remedies (including any action of foreclosure), (y) contest, protest or object
to any foreclosure proceeding or action brought with respect to the Collateral or any other collateral by the
Controlling Collateral Agent or any Equal Priority Secured Party in respect of the Equal Priority Obligations, the
exercise of any right by the Controlling Collateral Agent or any Equal Priority Secured Party (or any agent or subagent on their behalf) in respect of the Equal Priority Obligations under any lockbox agreement, control agreement,
landlord waiver or bailee’s letter or similar agreement or arrangement to which the Controlling Collateral Agent or


-----

any Equal Priority Secured Party either is a party or may have rights as a third-party beneficiary, or any other
exercise by any such party of any rights and remedies relating to such collateral or any other collateral under the
Equal Priority Documents or otherwise in respect of Equal Priority Obligations, or (z) object to any forbearance by
the Equal Priority Secured Parties from bringing or pursuing any foreclosure proceeding or action or any other
exercise of any rights or remedies relating to such collateral or any other collateral in respect of Equal Priority
Obligations and (ii) except as otherwise provided in the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement, the Controlling
Collateral Agent and the Equal Priority Secured Parties shall have the exclusive right to enforce rights, exercise
remedies (including setoff, recoupment, and the right to credit bid their debt), and make determinations regarding
the release, disposition or restrictions with respect to such collateral without any consultation with or the consent of
the Junior Lien Collateral Agent or any Junior Lien Secured Party; provided, however, that (a) in any insolvency or
liquidation proceeding, any Junior Lien Representative may file a claim, proof of claim or statement of interest with
respect to the Junior Lien Obligations in a manner consistent with the terms of the Junior Lien Intercreditor
Agreement, (b) any Junior Lien Representative may take any action (not adverse to the prior Liens on the Collateral
securing the Equal Priority Obligations or the rights of the Controlling Collateral Agent or the Equal Priority
Secured Parties to exercise remedies in respect thereof) in order to create, prove, perfect, preserve or protect (but not
enforce) its rights in, and perfection and priority of its Lien on, the Collateral, (c) to the extent not otherwise
inconsistent with or prohibited by the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement, any Junior Lien Representative and the
Junior Lien Secured Parties may exercise their rights and remedies as unsecured creditors, as provided in the Junior
Lien Intercreditor Agreement, (d) any Junior Lien Representative may exercise the rights and remedies provided for
in the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement with respect to seeking adequate protection in an insolvency or
liquidation proceeding, and (e) any Junior Lien Representative and the Junior Lien Secured Parties may file any
necessary or appropriate responsive or defensive pleadings in opposition to any motion, claim, adversary proceeding
or other pleading made by any person objecting to or otherwise seeking the disallowance of the claims or Liens of
the Junior Lien Secured Parties, including any claims secured by the Collateral, in each case in accordance with the
terms of the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement. In exercising rights and remedies with respect to any collateral
securing both the Equal Priority Obligations and any Junior Lien Obligations, the Controlling Collateral Agent and
the Equal Priority Secured Parties may enforce the provisions of the Equal Priority Documents and exercise
remedies thereunder, all in such order and in such manner as they may determine in the exercise of their sole
discretion. Such exercise and enforcement shall include the rights of an agent appointed by them to sell or otherwise
dispose of Collateral upon foreclosure, to incur expenses in connection with such sale or disposition and to exercise
all the rights and remedies of a secured lender under the Uniform Commercial Code of any applicable jurisdiction
and of a secured creditor under bankruptcy laws of any applicable jurisdiction.

In the event of a sale, transfer or other disposition of any specified item of Collateral (including all or
substantially all of the Equity Interests of any Subsidiary of the Issuer), the Liens granted to the Junior Lien
Representatives and the Junior Lien Secured Parties upon such Collateral to secure Junior Lien Obligations shall
terminate and be released, automatically and without any further action, concurrently with the termination and
release of all Liens granted upon such Collateral to secure Equal Priority Obligations.

The Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the Equal Priority Documents may be amended,
restated, supplemented or otherwise modified in accordance with their terms, and the Indebtedness under the Equal
Priority Documents may be refinanced, in each case, without the consent of any Junior Lien Secured Party.

Without the prior written consent of the Controlling Collateral Agent, no Junior Lien Document may be
amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified, or entered into, and no Indebtedness under the Junior Lien
Document may be refinanced, to the extent such amendment, restatement, supplement or modification or
refinancing, or the terms of such new Junior Lien Document, would (i) contravene the provisions of the Junior Lien
Intercreditor Agreement, (ii) change to earlier dates any scheduled dates for payment of principal (including the final
maturity date) or of interest on Indebtedness under such Junior Lien Document or (iii) reduce the capacity to incur
Indebtedness for borrowed money constituting Equal Priority Obligations to an amount less than the aggregate
principal amount of term loans or outstanding notes and aggregate principal amount of revolving commitments, in
each case, under the Equal Priority Documents on the day of any such amendment, restatement, supplement,
modification or refinancing.


-----

The Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the provisions of it are intended to be and shall
be enforceable under Section 510(a) of the Bankruptcy Code or under any equivalent provision of any other
applicable Bankruptcy Law.

_Certain Matters in Connection with Liquidation and Insolvency Proceedings_

Debtor-in-Possession Financings

The Junior Lien Collateral Agent and each other Junior Lien Secured Party will agree, among other things,
that if the Issuers or any Guarantor is subject to any insolvency or liquidation proceeding and the Controlling
Collateral Agent or any other Equal Priority Secured Party desires to permit (or not object to) the use of cash
collateral under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code or any other similar provision of the Bankruptcy Code or other
applicable bankruptcy law and/or to permit the Issuers or any Guarantor to obtain DIP Financing under Section 364
of the Bankruptcy Code or any other similar provision of the Bankruptcy Code or other applicable bankruptcy law to
be secured by any collateral securing both the Equal Priority Obligations and any Junior Lien Obligations, then each
Junior Lien Representative, on behalf of itself and each applicable Junior Lien Secured Party, will not object to such
use of cash collateral and/or DIP Financing and will not request adequate protection or any other relief in connection
therewith (except to the extent permitted by the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement) and, to the extent the Liens
securing the Equal Priority Obligations are subordinated to or on an equal priority basis with respect to such DIP
Financing, will subordinate its Liens in the Collateral and any other collateral to such DIP Financing (and all
obligations relating thereto), any adequate protection Liens granted to the Equal Priority Secured Parties, and any
“carve out” for professional and United States Trustee fees agreed to by the Controlling Collateral Agent, on the
same basis as they are subordinated to the Equal Priority Obligations pursuant to the Junior Lien Intercreditor
Agreement. The Junior Lien Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of each Junior Lien Secured Party, will agree
that notice received two Business Days prior to the entry of an order approving such usage of cash or other collateral
and/or approving such DIP Financing shall be adequate notice.

Relief from Automatic Stay; Bankruptcy Sales

No Junior Lien Secured Party may (x) seek relief from the automatic stay with respect to any Collateral
without the prior written consent of the Controlling Collateral Agent, or object to any motion for relief from the
automatic stay with respect to the Collateral made by the Controlling Collateral Agent, (y) object to any lawful
exercise by any holder of Equal Priority Obligations of the right to credit bid such claims under Section 363(k) of
the Bankruptcy Code or any other similar provision of the Bankruptcy Code or other applicable bankruptcy law, or
to any sale or other disposition of any Collateral that the Controlling Collateral Agent has consented to, provided
that in the case of such a sale, the parties’ respective Liens will attach to the proceeds of such sale on the same basis
of priority as such Liens existed on the Collateral pursuant to the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement or (z) object
to any claim of any holder of Equal Priority Obligations for post-petition interest, fees, costs, expenses or other
charges under Section 506(b) of the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise (for this purpose ignoring all claims and Liens
held by the Junior Lien Secured Parties on the Collateral).

Adequate Protection

Each Junior Lien Representative, for itself and on behalf of each applicable Junior Lien Secured Party, will
agree that none of them shall object to (a) any request by the Controlling Collateral Agent or the Equal Priority
Secured Parties for adequate protection in any form, (b) any objection by the Controlling Collateral Agent or the
Equal Priority Secured Parties to any motion, relief, action, or proceeding based on the Controlling Collateral
Agent’s or the Equal Priority Secured Parties’ claiming a lack of adequate protection, or (c) the allowance and/or
payment of interest, fees, expenses, or other amounts of the Controlling Collateral Agent or the Equal Priority
Secured Parties as adequate protection or otherwise under Section 506(b) or 506(c) of the Bankruptcy Code or any
similar provision of the Bankruptcy Code or any other bankruptcy law. If the Equal Priority Secured Parties (or any
subset thereof) are granted adequate protection in the form of a Lien on additional or replacement collateral and/or a
superpriority administrative expense claim in connection with any DIP Financing or use of cash collateral under
Section 363 or 364 of the Bankruptcy Code, as applicable, or any similar provision of the Bankruptcy Code or any
other bankruptcy law, then each Junior Lien Representative, for itself and on behalf of the applicable Junior Lien
Secured Parties, may seek or request adequate protection in the form of (as applicable) a Lien on such additional or


-----

replacement collateral and/or a superpriority administrative expense claim, which Lien and/or superpriority
administrative expense claim (as applicable) will be subordinated to the Liens securing and providing adequate
protection for, and claims with respect to the Equal Priority Obligations and such DIP Financing (and all obligations
relating thereto), on the same basis as the other Liens securing and claims with respect to the Junior Lien
Obligations are so subordinated to the Liens securing and claims with respect to the Equal Priority Obligations under
the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement and (ii) in the event any Junior Lien Representatives, for themselves and on
behalf of the applicable Junior Lien Secured Parties, seek or request adequate protection and such adequate
protection is granted in the form of (as applicable) a Lien on additional or replacement collateral and/or a
superpriority administrative expense claim, then such Junior Lien Representatives, for themselves and on behalf of
the applicable Junior Lien Secured Parties, agree that the Equal Priority Secured Parties shall also be granted (as
applicable) a senior Lien on such additional or replacement collateral as security and adequate protection for the
Equal Priority Obligations and/or a senior superpriority administrative expense claim, and that any Lien on such
additional or replacement collateral securing or providing adequate protection for the Junior Lien Obligations and/or
superpriority administrative expense claim shall be subordinated to the Liens on such collateral securing and claims
with respect to the Equal Priority Obligations and any such DIP Financing (and all obligations relating thereto) and
any other Liens and claims granted to the Equal Priority Secured Parties as adequate protection on the same basis as
the other Liens securing and claims with respect to the Junior Lien Obligations are so subordinated to such Liens
securing and claims with respect to Equal Priority Obligations under the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement. To the
extent that the Equal Priority Secured Parties are granted adequate protection in the form of payments in the amount
of current post-petition fees and expenses, and/or other cash payments, then the Junior Lien Representatives shall
not be prohibited from seeking adequate protection in the form of payments in the amount of current post-petition
incurred fees and expenses, and/or other cash payments (as applicable), subject to the right of the Equal Priority
Secured Parties to object to the reasonableness of the amounts of fees and expenses or other cash payments so
sought by the Junior Lien Secured Parties.

Plans of Reorganization

No Junior Lien Representative or any other Junior Lien Secured Party (whether in the capacity of a secured
or unsecured creditor) may directly or indirectly propose, support or vote in favor of any plan of reorganization or
similar dispositive restructuring plan that is inconsistent with the priorities or other provisions of the Junior Lien
Intercreditor Agreement, other than with the prior written consent of the Controlling Collateral Agent or to the
extent any such plan is proposed or supported by the class of holders of Equal Priority Obligations required under
Section 1126(c) of the Bankruptcy Code.

Each Junior Lien Representative, for itself and on behalf of each applicable Junior Lien Secured Party, will
acknowledge and agree that (a) the grants of Liens securing the Equal Priority Obligations and the Junior Lien
Obligations constitute separate and distinct grants of Liens and (b) because of, among other things, their differing
rights in the Collateral, the Junior Lien Obligations are fundamentally different from the Equal Priority Obligations
and must be separately classified in any plan of reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan proposed,
confirmed or adopted in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding. To further effectuate the intent of the parties as
provided in the immediately preceding sentence, if it is held that the claims of the Equal Priority Secured Parties and
the Junior Lien Secured Parties in respect of the Collateral constitute only one secured claim (rather than separate
classes of senior and junior secured claims) under a plan of reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan,
then each Junior Lien Representative, for itself and on behalf of the applicable Junior Lien Secured Parties, will
acknowledge and agree that all distributions from the Collateral shall be made as if there were separate classes of
senior and junior secured claims against the Issuers and the Guarantors in respect of the Collateral (with the effect
being that, to the extent that the aggregate value of the Collateral is sufficient (for this purpose ignoring all claims
held by the Junior Lien Secured Parties), the Equal Priority Secured Parties shall be entitled to receive, in addition to
amounts distributed to them in respect of principal, pre-petition interest and other claims, all amounts owing in
respect of post-petition interest, fees, and expenses (whether or not allowed or allowable in such insolvency or
liquidation proceeding) before any distribution is made from the Collateral in respect of the Junior Lien Obligations,
with each Junior Lien Representative, for itself and on behalf of each applicable Junior Lien Secured Party,
acknowledging and agreeing to turn over to the Controlling Collateral Agent amounts otherwise received or
receivable by them from the Collateral to the extent necessary to effectuate the intent of this sentence, even if such
turnover has the effect of reducing the claim or recovery of the Junior Lien Secured Parties.


-----

**Release of Collateral**

The release of property and other assets constituting Collateral from the Liens securing the Notes and the
Equal Priority Obligations shall occur automatically and without further action by the Notes Collateral Agent, the
Trustee or the Holders under any one or more of the following circumstances:

(1) to enable the Issuers and/or one or more Guarantors to consummate the sale, transfer or other
disposition (including by the termination of capital leases or the repossession of the leased
property in a capital lease by the lessor) of such property or assets (to a Person other than a Person
required to grant a Lien on such property or asset to the Notes Collateral Agent under the Security
Documents) to the extent consummated in accordance with, or not prohibited by, the covenant
described under “Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales”;

(2) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Guarantee with respect to the Notes pursuant to
the terms of the Indenture, the release of the Equity Interests in, and property and assets of, such
Guarantor;

(3) all Collateral upon the occurrence of an Investment Grade Event;

(4) the release of Excess Proceeds that remain unexpended after the conclusion of an Asset Sale Offer
conducted in accordance with the Indenture;

(5) (x) if all other liens on such Collateral securing Equal Priority Obligations are released or will be
released simultaneously therewith (other than any release by, or as a result of, payment in full and
irrevocable termination of the Equal Priority Obligations) and (y) in the case of ABL Priority
Collateral securing Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations then outstanding, if the liens on
such ABL Priority Collateral are released or will be released simultaneously therewith by the
Senior ABL Credit Agreement Collateral Agent or otherwise pursuant to the Senior ABL Credit
Agreement (other than any release by, or as a result of, payment in full and irrevocable termination
of the Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations);

(6) if the release of such Lien is approved, authorized or ratified by the Required Holders;

(7) to the extent such property or asset constitutes or becomes an Excluded Asset; or

(8) as described under “Amendment, Supplement and Waiver” below.

The Liens on the Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees also will be released automatically and
without further action by the Notes Collateral Agent, the Trustee or the Holders (i) upon payment in full of the
principal of, together with accrued and unpaid interest on, the Notes and all other Obligations under the Indenture,
the Guarantees and the Security Documents that are due and payable at or prior to the time such principal, together
with accrued and unpaid interest, are paid, (ii) upon a legal defeasance or covenant defeasance under the Indenture
as described below under “Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” or a discharge of the Indenture as described
under “Satisfaction and Discharge” or (iii) pursuant to the Security Documents, the ABL Fixed Asset Intercreditor
Agreement or the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement described above.

Notwithstanding clause (3) above, if, after any Investment Grade Event, both of the Rating Agencies
withdraw their Investment Grade Rating or downgrade the rating assigned to the Notes below an Investment Grade
Rating (or for the avoidance of doubt, only one Rating Agency withdraws its Investment Grade Rating or
downgrades the rating assigned to the applicable Series of Notes below an Investment Grade Rating in the event that
such Rating Agency was the only Rating Agency to give an Investment Grade Rating to such Series of Notes), the
Issuers and the Guarantors shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take all actions reasonably necessary to
provide to the Notes Collateral Agent for its benefit and the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes
valid, perfected, first priority security interests (subject to Permitted Liens) in the Collateral within ninety (90) days
after such Reversion Date or as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter.


-----

With respect to any release of Collateral, upon receipt of an Officer’s Certificate in compliance with the
Indenture, the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, shall execute, deliver or acknowledge (at the
Issuers’ expense) any instruments or releases reasonably requested by the Issuers to evidence the release of any
Collateral permitted to be released pursuant to the Indenture or the Equal Priority Documents related thereto or the
Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement. Neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent shall be liable for any
such release undertaken in reliance upon any such Officer’s Certificate.

**_Sufficiency of Collateral_**

The fair market value of the Collateral is subject to fluctuations based on factors that include, among
others, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, general economic conditions, the availability of buyers and
similar factors. The amount to be received upon a sale of the Collateral would also be dependent on numerous
factors, including, but not limited to, the actual fair market value of the Collateral at such time and the timing and
the manner of the sale. By their nature, portions of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily
ascertainable market value. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Collateral can be sold in a short period
of time or in an orderly manner. In addition, as discussed further below, the Holders of the Notes will not be entitled
to receive post-petition interest or applicable fees, costs, expenses, or charges to the extent the amount of the
obligations due under the Notes exceeds the value of the Collateral (after taking into account all other first- priority
debt that is also secured by the Collateral), or any “adequate protection” on account of any undersecured portion of
the Notes.

**_Certain Bankruptcy Limitations_**

The right of the Notes Collateral Agent to foreclose upon, repossess and dispose of the Collateral upon the
occurrence of an Event of Default would be significantly impaired by any bankruptcy law in the event that any
bankruptcy case or other insolvency or liquidation proceeding were to be commenced by or against the Issuers or
any Guarantor prior to the Notes Collateral Agent’s having repossessed and disposed of the Collateral (and in some
cases, even after). Upon the commencement of a case for relief under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, a secured creditor
such as the Notes Collateral Agent is prohibited from foreclosing upon or repossessing its security from a debtor in a
bankruptcy case, or from disposing of previously repossessed security without prior bankruptcy court approval
(which may not be given under the circumstances).

In view of the broad equitable powers of a U.S. bankruptcy court and the lack of a precise definition of the
meaning of “adequate protection,” it is impossible to predict whether or when payments under the Notes could be
made following the commencement of a bankruptcy case (or the length of the delay in making any such payments),
whether or when the Notes Collateral Agent could or would repossess or dispose of the Collateral, the value of the
Collateral at any time during a bankruptcy case or whether or to what extent Holders of the Notes would be
compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the Collateral. The U.S. Bankruptcy Code permits the
payment and/or accrual of post-petition interest, expenses, costs and attorneys’ fees to a secured creditor during a
debtor’s bankruptcy case only to the extent the value of such creditor’s interest in the Collateral is determined by the
bankruptcy court to exceed the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the obligations secured by the Collateral.

Furthermore, in the event a domestic or foreign bankruptcy court determines that the value of the Collateral
is not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes, the Holders of the Notes would hold secured claims only to
the extent of the value of the Collateral to which the Holders of the Notes are entitled, and unsecured “deficiency”
claims with respect to such shortfall, which deficiency claims would not need to be adequately protected during a
bankruptcy case.

**Escrow of Gross Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption**

If the Issue Date occurs prior to the consummation of the Seller Notes Repurchase, concurrently with the
closing of the offering of the Notes on the Issue Date, the Issuers will enter into an escrow agreement (the “Escrow
**_Agreement”) with the Trustee and U.S. Bank National Association and/or another nationally recognized financial_**
institution chosen by the Issuer in its reasonable discretion, as escrow agent (in such capacity, the “Escrow Agent”),
pursuant to which the Issuer will deposit (or cause to be deposited) the gross proceeds of the offering of the Notes


-----

into the Escrow Account. The ability of the Holders of the Notes to realize upon such funds or securities held in the
Escrow Account may be subject to certain bankruptcy law limitations in the event of a bankruptcy of the Issuers.

The Issuer will only be entitled to direct the Escrow Agent to release the funds held in the Escrow Account in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. Pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Agent will
release funds held in the Escrow Account (the “Release”) to, or at the order of, the Issuer (the date of such release
being referred to as the “Escrow Release Date”) upon delivery by the Issuer to the Escrow Agent and the Trustee of
an Officer’s Certificate addressed to the Escrow Agent and the Trustee on or prior to December 31, 2024 (the
“Outside Date”), certifying that the following conditions (collectively, the “Escrow Conditions”) will be met
substantially concurrently with or promptly following the Release on the Escrow Release Date: (A) the funds held in
the Escrow Account will be used to consummate, or in connection with the consummation or financing of, the Seller
Notes Repurchase, (B) the Seller Notes Repurchase will be consummated substantially concurrently with the release
of the funds from the Escrow Account and (C) the conditions precedent to the funding under the New Term Loan B
Facility shall have been, or substantially concurrently shall be, satisfied or waived in all material respects; provided
that the Outside Date will be extended if the Closing Deadline (as defined therein) pursuant to the Notes Purchase
Agreement is extended by the parties.

In the event that (a) the Escrow Agent has not received the Officer’s Certificate described above on or prior to
the Outside Date, (b) the Issuer shall notify the Escrow Agent in writing that in its reasonable judgment the Seller
Notes Repurchase will not be consummated on or prior to the Outside Date or (c) the Issuer shall notify the Escrow
Agent in writing that the Note Purchase Agreement has been terminated (each such event described in clauses (a),
(b) and (c) above being a “Mandatory Redemption Event”), the Issuers will redeem the Notes (the “Special
**_Mandatory Redemption”) at a price (the “Special Mandatory Redemption Price”) equal to 100.0% of the issue_**
price of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest from the Issue Date, or from the most recent date to which
interest has been paid or provided for, to, but not including, the date of such redemption (the “Special Mandatory
**_Redemption Date”), which shall be the third Business Day following the Mandatory Redemption Event (or such_**
date as may be required by the procedures of DTC). On or prior to the Special Mandatory Redemption Date, funds
will be liquidated and released from the Escrow Account in order to consummate the Special Mandatory
Redemption.

By its acceptance of the Notes, each Holder shall be deemed to authorize and direct the Trustee to enter
into and perform its obligations under, if any, the Escrow Agreement.

**Mandatory Redemption; Offers to Purchase; Open Market Purchases**

Except as described under “—Escrow of Gross Proceeds; Mandatory Redemption,” the Issuers will not be
required to make any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payment with respect to the Notes. However, under
certain circumstances, the Issuers may be required to offer to purchase Notes as described under the caption “—
Repurchase at the Option of Holders.” As market conditions warrant, we and our direct and indirect equityholders,
including the Investors, their respective Affiliates and members of our management, may from time to time seek to
purchase our outstanding debt securities or loans, including the Notes, in privately negotiated or open market
transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. Subject to any applicable limitations contained in the agreements
governing our indebtedness, including the Indenture, any purchases made by us may be funded by the use of cash on
our balance sheet or the incurrence of new secured or unsecured debt, including borrowings under our credit
facilities, or through other sources. The amounts involved in any such purchase transactions, individually or in the
aggregate, may be material. Any such purchases may be with respect to a substantial amount of a particular class or
series of debt, with the attendant reduction in the trading liquidity of such class or series. In addition, any such
purchases made at prices below the “adjusted issue price” of the Notes (as defined for U.S. federal income tax
purposes) may result in taxable cancellation of indebtedness income to us, which amounts may be material, and in
related adverse tax consequences to us.

**Optional Redemption**

Except as set forth below, the Issuers will not be entitled to redeem the Notes at their option prior to     ,
2027. Prior to     , 2027, the Issuers may, at their option, at any time and from time to time, redeem all or a part
of the Notes, upon notice as described under “—Selection and Notice,” at a redemption price equal to 100% of the


-----

principal amount of the Notes redeemed plus the Applicable Premium as of, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any,
to, but excluding, the date of redemption (the “Redemption Date”), subject to the right of Holders of record on the
relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling prior to or on the
Redemption Date.

On and after     , 2027, the Issuers may, at their option, at any time and from time to time, redeem all or
a part of the Notes, upon notice as described under “—Selection and Notice,” at the redemption prices (expressed as
percentages of principal amount of the applicable Series of Notes to be redeemed) set forth below, plus accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, thereon to, but excluding, the applicable Redemption Date, subject to the right of Holders of
record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling prior to or on
the Redemption Date, if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on      of each of the years
indicated below:

**Redemption**

**Year** **Price**

2027 ............................................................................................................... %
2028 ............................................................................................................... %
2029 and thereafter ........................................................................................ 100.000%

In addition, prior to     , 2027, the Issuers may, at their option, at any time and from time to time,
redeem an aggregate principal amount of Notes with an amount not to exceed the amount of the Net Cash Proceeds
received by an Issuer from one or more Equity Offerings or a capital contribution to an Issuer made with the Net
Cash Proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings, upon notice as described under “—Selection and Notice,” at a
redemption price equal to (i)      % of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes redeemed, plus (ii) accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the Redemption Date, subject to the right of Holders of record on the
relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling prior to or on the
Redemption Date; provided that (1) the amount redeemed shall not exceed 40% of the aggregate principal amount of
the Notes issued under the Indenture (including any Additional Notes); (2) at least the lesser of (x) 50% of the
aggregate principal amount of the Notes originally issued under the Indenture on the Issue Date and (y)
$300.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes remains outstanding immediately after the occurrence of
each such redemption (unless, in either case, all Notes are redeemed or repurchased or to be redeemed or
repurchased substantially concurrently); and (3) each such redemption occurs within 270 days of the date of closing
of the applicable Equity Offering.

In addition, at any time on or prior to     , 2027, the Issuers may, at their option and on one or more
occasions, redeem up to 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes issued under the Indenture (including
any Additional Notes) during each calendar year commencing with the calendar year in which the Issue Date occurs,
upon notice as described under “—Selection and Notice,” at a redemption price equal to 103.000% of the principal
amount of the Notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable
Redemption Date, subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the
relevant interest payment date falling prior to or on the Redemption Date; provided that in any given calendar year,
any amount not utilized pursuant to this paragraph in any calendar year may be carried forward to subsequent
calendar years.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer, Change of Control Offer, Alternate
Offer or Asset Sale Offer for the Notes, if Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the then
outstanding Notes validly tender and do not validly withdraw such Notes in such offer and the Issuers, or any third
party making such offer in lieu of the Issuers, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn
by such Holders, the Issuers or such third party will have the right upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’
prior notice, given not more than 60 days following such purchase date, to redeem all Notes that remain outstanding
following such purchase at a price equal to the price offered to each other Holder in such offer (which may be less
than par and excluding any early tender or incentive fee in such offer) plus, to the extent not included in the offer
payment, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, the Redemption Date, subject to the right of
Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling


-----

prior to or on the Redemption Date. In determining whether the Holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal
amount of the then outstanding Notes have validly tendered and not validly withdrawn Notes in a tender offer,
Change of Control Offer, Alternate Offer or Asset Sale Offer, as applicable, Notes owned by an Affiliate of the
Issuers or by funds controlled or managed by any Affiliate of the Issuers, or any successor thereof, or any Debt Fund
Affiliate, shall be deemed to be outstanding for the purposes of such tender offer, Change of Control Offer,
Alternate Offer or Asset Sale Offer, as applicable.

Notice of any redemption or offer to purchase, whether in connection with an Equity Offering, Change of
Control, Alternate Offer, Asset Sale Offer or other transaction or event or otherwise, may, at the Issuers’ (or, in the
case of a Change of Control Offer, a third party making such Change of Control Offer) discretion, be given prior to
the completion or occurrence thereof, and any such redemption, offer to purchase or notice may, at the Issuers’ (or,
in the case of a Change of Control Offer, a third party making such Change of Control Offer) discretion, be subject
to one or more conditions precedent (including conditions precedent applicable to different amounts of Notes
redeemed), including, but not limited to, completion or occurrence of the related Equity Offering, Change of
Control, Asset Sale or other transaction or event, as the case may be. The Issuers may redeem Notes pursuant to one
or more of the relevant provisions in the Indenture, and a single notice of redemption may be delivered with respect
to redemptions made pursuant to different provisions. Any such notice may provide that redemptions made pursuant
to different provisions may have different Redemption Dates or may specify the order in which redemptions taking
place on the same Redemption Date are deemed to occur. In addition, if such redemption or offer to purchase is
subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice shall state that, in the Issuers’ (or, in the case
of a Change of Control Offer, a third party making such Change of Control Offer) discretion, the redemption or
repurchase date may be delayed until such time (including more than 60 days after the date the notice of redemption
or offer to purchase was sent) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied (or waived by the Issuer (or, in the case
of a Change of Control Offer, a third party making such Change of Control Offer) in its sole discretion), or such
redemption or purchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions
shall not have been satisfied (or waived by the Issuers (or, in the case of a Change of Control Offer, a third party
making such Change of Control Offer) in its sole discretion) by the redemption or purchase date, or by the
redemption or purchase date so delayed, or that such notice or offer may be rescinded at any time in the Issuers’ (or,
in the case of a Change of Control Offer, a third party making such Change of Control Offer) sole discretion. In
addition, the Issuers may provide in such notice or offer to purchase that payment of the redemption or purchase
price and performance of the Issuer’s obligations with respect to such redemption or offer to purchase may be
performed by another Person.

The Issuers, Holdings, their direct and indirect equityholders, including the Investors, any of their
Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates and members of our management may acquire the Notes by means other
than a redemption, whether by tender offer, open market purchases, negotiated transactions or otherwise.

**Selection and Notice**

If the Issuers are redeeming or purchasing less than all of the Notes issued under the Indenture at any time,
selection of the Notes to be redeemed or purchased will be made on a pro rata basis or by lot in accordance with the
applicable procedures of DTC; provided that no Notes in denominations of $2,000 or less can be redeemed or
purchased in part.

Notices of redemption or purchase shall be delivered electronically or mailed by first-class mail, postage
prepaid, at least 10 days (except as set forth in the sixth paragraph under “—Optional Redemption” or in connection
with a special mandatory redemption described under “—Escrow of Gross Proceeds; Mandatory Redemption”) but
not more than 60 days (except as set forth in the sixth paragraph under “—Optional Redemption”) before the
redemption date to each Holder of the Notes at such Holder’s registered address or otherwise in accordance with the
procedures of DTC, with a copy to the Trustee and the paying agent, except that redemption notices may be
delivered more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance or a
satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture with respect to the Notes. The Issuer may provide in any redemption or
purchase notice that payment of the redemption price and the performance of the Issuer’s obligations with respect to
such redemption or purchase may be performed by another Person. If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, any
notice of redemption that relates to such Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof that has been or
is to be redeemed.


-----

With respect to Notes represented by certificated notes, the Issuer will issue a new Note in a principal
amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the original Note in the name of the Holder upon cancellation of the
original Note; provided that new Notes will only be issued in minimum denominations of $2,000 and integral
multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. Notes called for redemption or purchase become due on the date fixed for
redemption or purchase, unless such redemption or purchase is conditioned on the happening of a future event. On
and after the Redemption Date or purchase date, unless the Issuers default in the payment of the redemption or
purchase price, interest ceases to accrue on the Notes called for redemption or purchase.

**Repurchase at the Option of Holders**

**_Change of Control Triggering Event_**

The Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs after the Issue Date, unless
the Issuer has previously or concurrently sent a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Notes as
described under “—Optional Redemption,” the Issuers will make an offer to purchase all of the Notes pursuant to
the offer described below (the “Change of Control Offer”) at a price in cash (the “Change of Control Payment”)
equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding,
the date of purchase, subject to the right of Holders of the Notes of record on the relevant record date to receive
interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling prior to or on the purchase date. Within 60 days following
any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Issuer will send (or cause to be sent) notice of such Change of Control
Offer electronically or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee and the paying agent, to each Holder of Notes
to the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of
DTC, with the following information:

(1) that a Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to the covenant entitled “Change of Control
Triggering Event,” and that all Notes properly tendered pursuant to such Change of Control Offer
will be accepted for payment by the Issuers;

(2) the purchase price and the purchase date, which will be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60
days from the date such notice is sent (the “Change of Control Payment Date”), except in the
case of a conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering
Event as described below;

(3) that any Note not properly tendered will remain outstanding and continue to accrue interest;

(4) that unless the Issuers default in the payment of the Change of Control Payment, all Notes
accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest on the
Change of Control Payment Date;

(5) that Holders electing to have any Notes purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will be
required to surrender such Notes, with the form entitled “Option of Holder to Elect Purchase” on
the reverse of such Notes completed or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC, to
the paying agent specified in the notice at the address specified in the notice prior to the close of
business on the third Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date;

(6) that Holders whose Notes are being purchased only in part will be issued new Notes and such new
Notes will be equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered. The
unpurchased portion of the Notes must be equal to at least $2,000 or any integral multiple of
$1,000 in excess thereof;

(7) if such notice is delivered prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event, stating
that the Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control
Triggering Event and shall describe each such condition, and, if applicable, shall state that, in the
Issuer’s discretion, the Change of Control Payment Date may be delayed until such time
(including more than 60 days after the notice is sent) as any or all such conditions shall be


-----

satisfied or waived, or that such repurchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the
event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied or waived by the Change of
Control Payment Date, or by the Change of Control Payment Date as so delayed, or such notice or
offer may be rescinded at any time in the Issuer’s sole discretion if the Issuer determines that any
or all of such conditions will not be satisfied or waived;

(8) any other instructions, as determined by the Issuer, consistent with this Change of Control
Triggering Event covenant, that a Holder must follow; and

(9) that Holders will be entitled to withdraw their tendered Notes and their election to require the
Issuers to purchase such Notes; provided that the paying agent receives, not later than the close of
business on the tenth Business Day prior to the expiration date of the Change of Control Offer, a
facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of the holder of the Notes, the principal
amount of Notes tendered for purchase, and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing its
tendered Notes, or a specified portion thereof, and its election to have such Notes purchased.

While the Notes are in global form and the Issuers make an offer to purchase all of the Notes pursuant to
the Change of Control Offer, a Holder may exercise its option to elect for the purchase of the Notes or withdraw
such election through the facilities of DTC, subject to its rules and regulations.

The Issuers will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other
securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with
the repurchase of Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities
laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuers will comply with the applicable
securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached their obligations described in the Indenture
by virtue thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuers may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC
indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies
certain conditions.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuers will, to the extent permitted by law:

(1) accept for payment all Notes issued by it or portions thereof validly tendered pursuant to the
Change of Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the aggregate Change of Control Payment in
respect of all Notes or portions thereof so tendered and not validly withdrawn; and

(3) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee for cancellation the Notes so accepted together
with an Officer’s Certificate stating that such Notes or portions thereof have been tendered to and
purchased by the Issuers.

The Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Senior ABL Credit Agreement provide, and future credit
agreements or other agreements relating to Indebtedness to which the Issuers (or one of its Affiliates) become a
party may provide, that certain change of control events with respect to the Issuers would constitute a default
thereunder (which may include a Change of Control or a Change of Control Triggering Event under the Indenture).
In addition, the indenture governing the Existing Notes contain a change of control provision that provides for a put
right upon the occurrence of a “change of control triggering event” (defined in a manner similar to “Change of
Control Triggering Event” as defined herein). If we experience a change of control event that triggers a default
under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Senior ABL Credit Agreement, the Existing Notes or any such future
Indebtedness, we could seek a waiver of such default or seek to refinance the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the
Senior ABL Credit Agreement and/or such future Indebtedness or results in a requirement to offer to repurchase
either series of Existing Notes. In the event we do not obtain such a waiver or do not refinance the Senior Secured
Credit Facilities, the Senior ABL Credit Agreement, the Existing Notes and/or such future Indebtedness, such
default or failure to repurchase any tendered Existing Notes could result in amounts outstanding under the Senior


-----

Secured Credit Facilities, the Senior ABL Credit Agreement, the Existing Notes or such future Indebtedness being
declared due and payable and/or cause a Securitization Facility or other financing arrangements to be wound down.

Our ability to pay cash to the Holders following the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event
may be limited by our then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when
necessary to make any required repurchases.

The Change of Control Triggering Event purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make
more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. We have no
present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control, although it is possible that we could
decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, we could, in the future, enter into certain
transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of
Control Triggering Event under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at
such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to incur additional
Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of
Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” and, in the case of Secured Indebtedness, “—
Certain Covenants—Liens.” Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Required
Holders. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any
covenants or provisions that may afford Holders of the Notes protection in the event of a highly leveraged
transaction.

The Issuers will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control
Triggering Event if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in
compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the
Issuers and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or
(ii) in connection with or in contemplation of any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Issuers (or any Affiliate
of the Issuers) have made an offer to purchase (an “Alternate Offer”) any and all Notes validly tendered at a cash
price equal to or higher than the Change of Control Payment and has purchased all Notes properly tendered in
accordance with the terms of the Alternate Offer.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer may be
made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event, conditional upon such Change of Control Triggering
Event, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of making of the Change of Control
Offer or Alternate Offer.

A Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer may be made at the same time as consents are solicited with
respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture, Notes, Guarantees and/or Security Documents (but
the Change of Control Offer and the Alternate Offer may not condition tenders on the delivery of such consents).

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law
interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable
law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular
transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred
and whether a Holder may require the Issuers to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above.

The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the
Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event, including the definition of “Change of Control,” may be
waived or modified with the written consent of the Required Holders.

**_Asset Sales_**

The Indenture will provide that the Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to,
consummate an Asset Sale, unless:


-----

(1) the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration (including, but
not limited to, by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any
liabilities, contingent or otherwise, in connection with, such Asset Sale) at the time of such Asset
Sale at least equal to the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Issuer at the time of
contractually agreeing to such Asset Sale) of the assets sold or otherwise disposed of; and

(2) except in the case of a Permitted Asset Swap, with respect to any Asset Sale in excess of the
greater of (x) $425.0 million and (y) 30.0% of LTM EBITDA, at least 75% of the consideration
for such Asset Sale, together with all other Asset Sales since the Acquisition Date (on a
cumulative basis), received by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in
the form of Cash Equivalents; provided that the amount of:

(a) the greater of the principal amount and the carrying value of any liabilities (as reflected
on the Issuer’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s most recent consolidated balance sheet or
in the footnotes thereto or, if incurred or increased subsequent to the date of such balance
sheet, such liabilities that would have been reflected on the Issuer’s or such Restricted
Subsidiary’s consolidated balance sheet or in the footnotes thereto if such incurrence or
increase had taken place on or prior to the date of such balance sheet, as determined by
the Issuer) of the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, other than liabilities that are by
their terms subordinated to the Notes (other than intercompany liabilities owing to a
Restricted Subsidiary being disposed of), that are (i) assumed by the transferee of any
such assets (or a third party in connection with such transfer) pursuant to a written
agreement which releases or indemnifies the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from
such liabilities or (ii) otherwise cancelled or terminated in connection with the
transaction;

(b) any securities, notes or other obligations or assets received by the Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted or reasonably expected by
the Issuer acting in good faith to be converted by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary
into Cash Equivalents (to the extent of the Cash Equivalents received or expected to be
received) or by their terms are required to be satisfied for Cash Equivalents within 180
days following the closing of such Asset Sale; and

(c) any Designated Non-cash Consideration received by the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary in such Asset Sale having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with
all other Designated Non-cash Consideration received pursuant to this clause (c) that is at
that time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of (i) $575.0 million and (ii) 50.0% of
LTM EBITDA (net of any non-cash consideration converted into Cash Equivalents) at
the time of the receipt of such Designated Non-cash Consideration (or, at the Issuer’s
option, at the time of contractually agreeing to such Asset Sale), with the fair market
value of each item of Designated Non-cash Consideration being measured at the time
received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value,

shall be deemed to be Cash Equivalents for purposes of this provision and for no other purpose.

Within 24 months after the later of (A) the date of any Asset Sale pursuant to the foregoing paragraph and
(B) the receipt of any Net Proceeds of such Asset Sale, the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, at its option, may
apply an amount not to exceed the Applicable Asset Sale Percentage of the Net Proceeds from such Asset Sale (the
“Applicable Proceeds”),

(1) to reduce or offer to reduce Indebtedness (through a redemption, prepayment, repayment or
purchase, as applicable) as follows:

(a) Obligations under the Notes;


-----

(b) (i) Equal Priority Obligations (other than the Notes); provided that if the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary shall so reduce any Equal Priority Obligations other than the Notes,
the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary will either (A) reduce Obligations under the
Notes on a pro rata basis with such other Equal Priority Obligations by, at its option,
(x) redeeming Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption” or (y) purchasing
Notes through open-market purchases or in privately negotiated transactions at market
prices (which may be below par), or (B) make an offer (in accordance with the
procedures set forth below for an Asset Sale Offer) to all Holders to purchase their Notes
on a ratable basis with such other Equal Priority Obligations for no less than 100% of the
principal amount thereof, plus the amount of accrued but unpaid interest, if any, thereon
up to the principal amount of Notes to be repurchased or (ii) Senior ABL Revolving
Credit Obligations;

(c) Obligations of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not the Co-Issuer or a Subsidiary Guarantor,
other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(d) to the extent such Applicable Proceeds are from an Asset Sale of property or assets of a
Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor, Obligations of an Issuer or a
Subsidiary Guarantor other than Subordinated Indebtedness and other than Indebtedness
owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; provided that to the extent the Issuer or
any Restricted Subsidiary makes an offer to redeem, prepay, repay or purchase any
Obligations pursuant to any of the foregoing clauses (a)-(d) at a price of no less than
100% of the principal amount thereof, to the extent the relevant creditors do not accept
such offering, the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries will be deemed to have applied
an amount of the Applicable Proceeds equal to such amount not so accepted in such offer,
and such amount shall not increase the amount of Excess Proceeds (and such amount
shall instead constitute Declined Proceeds); or

(2) to make (a) an Investment in any one or more businesses, provided that such Investment in any
business is in the form of the acquisition of Capital Stock and results in the Issuer or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be, owning an amount of the Capital Stock of such
business such that it constitutes or continues to constitute a Restricted Subsidiary, (b) capital
expenditures or (c) acquisitions of other properties or assets that, in each of (a), (b) and (c), are
used or useful in a Similar Business or replace the businesses, properties and/or assets that are the
subject of such Asset Sale; provided that the Issuers may elect to deem Investments, capital
expenditures or acquisitions within the scope of the foregoing clauses (a), (b) or (c), as applicable,
that occur prior to the receipt of the Applicable Proceeds to have been made in accordance with
this clause (2) so long as such deemed Investments, capital expenditures or acquisitions shall have
been made no earlier than the earliest of (x) the notice of such Asset Sale to the Trustee, (y) the
execution of a definitive agreement relating to such Asset Sale or (z) 180 days prior to the
consummation of such Asset Sale; or

(3) any combination of the foregoing; provided, that a binding commitment or letter of intent entered
into not later than the end of such 24-month period shall be treated as a permitted application of
the Applicable Proceeds from the date of such commitment or letter of intent so long as the Issuer,
or such Restricted Subsidiary enters into such commitment or letter of intent with the good faith
expectation that such Applicable Proceeds will be applied to satisfy such commitment or letter of
intent within six months of the end of such 24-month period (an “Acceptable Commitment”) or, in
the event any Acceptable Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before the
Applicable Proceeds are applied in connection therewith, the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary
enters into another Acceptable Commitment (a “Second Commitment”) within six months of such
cancellation or termination; provided further that if any Second Commitment is later cancelled or
terminated for any reason before such Applicable Proceeds are applied, then such Applicable
Proceeds shall constitute Excess Proceeds.


-----

Notwithstanding any other provisions of this covenant, (i) to the extent that the application of any or all of
the Applicable Proceeds of any Asset Sale or Casualty Event by a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Subsidiary
Guarantor (a “Non-Guarantor Disposition”) (A) is (x) prohibited or delayed by or would violate or conflict with
applicable local law, (y) restricted by applicable organizational documents or any agreement or (z) subject to other
organizational or administrative impediments from being repatriated to the United States (including for the
avoidance of doubt restrictions, prohibitions or impediments relating to financial assistance, corporate benefit, thin
capitalization, capital maintenance and similar legal principles, restrictions on upstreaming and/or cross-streaming
of Cash Equivalents intra-group and relating to the fiduciary and/or statutory duties of the directors (or equivalent
Persons) of the Issuer and/or any of its Subsidiaries) or would conflict with the fiduciary and/or statutory duties of
such Subsidiary’s directors (or equivalent Persons), or (B) would result in, or could reasonably be expected to result
in, a risk of personal or criminal liability for any officer, director, employee, manager, member of management or
consultant of such Subsidiary, an amount equal to the portion of such Applicable Proceeds so affected will not be
required to be applied in compliance with this covenant, and such amounts may be retained by the applicable
Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor; provided that if at any time within one year following the
date on which the respective payment would otherwise have been required, such repatriation of any of such affected
Applicable Proceeds is permitted under the applicable local law, the applicable organizational document or
agreement or the applicable other impediment, an amount equal to such amount of Applicable Proceeds so permitted
to be repatriated will be promptly applied (net of any taxes, costs or expenses that would be payable or reserved
against if such amounts were actually repatriated whether or not they are repatriated) in compliance with this
covenant or (ii) to the extent that the Issuer has determined in good faith that repatriation of any or all of the
Applicable Proceeds of any Non-Guarantor Disposition could have a material adverse tax or cost consequence with
respect to such Applicable Proceeds (which for the avoidance of doubt, includes, but is not limited to, any
prepayment whereby doing so the Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary or any of their respective Affiliates and/or their
equityholders would incur a tax liability, including as a result of a tax dividend, a deemed dividend pursuant to Code
Section 956 or a withholding tax), the Applicable Proceeds so affected may be retained by the applicable Restricted
Subsidiary that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor and an amount equal to such Applicable Proceeds will not be required
to be applied in compliance with this covenant. The non-application of any prepayment amounts as a consequence
of the foregoing provisions will not, for the avoidance of doubt, constitute a Default or an Event of Default. For the
avoidance of doubt, nothing in the Indenture shall be construed to require the Issuer or any Subsidiary to repatriate
cash.

Any Applicable Proceeds (other than any amounts excluded from this covenant as set forth in the
immediately preceding paragraph) that are not invested or applied as provided and within the time period set forth in
the second preceding paragraph in excess of the Excess Proceeds Threshold will be deemed to constitute “Excess
**_Proceeds”; provided that any amount of Applicable Proceeds offered to Holders of the Notes pursuant to clause_**
(1)(b) of the second preceding paragraph shall not be deemed to be Excess Proceeds without regard to whether such
offer is accepted by any Holders and any amount of Applicable Proceeds offered to Holders pursuant to clause
(1)(b) of the second preceding paragraph that are not accepted shall be deemed to be Declined Proceeds. When the
aggregate amount of such Applicable Proceeds exceeds the greater of (i) $425.0 million and (ii) 30.0% of LTM
EBITDA in any fiscal year (the “Excess Proceeds Threshold”), the Issuer shall make an offer (an “Asset Sale
**_Offer”) to all Holders of the Notes and, if required or permitted by the terms of any other Equal Priority Obligations_**
or Obligations secured by a Lien permitted under the Indenture on the Collateral disposed of, to the holders of such
other Equal Priority Obligations or other Obligations, to purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount (or
accreted value, as applicable) of the Notes and such other Equal Priority Obligations or other Obligations that is,
with respect to the Notes only, in an amount equal to $1,000, or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof, in
case of the Notes that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds at an offer price, in the case of the Notes, in
cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof (or accreted value thereof, if less), plus accrued
and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date fixed for the closing of such offer, in accordance with the
procedures set forth in the Indenture, and in the case of such other Equal Priority Obligations or other Obligations, at
the offer price required by the terms thereof, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the agreement(s)
governing such other Equal Priority Obligations or other Obligations. The Issuers will commence an Asset Sale
Offer with respect to such Excess Proceeds within 20 Business Days after the date that Excess Proceeds exceed the
Excess Proceeds Threshold by delivering to the Holders the notice required pursuant to the terms of the Indenture,
with a copy to the Trustee. The Issuers may satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to any Applicable
Proceeds by making an Asset Sale Offer with respect to such Applicable Proceeds prior to the time period that may


-----

be required by the Indenture with respect to all or a part of the available Applicable Proceeds (the “Advance
**_Portion”) in advance of being required to do so by the Indenture (an “Advance Offer”)._**

To the extent that the aggregate amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of Notes and such other Equal
Priority Obligations or Obligations secured by a Lien permitted under the Indenture on the Collateral disposed of, as
the case may be, tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the amount offered in the Asset Sale Offer (or
in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Issuers may use any remaining Excess Proceeds (or in
the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) (“Declined Proceeds”) for any purposes not otherwise
prohibited under the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of Notes or such
other Equal Priority Obligations or other Obligations, as the case may be, surrendered by such holders thereof
exceeds the amount offered in the Asset Sale Offer (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the
Issuers shall purchase the Notes (subject to applicable DTC procedures as to global notes) and such other Equal
Priority Obligations or other Obligations, as the case may be, on a pro rata basis based on the aggregate principal
amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of the Notes or such other Equal Priority Obligations or other Obligations,
as the case may be, tendered with adjustments as necessary so that no Notes or such other Equal Priority Obligations
or other Obligations, as the case may be, will be repurchased in part in an unauthorized denomination. Upon
completion of any such Asset Sale Offer (or Advance Offer), the amount of Excess Proceeds (or in the case of an
Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) that resulted in the requirement to make an Asset Sale Offer shall be reset to
zero (regardless of whether there are any remaining Excess Proceeds (or Advance Portion) upon such completion).
Additionally, the Issuers may, at their option, make an Asset Sale Offer using Applicable Proceeds at any time after
the consummation of such Asset Sale. Upon consummation or expiration of any Asset Sale Offer (or Advance
Offer), any remaining Applicable Proceeds shall not be deemed Excess Proceeds and the Issuers may use such
Applicable Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited under the Indenture.

An Asset Sale Offer or Advance Offer may be made at the same time as consents are solicited with respect
to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture, Notes, Guarantees and/or Security Documents (but the
Asset Sale Offer or Advance Offer may not condition tenders on the delivery of such consents).

Pending the final application of the amount of any Applicable Proceeds pursuant to this covenant, the
Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily reduce Indebtedness, or otherwise use such Applicable
Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture.

The Issuers will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other
securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with
the repurchase of the Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer or an Advance Offer. To the extent that the provisions of
any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the
applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the
Indenture by virtue thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuers may rely on any no-action letters issued by
the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer
satisfies certain conditions.

The provisions under the Indenture relative to the Issuers’ obligation to make an offer to repurchase the
Notes as a result of an Asset Sale may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Required Holders.

The Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Senior ABL Credit Agreement and future credit agreements or
other similar agreements to which the Issuers become a party may contain restrictions on the Issuers’ ability to
repurchase Notes. In the event an Asset Sale occurs at a time when the Issuers are prohibited from purchasing Notes,
the Issuers could seek the consent of its lenders to the repurchase of Notes or could attempt to refinance the
borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Issuers do not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, the
Issuers will remain prohibited from repurchasing Notes. In such a case, the Issuers’ failure to repurchase tendered
Notes would constitute a Default under the Indenture which would, in turn, likely constitute a default under such
other agreements.


-----

**Certain Covenants**

Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants contained in the Indenture that will apply to the Issuer
and its Restricted Subsidiaries.

If on any date following the Issue Date, (i) the Notes have an Investment Grade Rating from either of the
Rating Agencies and (ii) no Default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture (the occurrence of the events
described in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) being collectively referred to as a “Covenant Suspension Event” and
the date thereof being referred to as the “Suspension Date”), then, the covenants specifically listed under the
following captions in this “Description of Notes” section of this offering memorandum will no longer be applicable
to the Notes (collectively, the “Suspended Covenants”) until the occurrence of the Reversion Date (as defined
below):

(1) “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales”;

(2) “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

(3) “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred
Stock”;

(4) the entire fourth and sixth paragraphs of “—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially
All Assets”;

(5) “—Transactions with Affiliates”;

(6) “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries”; and

(7) “—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries.”

During any period that the foregoing covenants have been suspended, the Issuer may not designate any of
its Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries.

If and while the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants, the
Notes will be entitled to substantially less covenant protection. In the event that the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants under the Indenture for any period of time as a result of the
foregoing, and on any subsequent date (the “Reversion Date”) both of the Rating Agencies withdraw their
Investment Grade Rating or downgrade the rating assigned to the Notes below an Investment Grade Rating (or for
the avoidance of doubt, only one Rating Agency withdraws its Investment Grade Rating or downgrades the rating
assigned to the Notes below an Investment Grade Rating in the event that such Rating Agency was the only Rating
Agency to give an Investment Grade Rating to the Notes), then the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will
thereafter again be subject to the Suspended Covenants under the Indenture with respect to future events. The period
of time between the Suspension Date and the Reversion Date is referred to in this description as the “Suspension
**_Period.” The Guarantees of the Guarantors will be suspended during the Suspension Period. Additionally, upon the_**
occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event, the amount of Excess Proceeds from any Asset Sales shall be reset to
zero.

During the Suspension Period, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will be entitled to incur Liens to
the extent provided for under “—Liens” (including, without limitation, Permitted Liens) to the extent provided for in
such covenant and any Permitted Liens which may refer to one or more Suspended Covenants shall be interpreted as
though such applicable Suspended Covenant(s) continued to be applicable during the Suspension Period (but solely
for purposes of the “—Liens” covenant and the “Permitted Liens” definition and for no other covenant).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of any such reinstatement, no action taken or omitted to be
taken by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries prior to such reinstatement will give rise to a Default or
Event of Default under the Indenture with respect to the Notes, and no Default or Event of Default will be deemed to


-----

exist or have occurred as a result of any failure by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to comply with any of the
Suspended Covenants during the Suspension Period; provided, that (1) with respect to Restricted Payments made
after such reinstatement, the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments will be calculated as though the
covenant described under the caption “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” had been in effect prior to, but not
during, the Suspension Period (including with respect to a Limited Condition Transaction entered into during the
Suspension Period); (2) all Indebtedness incurred or committed, or Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock issued,
during the Suspension Period (or deemed incurred or issued in connection with a Limited Condition Transaction
entered into during the Suspension Period) will be classified to have been incurred or issued pursuant to clause (3) of
the second paragraph of “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and
Preferred Stock”; (3) any Affiliate Transaction entered into after such reinstatement pursuant to an agreement
entered into during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (6) of the second
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Transactions with Affiliates”; (4) any encumbrance or restriction on
the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor to take any action described in clauses (1) through (3)
of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting
Restricted Subsidiaries” that becomes effective during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted
pursuant to clause (a) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Dividend and Other Payment
Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries”; (5) no Subsidiary of the Issuer shall be required to comply with the
covenant described under “—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries” after such
reinstatement with respect to any guarantee or obligation entered into by such Subsidiary during any Suspension
Period; and (6) all Investments made during the Suspension Period (or deemed made in connection with a Limited
Condition Transaction entered into during the Suspension Period) will be classified to have been made under clause
(5) of the definition of “Permitted Investments.”

Notwithstanding that the Suspended Covenants may be reinstated after the Reversion Date, (1) no Default,
Event of Default or breach of any kind will be deemed to exist under the Indenture, the Notes or the Guarantees with
respect to the Suspended Covenants, and none of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries shall bear any liability for any
actions taken or events occurring during the Suspension Period, or any actions taken at any time pursuant to any
contractual obligation arising during any Suspension Period, in each case as a result of a failure to comply with the
Suspended Covenants during the Suspension Period (or, upon termination of the Suspension Period or after that time
based solely on any action taken or event that occurred during the Suspension Period), and (2) following a Reversion
Date, the Issuer and each Restricted Subsidiary will be permitted, without causing a Default or Event of Default, to
honor, comply with or otherwise perform any contractual commitments or obligations arising during any Suspension
Period and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby.

There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain an Investment Grade Rating. The
Trustee shall have no duty to (i) monitor the ratings of the Notes, (ii) ascertain whether a Covenant Suspension
Event or Reversion Date have occurred, or (iii) notify the Holders of any of the foregoing.

**_Limited Condition Transactions_**

When calculating the availability under any basket, test or ratio under the Indenture or compliance with any
provision of the Indenture in connection with any Limited Condition Transaction and any actions or transactions
related thereto (including acquisitions, Investments, the incurrence, issuance or assumption of Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock and the use of proceeds thereof, the incurrence or assumption of Liens,
repayments, Restricted Payments, the designation of any Restricted Subsidiaries or Unrestricted Subsidiaries, and
Asset Sales or any disposition, issuance or other transaction excluded from the definition of “Asset Sale”), in each
case, at the option of the Issuer, any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, Holdings, a direct or indirect parent entity of the
Issuer, or any successor entity of any of the foregoing (including a third party) (the “Testing Party,” and the election
to exercise such option, an “LCT Election”), the date of determination for availability under any such basket, test or
ratio or whether any such action or transaction is permitted (or any requirement or condition therefor is complied
with or satisfied (including as to the absence of any continuing Default or Event of Default)) under the Indenture
shall be deemed to be the date (the “LCT Test Date”) either (a) the definitive agreements or letter of intent (or, if
applicable, a binding offer, or launch of a “certain funds” tender offer) for such Limited Condition Transaction are
entered into (or, if applicable, the date of delivery of a notice, declaration or making of a Restricted Payment or
similar event), (b) solely in connection with an acquisition to which the United Kingdom City Code on Takeovers
and Mergers or similar law or practices in other jurisdictions apply, the date on which a “Rule 2.7 announcement” of


-----

a firm intention to make an offer or similar announcement or determination in another jurisdiction subject to similar
laws in respect of a target of a Limited Condition Transaction or (c) any date occurring after the occurrence of
events described in either clause (a) or clause (b) and prior to the closing of such Limited Condition Transaction,
and, in each case, if, after giving pro forma effect to the Limited Condition Transaction and any actions or
transactions related thereto (including acquisitions, Investments, the incurrence, issuance or assumption of
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock and the use of proceeds thereof, the incurrence or assumption of
Liens, repayments, Restricted Payments, the designation of any Restricted Subsidiaries or Unrestricted Subsidiaries,
and Asset Sales or any disposition, issuance or other transaction excluded from the definition of “Asset Sale”) and
any related pro forma adjustments, disregarding for the purposes of such pro forma calculation any borrowing under
a revolving credit, working capital or letter of credit facility), as if they had occurred at the beginning of the most
recently ended four full fiscal quarters ending prior to the LCT Test Date for which internal consolidated financial
statements of the Issuer are available, the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been permitted to
take such actions or consummate such transactions on the relevant LCT Test Date in compliance with such ratio, test
or basket (and any related requirements and conditions), such ratio, test or basket (and any related requirements and
conditions) shall be deemed to have been complied with (or satisfied) for all purposes (in the case of Indebtedness,
for example, whether such Indebtedness is committed, issued or incurred at the LCT Test Date or at any time
thereafter); provided, that (a) if financial statements for one or more subsequent fiscal quarters shall have become
available, the Testing Party may elect, in its sole discretion, to re-determine all such ratios, tests or baskets on the
basis of such financial statements, in which case, such date of redetermination shall thereafter be deemed to be the
applicable LCT Test Date for purposes of such ratios, tests or baskets, (b) except as contemplated in the foregoing
clause (a), compliance with such ratios, tests or baskets (and any related requirements and conditions) shall not be
determined or tested at any time after the applicable LCT Test Date for such Limited Condition Transaction and any
actions or transactions related thereto (including acquisitions, Investments, the incurrence, issuance or assumption of
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock and the use of proceeds thereof, the incurrence or assumption of
Liens, repayments, Restricted Payments, the designation of any Restricted Subsidiaries or Unrestricted Subsidiaries,
and Asset Sales or any disposition, issuance or other transactions excluded from the definition of “Asset Sale”) and
(c) Consolidated Interest Expense for purposes of the Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio will be calculated using
an assumed interest rate based on the indicative interest margin contained in any financing commitment
documentation with respect to such Indebtedness or, if no such indicative interest margin exists, as reasonably
determined by the Testing Party in good faith.

For the avoidance of doubt, if the Testing Party has made an LCT Election, (1) if any of the ratios, tests or
baskets for which compliance was determined or tested as of the LCT Test Date would at any time after the LCT
Test Date have been exceeded or otherwise failed to have been complied with, including as a result of fluctuations in
any such ratio, test or basket, including due to fluctuations in exchange rates or EBITDA or total assets of the Issuer
or the Person subject to such Limited Condition Transaction at or prior to the consummation of the relevant
transaction or action, such baskets, tests or ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded or failed to have been
complied with as a result of such fluctuations; provided that if such ratios, tests or baskets improve as a result of
such fluctuations, such improved ratios, tests and/or baskets may be utilized; (2) if any related requirements and
conditions (including as to the absence of any continuing Default or Event of Default) for which compliance or
satisfaction was determined or tested as of the LCT Test Date would at any time after the LCT Test Date not have
been complied with or satisfied (including due to the occurrence or continuation of a Default or an Event of
Default), such requirements and conditions will not be deemed to have been failed to be complied with or satisfied
(and such Default or Event of Default shall be deemed not to have occurred or be continuing); and (3) in calculating
the availability under any ratio, test or basket in connection with any action or transaction unrelated to such Limited
Condition Transaction (including without limitation a separate Limited Condition Transaction) following the
relevant LCT Test Date and prior to the earlier of the date on which such Limited Condition Transaction is
consummated or the date that the definitive agreement, the date of notice or offer or date for redemption, purchase or
repayment specified in a notice for such Limited Condition Transaction is terminated, expires or passes, as
applicable, without consummation of such Limited Condition Transaction, any such ratio, test or basket shall be
determined or tested giving pro forma effect to such Limited Condition Transaction and any actions or transactions
related thereto.

In connection with any action being taken in connection with a Limited Condition Transaction, for
purposes of determining compliance with any provision of the Indenture which requires that no Default, Event of
Default or specified Event of Default, as applicable, has occurred, is continuing or would result from any such


-----

action, as applicable, such condition shall, at the option of the Testing Party, be deemed satisfied, so long as no
Default, Event of Default or specified Event of Default, as applicable, exists on the date of the definitive agreement,
the date of notice or offer or date for redemption, purchase or repayment for such Limited Condition Transaction, as
applicable. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Testing Party has exercised an LCT Election, and any Default, Event
of Default or specified Event of Default occurs following the date the definitive agreements (or, if applicable, the
date of delivery of a notice, declaration or making of a Restricted Payment or similar event) for the applicable
Limited Condition Transaction were entered into and prior to the consummation of such Limited Condition
Transaction, any such Default, Event of Default or specified Event of Default shall be deemed to not have occurred
or be continuing for purposes of determining whether any action being taken in connection with such Limited
Condition Transaction is permitted under the Indenture.

**_Certain Compliance Calculations_**

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the event an item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock
or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) is incurred, assumed or issued, any Lien is incurred or assumed, any
Restricted Payment is made or other transaction is undertaken (including a Limited Condition Transaction) in
reliance on a ratio basket based on the Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Equal Priority Debt
Ratio, Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio or Consolidated Total Debt Ratio or other ratio-based test, such ratio(s)
shall be calculated with respect to such incurrence, issuance or other transaction without giving effect to amounts
being utilized under any other non-ratio-based basket substantially concurrently. Each item of Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock that is incurred, assumed or issued, each Lien incurred and each other
transaction undertaken will be deemed to have been incurred, assumed, issued or taken first, to the extent available,
pursuant to the relevant Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Equal Priority Debt Ratio, Consolidated
Secured Debt Ratio or Consolidated Total Debt Ratio test. For the avoidance of doubt, when testing the availability
under a ratio basket for purposes of making a Restricted Payment, Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) incurred,
assumed or issued the proceeds of which are being utilized to make a Restricted Payment utilizing a non-ratio basket
shall not be given effect.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the event an item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock
or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) is committed, incurred, assumed or issued, any Lien is committed,
incurred, assumed or issued, any Restricted Payment is made or any other transaction is undertaken (including a
Limited Condition Transaction) in reliance on a ratio basket based on the Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio,
Consolidated Equal Priority Debt Ratio, Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio or Consolidated Total Debt Ratio or other
ratio-based test, such ratio(s) shall be calculated without regard to the commitment or incurrence of any
Indebtedness under any revolving facility or letter of credit facility (1) immediately prior to or in connection
therewith or (2) used to finance working capital needs of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries (as reasonably
determined by the Issuer).

If a proposed action, matter, transaction or amount (or a portion thereof) meets the criteria of more than one
applicable basket, permission or threshold under the Indenture, the Issuers shall be entitled to divide or classify or
later divide or reclassify (based on circumstances existing on the date of such reclassification) such action, matter,
transaction or amount (or a portion thereof) between such baskets, permission or thresholds as it shall elect from
time to time.

The Indenture shall provide that any calculation, test or measure that is determined with reference to the
Issuer’s financial statements (including, without limitation, EBITDA, Consolidated Interest Expense, Consolidated
Net Income, Consolidated Equal Priority Debt Ratio, Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio, Consolidated Total Debt
Ratio, Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio, Fixed Charges, and clause (2)(a) of the first paragraph under “—
Limitation on Restricted Payments”) may be determined with reference to the financial statements of a direct or
indirect parent entity of the Issuer instead, so long as such calculation, test or measure would not differ by more than
an immaterial amount when using the financial statements of such direct or indirect parent entity of the Issuer as
compared to if such calculation, test or measure were made using the Issuer’s financial statements (as determined in
good faith by the Issuer).

Any ratios, tests or baskets required to be satisfied in order for a specific action to be permitted under the
Indenture shall be calculated by dividing the appropriate component by the other component, carrying the result to


-----

one place more than the number of places by which such ratio is expressed herein and rounding the result up or
down to the nearest number (with a rounding up if there is no nearest number).

If the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary takes an action which at the time of the taking of such action
would in the good faith determination of the Issuer be permitted under the applicable provisions of the Indenture
based on the financial statements available at such time, such action shall be deemed to have been made in
compliance with the Indenture notwithstanding any subsequent adjustments, modifications or restatements made in
good faith to such financial statements affecting Consolidated Net Income, EBITDA or other applicable financial
metric.

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly:

(I) declare or pay any dividend or make any payment or distribution on account of the Issuer’s, or any
of its Restricted Subsidiaries’, Equity Interests (in each case, solely to a holder of Equity Interests
in such Person’s capacity as a holder of such Equity Interests), including any dividend, payment or
distribution payable in connection with any merger, amalgamation or consolidation other than:

(a) dividends, payments and distributions by the Issuer payable solely in Equity Interests
(other than Disqualified Stock) of the Issuer or in options, warrants or other rights to

or other Investment (or their Controlled Investment Affiliates or Immediate Family Members),
which Capital Stock was issued as part of an earn-out or similar arrangement in the acquisition of
such business, and which redemption, acquisition, retirement or repurchase relates the failure of
such earn-out to fully vest. provided, that at the time of, and after giving effect to, (a) any
Restricted Payment under clause (11)(iii) above other than a Restricted Investment, no Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing or would occur as a consequence thereof or (b) any
Restricted Investment permitted under clause (11)(iii) above, no Event of Default under clauses
(1), (2) or (6) of the first paragraph of “—Events of Default and Remedies” shall have occurred
and be continuing or would occur as a consequence thereof.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that a proposed Restricted
Payment (or a portion thereof) meets the criteria of clauses (1) through (24) above and/or one or more of the clauses
contained in the definition of “Permitted Investments,” or is entitled to be made pursuant to the first paragraph of
this covenant, the Issuer will be entitled to divide or classify or later divide or reclassify (based on circumstances
existing on the date of such reclassification) such Restricted Payment (or a portion thereof) between such clauses
(1) through (24) and such first paragraph and/or one or more of the clauses contained in the definition of “Permitted
Investments,” in any manner that otherwise complies with this covenant.

As of the Issue Date, all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries will be Restricted Subsidiaries. The Issuer will not
permit any Unrestricted Subsidiary to become a Restricted Subsidiary except pursuant to the definition of
“Unrestricted Subsidiary.” For purposes of designating any Restricted Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, all
outstanding Investments by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries (except to the extent repaid) in the Subsidiary
so designated will be deemed to be Restricted Payments in an amount determined as set forth in the penultimate
sentence of the definition of “Investments.” Such designation will be permitted only if a Restricted Payment in such
amount would be permitted at such time, pursuant to this covenant or pursuant to the definition of “Permitted
Investments,” and if such Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary. Unrestricted
Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants set forth in the Indenture.

For the avoidance of doubt, this covenant shall not restrict the making of any “AHYDO catch-up payment”
with respect to, and required by the terms of, any Indebtedness of the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
permitted to be incurred under the terms of the Indenture.

Clause (2)(a)(ii) of the first paragraph of this covenant is based on the amount calculated pursuant to clause
(b) of the definition of “Cumulative Credit” in the Term Loan Facilities, which is defined as the greatest of (x) the
cumulative retained excess cash flow amount (defined as excess cash flow that is not required to prepay loans under
the Term Loan B Facility), (y) 50% of consolidated net income (defined in a manner consistent with Consolidated
Net Income in the Indenture) and (z) cumulative EBITDA minus 1.5x Consolidated Interest Expense (each as
defined in a manner consistent with the corresponding terms in the Indenture).

or such Restricted Subsidiary could have incurred such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock under the first paragraph of this covenant without reliance on this clause (29);

greater of (i) $300.0 million and (ii) 20.0% of LTM EBITDA (in each case, determined on the date
of such incurrence); it being understood that any Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred

purposes of this clause (30) but shall be deemed incurred for the purposes of the first paragraph of
this covenant from and after the first date on which the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary could
have incurred such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the first paragraph
of this covenant without reliance on this clause (30);

the greater (a) $150.0 million and (b) 10.0% of LTM EBITDA;

(32) [reserved];

(33) [reserved];

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant:


-----

(1) in the event that an item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion
thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of permitted Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock described in clauses (1) through (38) above or is entitled to
be incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, the Issuer, in its sole discretion, may
divide or classify, and may from time to time redivide and reclassify, such item of Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) and will only be required to include
the amount and type of such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock in one or more of
the above clauses or under the first paragraph of this covenant; provided that all term Indebtedness
outstanding under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities on the Acquisition Date will be treated as
incurred on the Acquisition Date under clause (1) of the second paragraph above;

(2) the Issuer will be entitled to divide and classify an item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock in more than one of the types of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred
Stock described in the first and second paragraphs above;

(3) guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock that
is otherwise included in the determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness, Disqualified
Stock or Preferred Stock shall not be included;

(4) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are
incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to any clause of
the second paragraph above or the first paragraph above and the letters of credit, bankers’
acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock, then such other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock shall not be
included;

(5) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, or
Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory
redemption or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase
premium) or the liquidation preference thereof; and

(6) for purposes of calculating the Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Equal
Priority Debt Ratio, the Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio or the Consolidated Total Debt Ratio, as
applicable, in connection with the incurrence of any Indebtedness pursuant to the first or second
paragraph above or the creation or incurrence of any Lien pursuant to the definition of “Permitted
Liens,” the Issuer may elect, at its option, to treat all or any portion of the committed amount of
any Indebtedness (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances
thereunder) which is to be incurred (or any commitment in respect thereof) or secured by such
Lien, as the case may be (any such committed amount elected until revoked as described below,
the “Reserved Indebtedness Amount”), as being incurred as of such election date, and, if such
Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Equal Priority Debt Ratio, Consolidated
Secured Debt Ratio or Consolidated Total Debt Ratio, as applicable, is satisfied with respect
thereto on such election date, any subsequent borrowing or reborrowing thereunder (and the
issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will be deemed to
be permitted under this covenant or the definition of “Permitted Liens,” as applicable, whether or
not the Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Equal Priority Debt Ratio,
Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio or the Consolidated Total Debt Ratio, as applicable, at the actual
time of any subsequent borrowing or reborrowing (or issuance or creation of letters of credit or
bankers’ acceptances thereunder) is met; provided that for purposes of subsequent calculations of
the Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Equal Priority Debt Ratio,
Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio or the Consolidated Total Debt Ratio, as applicable, the
Reserved Indebtedness Amount shall be deemed to be outstanding, whether or not such amount is
actually outstanding, for so long as such commitments are outstanding or until the Issuer revokes
an election of a Reserved Indebtedness Amount.


-----

Accrual of interest or dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original
issue discount and the payment of interest or dividends in the form of additional Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock, as the case may be, of the same class will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock for purposes of this covenant. If Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred
Stock originally incurred in reliance upon a percentage of LTM EBITDA under this covenant is being refinanced
and such refinancing would cause the maximum amount of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock
thereunder to be exceeded at such time, then such refinancing will nevertheless be permitted thereunder and such
additional Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock will be deemed to have been incurred under the
applicable provision so long as the principal amount or liquidation preference of such refinancing Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock does not exceed the principal amount or liquidation preference of
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock being refinanced plus amounts permitted by the next sentence.
Any Refinancing Indebtedness and any Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock permitted to be incurred
under the Indenture to refinance Indebtedness incurred pursuant to clauses (1)-(38) above shall be deemed to include
additional Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock incurred to pay accrued but unpaid interest or
dividends, premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance costs, underwriting or initial purchaser discounts,
fees, costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) in connection with such
refinancing.

For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the incurrence of
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, the U.S. Dollar Equivalent principal amount or liquidation
preference of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock denominated in a foreign currency shall be
calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock
or Preferred Stock was, at the option of the Issuer, first committed or first incurred or upon execution of the
definitive documentation in respect thereof; provided that if such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred
Stock is incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock denominated in a foreign
currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable U.S. dollar-denominated restriction to be exceeded if
calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such U.S. dollardenominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount or liquidation
preference of such refinancing Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock does not exceed (a) the principal
amount or liquidation preference of such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock being refinanced plus
(b) the aggregate amount of accrued but unpaid interest, fees, underwriting or initial purchaser discounts, premiums
(including tender premiums) and other costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar
fees) incurred in connection with such refinancing.

The principal amount or liquidation preference of any Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock
incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, if incurred in a different currency
from the Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the
currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such respective Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.

The Indenture will not treat (1) unsecured Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to Secured Indebtedness
merely because it is unsecured or (2) Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to any other Indebtedness merely
because it has a junior priority with respect to the same collateral or because it is secured by different collateral or
issued or guaranteed by other obligors.

**_Liens_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Subsidiary Guarantor to, directly or indirectly, create, incur,
assume or suffer to exist any Lien (except Permitted Liens) (each, a “Subject Lien”) that secures Obligations under
any Indebtedness or any guarantee of Indebtedness, on any Collateral, unless (i) such Subject Lien expressly has
Junior Lien Priority on the Collateral relative to the Notes and the Guarantees or (ii) such Subject Lien is a Permitted
Lien.

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the time
of the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount of such
Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount of such


-----

Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the amortization of original
issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms, accretion of
original issue discount or liquidation preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a
result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies or increases in the value of property securing Indebtedness.

-----

the Issuer in the United States, any state thereof, the District of Columbia or any territory thereof
so long as the amount of Indebtedness of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries is not increased
thereby.

_Co-Issuer. The Co-Issuer may not consolidate or merge with or into or windup into, consummate a_

not materially less favorable, when taken as a whole, to the Issuer or its relevant Restricted
Subsidiary than those that would have been obtained in a comparable transaction by the Issuer or
such Restricted Subsidiary with an unrelated Person on an arm’s-length basis;

(6) any agreement or arrangement as in effect as of the Issue Date, or any amendment or replacement

transactions entered into by an Unrestricted Subsidiary with an Affiliate prior to the redesignation
of any such Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary (and not entered into in

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, (1) the priority of any Preferred Stock in

subordination of (including the application of any standstill requirements to) loans and advances made to the Issuer
or a Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness incurred by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary shall not be
deemed a restriction on the ability to make loans or advances.

**_Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Issuer will not permit any of its Wholly Owned Subsidiaries that are Restricted Subsidiaries (and nonWholly Owned Subsidiaries if such non-Wholly Owned Subsidiaries guarantee other capital markets debt securities
of the Issuers or any Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to clause (ii) below), other than the Co-Issuer, a Subsidiary
Guarantor, a Captive Insurance Subsidiary, a Foreign Subsidiary, a direct or indirect Subsidiary that is a direct or
indirect Domestic Subsidiary or a direct or indirect Foreign Subsidiary that is a CFC, a FSHCO Subsidiary or a
Securitization Subsidiary, to guarantee the payment of (i) the Term Loan Facilities incurred under clause (1) of the

(1) such Restricted Subsidiary within 60 days after the guarantee of such Indebtedness executes and
delivers a supplemental indenture to the Indenture providing for a Guarantee by such Restricted
Subsidiary, except that with respect to a guarantee of Indebtedness of the Issuers or any Subsidiary
Guarantor, if such Indebtedness is by its express terms subordinated in right of payment to the
Notes or such Subsidiary Guarantor’s Guarantee, any such guarantee by such Restricted
Subsidiary with respect to such Indebtedness shall be subordinated in right of payment to such
Guarantee substantially to the same extent as such Indebtedness is subordinated to the Notes; and

(2) such Restricted Subsidiary waives and will not in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit
or advantage of, any rights of reimbursement, indemnity or subrogation or any other applicable
rights against the Issuer or any other Restricted Subsidiary as a result of any payment by such
Restricted Subsidiary under its Guarantee;

_provided that this covenant shall not be applicable to any guarantee of any Restricted Subsidiary that_
existed at the time such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary and was not incurred in connection with, or in
contemplation of, such Person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary. The Issuer may elect, in its sole discretion, to
cause any Subsidiary that is not otherwise required to be a Subsidiary Guarantor to become a Subsidiary Guarantor,
in which case such Subsidiary shall not be required to comply with the 60 day period described in clause (1) above.

**_Reports and Other Information_**

So long as any Notes are outstanding, the Issuer will have its annual consolidated financial statements
audited by a nationally recognized firm of independent auditors. In addition, after the Issue Date, so long as any
Notes are outstanding, the Issuer will furnish to the Holders of the Notes the following reports:

“significant” at the 20% or greater level pursuant to clauses (1)(i) and (ii) of the definition of
“Significant Subsidiary” under Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X only), 4.01, 4.02(a) and (b), 5.01 and

principal financial officer and principal operating officer only and other than with respect to
information otherwise required or contemplated by subclause (3) of such Item or by Item 402 of
Regulation S-K) as in effect on the Issue Date if the Issuer were required to file such reports;

_provided, however, that (A) no such report will be required to include as an exhibit, or to include a_
summary of the terms of, any employment or compensatory arrangement, agreement, plan or understanding between
the Issuer (or any of its direct or indirect parent entities or its Subsidiaries) and any director, manager or officer, of
the Issuer (or any of its direct or indirect parent entities or its Subsidiaries), (B) the Issuer shall not be required to
make available any information regarding the occurrence of any of the events set forth in clause (2) above if the
Issuer determines in its good faith judgment that the event that would otherwise be required to be disclosed is not
material to the Holders of the Notes or the business, assets, operations, financial positions or prospects of the Issuer
and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole, (C) no such report will be required to comply with Regulation G
under the Exchange Act or Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K with respect to any “non-GAAP” financial information
contained therein, (D) no such report will be required to comply with Regulation S-X including, without limitation,

such report will be required to provide any information that is not otherwise similar to information currently
included in the offering memorandum related to the Existing Notes, (F) in no event will such reports be required to
include as an exhibit copies of any agreements, financial statements or other items that would be required to be filed
as exhibits under the SEC rules, (G) trade secrets and other information that could cause competitive harm to the
Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may be excluded from any disclosures, (H) such financial statements or
information will not be required to contain any “segment reporting”, (I) such financial statements and information
may, at the election of the Issuer, be prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP or IFRS and (J) no report will be
required to be provided in connection with the Seller Notes Repurchase.

All such annual reports shall be furnished within 135 days after the end of the fiscal year to which they
relate; provided that the annual report for any fiscal year in which either (A) the Issuer or any Subsidiary has
consummated a material (in the good faith judgment of management of the Issuer) acquisition or similar Investment
or (B) a material (in the good faith judgment of management of the Issuer) accounting change has occurred, shall be
furnished within 150 days after the end of such fiscal year; provided that to the extent the Issuer has a longer period
to deliver annual reports in accordance with Section 6.01(a) of the Term Loan Facilities, the Issuers shall be
permitted to deliver such information within such longer period; all such quarterly reports shall be furnished within
60 days after the end of the fiscal quarter to which they relate; provided that the quarterly report for the fiscal quarter
ending on or about June 30, 2024 or any fiscal quarter in which either (A) the Issuer or any Subsidiary has
consummated a material (in the good faith judgment of management of the Issuer) acquisition or similar Investment
or (B) a material (in the good faith judgment of management of the Issuer) accounting change has occurred, shall be
furnished within 90 days after the end of the fiscal quarter which they relate; provided that to the extent the Issuer
has a longer period to deliver annual reports in accordance with Section 6.01(b) of the Term Loan Facilities, the
Issuers shall be permitted to deliver such information within such longer period; and all such current reports shall be
furnished within 15 days of the due date specified in the SEC’s rules and regulations for reporting companies under
the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any annual reports or quarterly reports may be furnished on or
prior to the due date applicable to the Issuer or any parent entity of the Issuer pursuant to the SEC’s rules and
regulations under the Exchange Act, if later than a date provided in the preceding sentence.

The Issuer will be deemed to have furnished the reports referred to in clauses (1) and (2) of the first
paragraph of this covenant if the Issuer or any parent entity of the Issuer has filed reports containing substantially
such information (or any such information of a parent entity pursuant to the fourth succeeding paragraph) with the
SEC.

If the Issuer or any parent entity of the Issuer does not file reports containing such information with the
SEC, then the Issuer will make available such information and such reports to any Holder of the Notes and to any
beneficial owner of the Notes, in each case by posting such information on a password-protected website or online
data system which will require a confidentiality acknowledgment, and will make such information readily available
to any bona fide prospective investor, any securities analyst (to the extent providing analysis of investment in the
Notes) or any market maker in the Notes who agrees to treat such information as confidential; provided that the


-----

Issuer shall post such information thereon and make readily available any password or other login information to
any such bona fide prospective investor, securities analyst or market maker; provided, however, that the Issuer may
deny access to any information or reports otherwise to be provided pursuant to this covenant to any such Holder,
beneficial owner, bona fide prospective investor, securities analyst or market maker that is a competitor or to the
extent that the Issuer determines in its sole discretion that the provision of such information to such Person may be
harmful to the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, its parent entities or the Investors; provided, further, that such Holders,
beneficial owners, bona fide prospective investors, securities analysts and market makers shall agree to (A) treat all
such reports (and information contained therein) as confidential, (B) not to use such reports (and the information
contained therein) for any purpose other than their investment or potential investment in the Notes and (C) not
publicly disclose any such reports (and the information contained therein).

To the extent not satisfied by the foregoing, the Issuer will furnish to Holders of the Notes, securities
analysts and prospective investors upon request the information required to be delivered pursuant to
Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), so long as the Notes are not
freely transferable under the Securities Act.

If any Subsidiary of the Issuer is an Unrestricted Subsidiary and if any such Unrestricted Subsidiary or
group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, if taken together as one Subsidiary, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary of
the Issuer, then the Issuer should furnish the annual and quarterly information required by clause (1) of the first
paragraph of this covenant, which shall include a presentation of selected financial metrics (in the Issuer’s sole
discretion) of such Unrestricted Subsidiaries as a group in the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations.”

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indenture will permit the Issuer to satisfy its obligations in this
covenant with respect to financial information relating to the Issuer by furnishing financial information relating to
Holdings or any parent entity of the Issuer; provided that if Holdings or such parent entity does not Guarantee the
Notes then the same is accompanied by selected financial metrics that show the differences (in the Issuer’s sole
discretion) between the information relating to Holdings or such parent, on the one hand, and the information
relating to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries on a stand-alone basis, on the other hand.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Issuer will not be deemed to have failed to comply
with any of its obligations hereunder for purposes of clause (3) under “—Events of Default and Remedies” until
180 days after the receipt of the written notice delivered thereunder.

To the extent any information is not provided within the time periods specified in this section “—Reports
and Other Information” and such information is subsequently provided, the Issuer will be deemed to have satisfied
its obligations with respect thereto at such time and any Default with respect thereto shall be deemed to have been
cured.

The Trustee shall have no duty to review or analyze any reports furnished or made available to it and the
Trustee’s receipt of such reports shall not constitute actual or constructive knowledge of the information contained
therein or determinable therefrom, including the Issuers’ compliance with any of its covenants (as to which the
Trustee is entitled to conclusively rely on an Officer’s Certificate).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer will not be required to disclose any information or take any
actions that, in the good faith view of the Issuer, would violate applicable securities laws or the SEC’s “gunjumping” rules.

**Events of Default and Remedies**

The Indenture will provide that each of the following is an “Event of Default”:

(1) default in payment when due and payable, upon redemption, acceleration or otherwise, of
principal of, or premium, if any, on the Notes;


-----

(2) default for 30 days or more in the payment when due of interest on or with respect to the Notes;

(3) failure by the Issuers or any Guarantor for 60 days after receipt of written notice given by the
Trustee or the Holders of not less than 30% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding
Notes to comply with any of their obligations, covenants or agreements (other than a default
referred to in clause (1) or (2) above) contained in the Indenture or the Notes;

(4) (i) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there is issued or by which
there is secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuer or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries or the payment of which is guaranteed by the Issuer or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries, other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, whether such
Indebtedness or guarantee now exists or is created after the issuance of the Notes, if both:

(a) such default either results from the failure to pay any principal of such Indebtedness at its
stated final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) or relates to an
obligation other than the obligation to pay principal of any such Indebtedness at its stated
final maturity and results in the holder or holders of such Indebtedness causing such
Indebtedness to become due prior to its stated maturity; and

(b) the principal amount of such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any
other such Indebtedness in default for failure to pay principal at stated final maturity
(after giving effect to any applicable grace periods), or the maturity of which has been so
accelerated, aggregate the greater of (i) $700.0 million (or its foreign currency
equivalent) and (ii) 50.0% of LTM EBITDA or more outstanding;

(5) (i) failure by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary (or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that
together (as of the latest consolidated financial statements of the Issuer for a fiscal quarter end
provided as required under “—Reports and Other Information”) would constitute a Significant
Subsidiary) to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of the greater of (i) $700.0 million and
(ii) 50.0% of LTM EBITDA (net of amounts covered by insurance policies issued by reputable
insurance companies), which final judgments remain unpaid, undischarged and unstayed for a
period of more than 60 days after such judgment becomes final, and in the event such judgment is
covered by insurance, an enforcement proceeding has been commenced by any creditor upon such
judgment or decree which is not promptly stayed;

(6) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary
(or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that together (as of the latest consolidated financial
statements of the Issuer for a fiscal quarter end provided as required under “—Reports and Other
Information”) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary);

(7) the Guarantee of any Subsidiary Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary (or any group of
Subsidiary Guarantors that together (as of the latest consolidated financial statements of the Issuer
for a fiscal quarter end provided as required under “—Reports and Other Information”) would
constitute a Significant Subsidiary) shall for any reason cease to be in full force and effect or be
declared null and void or any responsible officer of the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor that is a
Significant Subsidiary (or the responsible officers of any group of Subsidiary Guarantors that
together (as of the latest consolidated financial statements of the Issuer for a fiscal quarter end
provided as required under “—Reports and Other Information”) would constitute a Significant
Subsidiary), as the case may be, denies in writing that it has any further liability under its
Guarantee or gives written notice to such effect, other than by reason of the termination of the
Indenture or the release of any such Guarantee in accordance with the Indenture;

(8) (i) the Liens created by the Security Documents shall at any time not constitute a valid and
perfected Lien on any material portion of the Collateral intended to be covered thereby (unless
perfection is not required by the Indenture or the Security Documents) other than (A) in
accordance with the terms of the relevant Security Document and the Indenture, (B) the


-----

satisfaction in full of all Obligations under the Indenture or (C) any loss of perfection that results
from the failure of the Controlling Collateral Agent, the Notes Collateral Agent, the Senior ABL
Credit Agreement Collateral Agent or other applicable collateral agent to maintain possession of
certificates delivered to it representing securities pledged under the Security Documents and
(ii) such default continues for 30 days after receipt of written notice given by the Trustee or the
Holders of not less than 30% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes;

(9) the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary (or any group of Subsidiary
Guarantors that together (as of the latest consolidated financial statements of Holdings for a fiscal
quarter end provided as required under “—Reports and Other Information”) would constitute a
Significant Subsidiary) shall assert, in any pleading in any court of competent jurisdiction, that
any security interest in any Security Document is invalid or unenforceable (other than by reason of
the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Indenture and discharge of the Indenture, the
release of the Guarantor of such Subsidiary Guarantor in accordance with the terms of the
Indenture or the release of such security interest in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and
the Security Documents); and

(10) the failure by the Issuers to consummate the Special Mandatory Redemption to the extent
required, as described under “—Escrow of Gross Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”

If any Event of Default (other than of a type specified in clause (6) above) occurs and is continuing under
the Indenture, the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 30% in aggregate principal amount of all the then
outstanding Notes may declare the principal, premium, if any, interest and any other monetary obligations on all the
then outstanding Notes to be due and payable immediately; provided that no such declaration may be made with
respect to any action taken, and reported publicly or to Holders, more than two years prior to such declaration. Any
notice of Default under clauses (3), (4), (5), (7), (8) or (9) of the first paragraph of this section, notice of acceleration
with respect to an Event of Default under clauses (3), (4), (5), (7), (8) or (9) of the first paragraph of this section,
instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of Default under clauses (3), (4), (5), (7), (8) or (9) of the first
paragraph of this section, notice of acceleration with respect to an Event of Default under clauses (3), (4), (5), (7),
(8) or (9) of the first paragraph of this section or instruction to the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent to take any
other action with respect to an alleged Default or Event of Default under clauses (3), (4), (5), (7), (8) or (9) of the
first paragraph of this section (a “Noteholder Direction”) provided by any one or more Holders (other than a
Regulated Bank) (each, a “Directing Holder”) must be accompanied by a written representation from each such
Holder delivered to the Issuer, the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, if applicable, that (i) such Holder is not
(or, in the case such Holder is DTC or DTC’s nominee, that such Holder is being instructed solely by beneficial
owners that are not) Net Short and (ii) such Holder and the Affiliates of such Holder do not (or, in the case such
Holder is DTC or DTC’s nominee, that such Holder is being instructed solely by beneficial owners and Affiliates of
such beneficial owners that do not) hold or beneficially own Notes in excess of the Voting Cap (each, a “Position
**_Representation”), which representation, in the case of a Noteholder Direction relating to delivery of a notice of_**
Default shall be deemed a continuing representation until the resulting Event of Default is cured or otherwise ceases
to exist or the Notes are accelerated. In addition, each Directing Holder is deemed, at the time of providing a
Noteholder Direction, to covenant to provide the Issuer with such other information as the Issuer may reasonably
request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such Directing Holder’s Position Representation within
five Business Days of request therefor (a “Verification Covenant”). In any case in which the Holder is DTC or
DTC’s nominee, any Position Representation or Verification Covenant required hereunder shall be provided by the
beneficial owner of the Notes in lieu of DTC or DTC’s nominee and DTC shall be entitled to conclusively rely on
such Position Representation and Verification Covenant in delivering its direction to the Trustee or the Notes
Collateral Agent, as applicable.

If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Issuer
determines in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was, at any relevant time, in
breach of its Position Representation and the Issuer provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate certifying that
the Issuer has (i) a good faith reasonable basis to believe that one or more Directing Holders were at any relevant
time in breach of their Position Representation or their Verification Covenant and (ii) initiated proceedings in a court
of competent jurisdiction seeking a determination that such Directing Holders were, at such time, in breach of their
Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder

Direction, the cure period with respect to such Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect
to such Event of Default shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending a final and
nonappealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction on such matter. If such Officer’s Certificate has
been delivered to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, if applicable, the Trustee and the Notes Collateral
Agent, as applicable, shall refrain from acting in accordance with such Noteholder Direction until such time as the
Issuer provides to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, if applicable, an Officer’s Certificate stating that
(i) such Directing Holders have satisfied their Verification Covenant or (ii) such Directing Holders have failed to
satisfy its Verification Covenant, and during such time the cure period with respect to any Default shall be
automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable
Noteholder Direction shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending satisfaction of such
Verification Covenant. Any breach of the Position Representation shall result in such Directing Holder’s
participation in such Noteholder Direction being disregarded; and, if, without the participation of such Directing
Holder, the percentage of Notes held by the remaining Holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have
been insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio
(other than any indemnity such Holder may have offered or provided to the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent),
with the effect that such Event of Default shall be deemed never to have occurred, and any related acceleration
rescinded, and the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, if applicable, shall be deemed not to have received such
Noteholder Direction or any notice of such alleged Default or Event of Default, shall not be permitted to act thereon
and shall be restricted from accepting and acting on any future Noteholder Direction in relation to such Event of
Default. If the Directing Holder has satisfied its Verification Covenant, then the Trustee and the Notes Collateral
Agent, if applicable, shall be permitted to act in accordance with such Noteholder Direction. Notwithstanding the
above, if such Directing Holder’s participation is not required to achieve the requisite level of consent of Holders
required under the Indenture to give such Noteholder Direction, the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, if
applicable, shall be permitted to act in accordance with such Noteholder Direction notwithstanding any action taken
or to be taken by the Issuer (as described above). Each of the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent shall be
entitled to conclusively rely on any Noteholder Direction or Officer’s Certificate delivered to it in accordance with
the Indenture without verification, investigation or otherwise as to the statements made therein.

Notwithstanding anything in the preceding two paragraphs to the contrary, any Noteholder Direction
delivered to the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent during the pendency of an Event of Default as the result of a
bankruptcy or similar proceeding shall not require compliance with the foregoing paragraphs. In addition, for the
avoidance of doubt, the foregoing paragraphs shall not apply to any Holder that is a Regulated Bank. Each Holder
by accepting a Note acknowledges and agrees that neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent (nor any agent)
shall not be liable to any person for acting or refraining to act in accordance with (i) the foregoing provisions,
(ii) any Noteholder Direction, (iii) any Officer’s Certificate or (iv) its duties under the Indenture, as the Trustee or
the Notes Collateral Agent, if applicable, may determine in its sole discretion. Neither the Trustee nor the Notes
Collateral Agent shall have any obligation (i) to monitor, investigate, verify or otherwise determine if a Holder has a
Net Short position, (ii) investigate the accuracy or authenticity of any Position Representation, (iii) inquire if the
Issuer will seek action to determine if a Directing Holder has breached its Position Representation, (iv) enforce any
Verification Covenant, (v) monitor any court proceedings undertaken in connection therewith, (vi) monitor or
investigate whether any Default or Event of Default has been publicly reported or (vii) otherwise make any
calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to any Derivative Instruments, Net Short position, Long
Derivative Instrument, Short Derivative Instrument or otherwise.

Upon the effectiveness of such declaration, or in the case of clauses (3), (4), (5), (7), (8) or (9) of the first
paragraph of this section, upon a valid Noteholder Direction, to accelerate the Notes, such principal of and premium,
if any, and interest will be due and payable immediately. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an Event of
Default arising under clause (6) of the first paragraph of this section, all outstanding Notes will become due and
payable without further action or notice. The Indenture will provide that the Trustee may withhold from the Holders
notice of any continuing Default, except a Default relating to the payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest,
if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest.

The Indenture will provide, subject to the foregoing, that the Required Holders, by notice to the Trustee
may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes waive any existing Default and its consequences under the
Indenture or the Security Documents and rescind any acceleration with respect to the Notes and its consequences
(except if such rescission would conflict with any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction and except a


-----

continuing Default in the payment of interest on, premium, if any, or the principal of, any Note held by a nonconsenting Holder).

In the event of any Event of Default specified in clauses (3), (4), (5), (7), (8) or (9) of the first paragraph of
this section, such Event of Default and all consequences thereof (excluding any resulting payment default, other than
as a result of acceleration of the Notes) shall be annulled, waived and rescinded, automatically and without any
action by the Trustee or the Holders, if after such Event of Default arose:

(1) the Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been discharged;

(2) the requisite number of holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action
(as the case may be) giving rise to such Event of Default; or

(3) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured.

In case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent
will be under any obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of
any of the Holders of the Notes unless the Holders have offered and, if requested, provided to the Trustee and the
Notes Collateral Agent, if applicable, indemnity or security satisfactory to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral
Agent, if applicable, against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of
principal, premium (if any) or interest when due on or after the respective due dates expressed in an outstanding
Note, no Holder of a Note may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing
and, if such Event of Default is in respect of clause (3), (4), (5), (7), (8) or (9) of the first
paragraph of this section, such Holder is not in breach of a Position Representation or Verification
Covenant;

(2) the Holders, or in the case of clauses (3), (4), (5), (7) (8) or (9) of the first paragraph of this
section, Directing Holders that are not in breach of a Position Representation or Verification
Covenant, comprising at least 30% in the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding
Notes have requested in writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) Holders of the Notes have offered, and if requested, provided to the Trustee security or indemnity
satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt thereof and the
offer of security or indemnity; and

(5) the Required Holders have not given the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such written request
within such 60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions contained in the Indenture, including those described above, the Required
Holders are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy
available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Trustee, however, may
refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly
prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder of a Note or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability, and
may take any other action that is not inconsistent with any such direction received from Holders of the Notes (it
being understood that the Trustee does not have an affirmative duty to determine whether any action is prejudicial to
any Holder).

The Indenture will provide that the Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement
regarding compliance with the Indenture, and the Issuer is required, within 20 Business Days upon becoming aware
of any Default, to deliver to the Trustee a statement specifying such Default (unless such Default has been cured or
waived within such 20-Business Day time period). The Trustee will not be deemed to have knowledge of any


-----

Defaults or Events of Default unless written notice of an event, which is in fact a Default, has been delivered to the
Trustee at its office specified in the Indenture and such notice references the Notes and the Indenture and states that
it is a “Notice of Default.”

Any Default or Event of Default resulting from the failure to deliver a notice, report or certificate under the
Indenture shall cease to exist and be cured in all respects if the underlying Default or Event of Default giving rise to
such notice, report or certificate requirement shall have ceased to exist and/or be cured (including pursuant to this
paragraph). For the avoidance of doubt, each of the parties hereto agree that any court of competent jurisdiction may
(x) extend or stay any grace period set forth in the Indenture prior to when any actual or alleged Default becomes an
actual or alleged Event of Default or (y) stay the exercise of remedies by the Trustee or Holders contemplated by the
Indenture or otherwise upon the occurrence of an actual or alleged Event of Default, in each case of clauses (x) and
(y), in accordance with the requirements of applicable law.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Managers, Officers, Members, Partners, Employees and Equityholders**

No past, present or future director, manager, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner or direct or
indirect equityholder of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiaries or of any of their direct or indirect parent
companies (other than in such equityholder’s capacity as an Issuer or a Guarantor) shall have any liability, for any
obligations of the Issuers or the Guarantors under the Notes, the Guarantees, the Indenture or the Security
Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of such obligations or their creation. Each Holder
by accepting Notes waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for
issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the federal securities laws and it is
the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance**

The obligations of the Issuers and the Guarantors under the Indenture, the Notes, the Guarantees and the
Security Documents, as the case may be, will terminate (other than certain obligations) and will be released upon
payment in full of all of the Notes. The Issuers may, at their option and at any time, elect to have all of their
obligations discharged with respect to the Notes and have each Guarantor’s obligation discharged with respect to its
Guarantee (“Legal Defeasance”) and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of Default except for:

(1) the rights of Holders to receive payments in respect of the principal of, premium, if any, and
interest on the Notes when such payments are due solely out of the trust created pursuant to the
Indenture;

(2) the Issuers’ obligations with respect to Notes concerning issuing temporary Notes, registration of
such Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency
for payment and money for security payments held in trust;

(3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee, and the Issuers’ obligations in
connection therewith; and

(4) the Legal Defeasance provisions of the Indenture.

In addition, the Issuers may, at their option and at any time, elect to have its obligations and those of each
Guarantor released with respect to substantially all of the restrictive covenants that are described in the Indenture
with respect to the Notes (“Covenant Defeasance”) and thereafter any omission to comply with such obligations
shall not constitute a Default or Event of Default with respect to the Notes. In the event Covenant Defeasance
occurs, certain events (not including bankruptcy, receivership, rehabilitation and insolvency events pertaining to the
Issuers) described under “—Events of Default and Remedies” will no longer constitute a Default or an Event of
Default with respect to the Notes.

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance with respect to the Notes:


-----

(1) the Issuers shall irrevocably deposit with the Trustee (or such other entity designated by the
Issuers for this purpose), in trust, for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes, cash in U.S. dollars,
U.S. Government Securities, or a combination thereof, in such amount as will be sufficient, in the
opinion of an Independent Financial Advisor, without consideration of any reinvestment to pay the
principal of, premium, if any, and interest due on such Notes on the stated maturity date or on the
redemption date, as the case may be, of such principal, premium, if any, or interest on such Notes
and the Issuers must specify whether such Notes are being defeased to maturity or to a particular
redemption date; provided, that upon any redemption that requires the payment of the Applicable
Premium, the amount deposited shall be sufficient for purposes of the Indenture to the extent that
an amount is deposited with the Trustee (or such other entity designated by the Issuers for this
purpose) equal to the Applicable Premium with respect to such series calculated as of the date of
the notice of redemption, with any deficit as of the date of redemption (any such amount, the
“Applicable Premium Deficit”) only required to be deposited with the Trustee (or such other
entity designated by the Issuers for this purpose) on or prior to the date of redemption. Any
Applicable Premium Deficit shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee at
least one Business Day prior to the date of the deposit of such Applicable Premium Deficit that
confirms that such Applicable Premium Deficit shall be applied toward such redemption;

(2) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Issuers shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of
Counsel confirming that, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions,

(a) the Issuers have received from, or there has been published by, the United States Internal
Revenue Service a ruling, or

(b) since the Issue Date, there has been a change in the applicable U.S. federal income tax
law,

in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such Opinion of Counsel shall confirm that, subject to
customary assumptions and exclusions, the beneficial owners of the Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss
for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income
tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Legal
Defeasance had not occurred;

(3) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Issuers shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of
Counsel confirming that, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, the beneficial owners
of the Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a
result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same
amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Covenant
Defeasance had not occurred;

(4) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in a breach or violation of, or
constitute a default under, any material agreement or instrument (other than the Indenture) to
which the Issuers or any Guarantor is a party or by which the Issuers or any Guarantor is bound
(other than that resulting from any borrowing of funds to be applied to make the deposit required
to effect such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance and any similar and simultaneous deposit
relating to other Indebtedness, and, in each case, the granting of Liens in connection therewith);

(5) the Issuers shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was
not made by the Issuers with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding any
creditors of the Issuers or any Guarantor or others; and

(6) the Issuers shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel
(which Opinion of Counsel may be subject to customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating
that all conditions precedent provided for or relating to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant
Defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with.


-----

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to all Notes (other than certain
rights of the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent and the Issuers’ obligations with respect thereto), when either:

(1) all Notes theretofore authenticated and delivered, except lost, stolen or destroyed Notes which
have been replaced or paid and Notes for whose payment money has theretofore been deposited in
trust, have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or

(2)  (a) all Notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee or registrar for cancellation have become due and

payable by reason of the making of a notice of redemption or otherwise, will become due and
payable within one year or are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements
satisfactory to the Trustee or the paying agent, as applicable, for the giving of notice of redemption
by the Trustee or the paying agent, as applicable, in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuers,
and the Issuers have or any Guarantor has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the
Trustee (or such other entity designated by the Issuers for this purpose) as trust funds in trust
solely for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes, cash in U.S. dollars, U.S. Government
Securities, or a combination thereof, in such amounts as will be sufficient without consideration of
any reinvestment to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on the Notes not theretofore
delivered to the Trustee or the registrar for cancellation for principal, premium, if any, and accrued
interest to the date of maturity or redemption; provided, that upon any redemption that requires the
payment of the Applicable Premium with respect to the Notes, the amount deposited shall be
sufficient for purposes of the Indenture to the extent that an amount is deposited with the Trustee
(or such other entity designated by the Issuers for this purpose) equal to the Applicable Premium
with respect to the Notes calculated as of the date of the notice of redemption, with any Applicable
Premium Deficit with respect to such series only required to be deposited with the Trustee (or
such other entity designated by the Issuers for this purpose) on or prior to the date of redemption.
Any Applicable Premium Deficit with respect to such series shall be set forth in an Officer’s
Certificate delivered to the Trustee at least one Business Day prior to the date of the deposit of
such Applicable Premium Deficit with respect to such series that confirms that such Applicable
Premium Deficit with respect to the Notes shall be applied toward such redemption;

(b) the Issuers have paid or caused to be paid all sums payable by it under the Indenture; and

(c) the Issuers have delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee (or such other entity
designated by the Issuers for this purpose) to apply the deposited money toward the
payment of the Notes at maturity or the redemption date, as the case may be.

In addition, the Issuers must deliver an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel to the Trustee
stating that all conditions precedent to satisfaction and discharge have been satisfied.

**Amendment, Supplement and Waiver**

Except as provided in the next two succeeding paragraphs, (i) the Indenture, any Guarantee, the Notes and
the Security Documents may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the Required Holders (including
consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes) and (ii) any
existing Default or Event of Default (other than a Default or Event of Default in the payment of the principal of,
premium, if any, or interest on the Notes (which shall be considered waived only with respect to Notes held by
consenting Holders), except a payment default resulting from an acceleration that has been rescinded) or compliance
with any provision of the Indenture, any Guarantee, the Notes or the Security Documents may be waived with the
consent of the Required Holders (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or
exchange offer for, the Notes).

Notwithstanding anything in this “Amendment, Supplement and Waiver” section, the “Events of Default
and Remedies” section, the definition of “Required Holders” or otherwise in the Indenture to the contrary, for


-----

purposes of determining whether the Required Holders have (i) consented (or not consented) to any amendment,
modification, waiver, consent or other action with respect to any of the terms of the Indenture, the Notes, the
Guarantees or the Security Documents or any departure by the Issuers or any Guarantor therefrom, unless the action
in question affects any Affiliated Holder in a disproportionately adverse manner than its effect on the other Holders,
or any plan of reorganization pursuant to any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceeding, (ii) otherwise
acted on any matter related to the Indenture, the Notes, the Security Documents or the Guarantees or (iii) directed or
required the Trustee, the Notes Collateral Agent or any Holder to undertake any action (or refrain from taking any
action) with respect to or under the Indenture, the Notes, the Security Documents or the Guarantees, no Affiliated
Holder shall have any right to consent (or not consent), otherwise act or direct or require the Trustee, the Notes
Collateral Agent or any Holder to take (or refrain from taking) any such action and all Notes held by any Affiliated
Holders shall be deemed to be not outstanding for all purposes of calculating whether the Required Holders have
taken any actions.

Notwithstanding anything in this “Amendment, Supplement and Waiver” section, the “Events of Default
and Remedies” section, the definition of “Required Holders” or otherwise in the Indenture to the contrary, for
purposes of determining whether the Required Holders have (i) consented (or not consented) to any amendment,
modification, waiver, consent or other action with respect to any of the terms of the Indenture, the Notes, the
Guarantees or the Security Documents or any departure by the Issuers or any Guarantor therefrom, (ii) otherwise
acted on any matter related to the Indenture, the Notes, the Guarantees or the Security Documents or (iii) directed or
required the Trustee, the Notes Collateral Agent or any Holder to undertake any action (or refrain from taking any
action) with respect to or under the Indenture, the Notes, the Security Documents or the Guarantees, all Notes held
or beneficially owned by Debt Fund Affiliates may not account for more than 49.9% (pro rata among such Debt
Fund Affiliates) of the Notes of consenting Holders included in determining whether the Required Holders have
consented to any action pursuant to this “Amendment, Supplement and Waiver” section.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this “Amendment, Supplement and Waiver” section, the
“Events of Default and Remedies” section, the definition of “Required Holders” or otherwise in the Indenture, for
purposes of determining whether the Required Holders or any of the Holders, as applicable, have (i) consented (or
not consented) to any amendment, modification, waiver, consent or other action with respect to any of the terms of
the Indenture, the Notes, the Guarantees or the Security Documents or any departure by the Issuers or any Guarantor
therefrom, (ii) otherwise acted on any matter related to the Indenture, the Notes, the Guarantees or the Security
Documents or (iii) directed or required the Trustee or any Holder to undertake any action (or refrain from taking any
action) with respect to or under the Indenture, the Notes, the Guarantees or the Security Documents, all Notes held
or beneficially owned by any Holder (or beneficial owner) or any Affiliate of such Holder (or beneficial owner),
shall not, subject to the proviso to this paragraph below, account for more than 20.0% of the Notes outstanding at
any time (with respect to any Holder (or beneficial owner) (collectively with any Affiliates of such Holder (or
beneficial owner)), the “Voting Cap”) included in determining whether the Required Holders or any of the Holders,
as applicable, have consented to any action (or refrained from taking any action) or provided any consent or waiver
pursuant to this “Amendment, Supplement and Waiver” section. All Notes held or beneficially owned by any Holder
(or beneficial owner) or any Affiliate of such Holder (or beneficial owner) in excess of the Voting Cap shall be
deemed to not be outstanding for all purposes of calculating whether the Required Holders, or with respect to any
other action which requires the consent of the Holders, the Holders, as applicable, have taken any action (or
refrained from taking any action) or provided any consent or waiver; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Issuer may, in its sole discretion, consent to an increase of the Voting Cap for any individual Holder (or
beneficial owner) (collectively with any Affiliates of such Holder (or beneficial owner)) from time to time, which
increase shall become effective with respect to the Voting Cap solely for such Holder (or beneficial owner)
(collectively with any Affiliates of such Holder (or beneficial owner)) (and not, for the avoidance of doubt, with
respect to the Voting Cap for any other Holder (or beneficial owner) or the Affiliates of any other Holder (or
beneficial owner)) upon written notice to the Trustee.

In connection with any action under the Indenture, the Notes, the Guarantees or the Security Documents
that requires a determination of whether the Required Holders or any of the Holders, as applicable, have consented
to such action or otherwise acted on any matter or directed the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent to undertake
any action (or refrain from taking any action), the Issuers shall identify the amount of Notes held or beneficially
owned by an Affiliated Holder or a Debt Fund Affiliate, the amount of the Voting Cap and whether the Voting Cap
is triggered with respect to such consent, action or direction in an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee and


-----

Notes Collateral Agent, upon which the Trustee and Notes Collateral Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely
without investigation.

The Indenture will provide that, without the consent of each affected Holder of a Note (including, for
purposes of this paragraph, Notes held or beneficially owned by the Issuers or their Affiliates), an amendment or
waiver may not, with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the principal amount of such Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment,
supplement or waiver;

(2) reduce the principal of or change the fixed final maturity of any such Note or alter or waive the
provisions with respect to the redemption of such Notes (other than provisions relating to
(a) notice periods (to the extent consistent with applicable requirements of clearing and settlement
systems) for redemption and conditions to redemption (including the timing of the Outside Date
and conditions relating to the Special Mandatory Redemption) and (b) the covenants described
above under the caption “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders”);

(3) reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest on any such Note (other than
provisions relating to the covenants described above under the caption “—Repurchase at the
Option of Holders”);

(4) waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of or premium, if any, or interest
on such Notes, except a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the Required Holders, and a
waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration, or in respect of a covenant or
provision contained in the Indenture, the Notes or any Guarantee which cannot be amended or
modified without the consent of each affected Holder;

(5) make any such Note payable in money other than that stated therein;

(6) make any change in the provisions of the Indenture relating to waivers of past Defaults;

(7) make any change in these amendment and waiver provisions;

(8) amend the contractual right expressly set forth in the Indenture or the Notes of any Holder to
institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with respect to such Holder’s Notes on or
after the due dates therefor;

(9) make any change to or modify the ranking of such Notes that would adversely affect the Holders;
or

(10) except as expressly permitted by the Indenture, modify the Guarantees of any Subsidiary
Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary, or any group of Subsidiary Guarantors that, taken
together (as of the latest consolidated financial statements of the Issuer for a fiscal quarter end
provided as required under “—Reports and Other Information”), would constitute a Significant
Subsidiary, in any manner materially adverse to the Holders of such Notes.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of the Holders of at least 66-2/3% in aggregate
principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, no amendment or waiver may make any change in any Security
Document or the provisions in the Indenture dealing with Collateral or application of trust proceeds of the Collateral
with the effect of releasing the Liens on all or substantially all of the Collateral which secure the Obligations in
respect of the Notes, other than as provided under the terms of the Indenture or the Security Documents.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuers, any Guarantor (with respect to a Guarantee, the Indenture or the
Security Documents to which it is a party), the Trustee and/or the Notes Collateral Agent (and any other agents party


-----

thereto (to the extent applicable)), as the case may be, may amend or supplement the Indenture, the Notes, any
Guarantee or the Security Documents without the consent of any Holder:

(1) to cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect or inconsistency;

(2) to provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes;

(3) to comply with the covenant relating to mergers, amalgamations, consolidations and sales of
assets;

(4) to provide for the assumption of the Issuer’s, the Co-Issuer’s or any Guarantor’s obligations to the
Holders;

(5) to make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the Holders or that does
not materially adversely affect the legal rights under the Indenture of any such Holder;

(6) to add or modify covenants for the benefit of the Holders or to surrender any right or power
conferred upon the Issuers or any Guarantor;

(7) to provide for the issuance of Additional Notes in accordance with the terms of the Indenture;

(8) to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture of a successor
Trustee, a successor Notes Collateral Agent or a successor paying agent thereunder (or any other
applicable agent) pursuant to the requirements thereof;

(9) to add an obligor or a Guarantor under the Indenture;

(10) to conform the text of the Indenture, the Notes, any Guarantees or the Security Documents to any
provision of this “Description of Notes”;

(11) to make any amendment to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the transfer and legending of
Notes as permitted by the Indenture, including, without limitation to facilitate the issuance and
administration of the Notes; provided, however, that such amendment does not materially and
adversely affect the rights of Holders to transfer Notes;

(12) to release any Guarantor from its Guarantee pursuant to the Indenture when permitted or required
by the Indenture;

(13) to release and discharge any Lien securing the Notes when permitted or required by the Indenture
or the Security Documents;

(14) to comply with the rules of any applicable securities depositary;

(15) to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant any other Lien in favor of the Trustee or the Notes
Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Holders, as additional security for the payment and
performance of all or any portion of the Equal Priority Obligations, in any property or assets,
including any which are required to be mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in which a Lien is
required to be granted to or for the benefit of the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent pursuant to
the Indenture, any of the Security Documents or otherwise;

(16) to add Additional Equal Priority Secured Parties to any Security Documents;

(17) (A) to enter into any intercreditor agreement having substantially similar terms with respect to the
Holders as those set forth in the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement, taken as a whole, or any
joinder thereto, (B) to enter into the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement or any intercreditor


-----

agreement having substantially similar terms with respect to the Holders as those set forth in the
Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement, taken as a whole, or any joinder thereto, (C) to enter into the
ABL/Fixed Asset Intercreditor Agreement or any intercreditor agreement having substantially
similar terms with respect to the Holders as those set forth in the ABL/Fixed Asset Intercreditor
Agreement, taken as a whole, or any joinder thereto and (D) to enter into any amendment or
supplement to any intercreditor agreement to add other debt representatives as party thereto and to
make such other changes to the applicable intercreditor agreement, as in the good faith
determination of the Issuer, are required to effectuate the foregoing;

(18) in the case of any Security Document, to include therein any legend required to be set forth therein
pursuant to the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement, the ABL/Fixed Asset Intercreditor
Agreement or any other intercreditor agreement or to modify any such legend as required by the
Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement, the ABL/Fixed Asset Intercreditor Agreement or any
other intercreditor agreement; and

(19) to provide for the succession of any parties to the Security Documents (and other amendments that
are administrative or ministerial in nature) in connection with an amendment, renewal, extension,
substitution, refinancing, restructuring, replacement, supplementing or other modification from
time to time of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Senior ABL Credit Agreement or any
other agreement that is not prohibited by the Indenture.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any
proposed amendment. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment.

For the avoidance of doubt, no amendment to, or deletion of any of the covenants described under, “—
Repurchase at the option of Holders” or “—Certain Covenants,” or action taken in compliance with the covenants in
effect at the time of such action, shall be deemed to impair or affect any legal rights of any Holders of the Notes to
receive payment of principal of or premium, if any, or interest on the Notes or to institute suit for the enforcement of
any payment on or with respect to such Holder’s Notes.

**Notices**

Notices given by publication (including posting of information as contemplated by the covenant described

**Concerning the Trustee**

The Indenture will contain certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee thereunder, should it become a
creditor of the Issuers or a Guarantor, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property
received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other
transactions; however, if it acquires any conflicting interest, it must eliminate such conflict within 90 days or resign.

The Indenture will provide that the Required Holders will have the right to direct the time, method and
place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral
Agent, subject to certain exceptions. The Indenture will provide that in case an Event of Default shall occur (which
shall not be cured) of which the Trustee has received written notice or a responsible officer of the Trustee has actual
knowledge, the Trustee will be required, in the exercise of its power, to use the degree of care of a prudent person in
the conduct of his own affairs. Neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent will be under any obligation to
exercise any of its rights or powers under the Indenture at the request of any Holder of the Notes, unless such Holder
shall have offered, and if requested, provided, to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, security

the period from the date of such redemption notice to     , 2027 is not equal to the constant maturity of a United
States Treasury security for which a yield is given, the Applicable Treasury Rate shall be obtained by linear

include (a) such Investments with average maturities of twelve months or less from the date of acquisition in issuers
rated BBB- (or the equivalent thereof) or better by S&P or Baa3 (or the equivalent thereof) or better by Moody’s, in
each case at the time of such Investment and (b) any Investment with a maturity of more than twelve months that

of such Person and its Restricted Subsidiaries for such period on a consolidated basis and otherwise determined in
accordance with GAAP.

“Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio” means, with respect to any Person for any period, the ratio of
EBITDA of such Person for such period to the Consolidated Interest Expense of such Person for such period. In the
event that such Person or any Restricted Subsidiary incurs, assumes, guarantees, redeems, repays, retires or

of credit facility) or issues or redeems Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock subsequent to the commencement of the
period for which the Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio is being calculated but prior to or substantially
concurrently with the event for which the calculation of the Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio is made (the
“Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio Calculation Date”), then the Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio shall be
calculated giving pro forma effect to such incurrence, assumption, guarantee, redemption, repayment, retirement or
extinguishment of Indebtedness, or such issuance or redemption of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (in each
case, including a pro forma application of the net proceeds therefrom), as if the same had occurred at the beginning
of the applicable four-quarter period, subject, for the avoidance of doubt, to the paragraphs contained in “—Certain
Covenants—Certain Compliance Calculations”; provided, however, that the pro forma calculation of Consolidated
Interest Expense for purposes of the first paragraph under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of
Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” (and for the purposes of other provisions of
the Indenture that refer to such first paragraph) shall not give effect to any Indebtedness being incurred on such date
(or on such other subsequent date which would otherwise require pro forma effect to be given to such incurrence)
pursuant to the second paragraph under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and
Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” (other than Secured Indebtedness incurred pursuant to
subclause (2) of the proviso to clause (14) thereof).

For purposes of making the computation referred to above, Investments, acquisitions, dispositions, mergers,
amalgamations, consolidations, discontinued operations (as determined in accordance with GAAP), operational
changes, Business Expansions, new or revised contracts and other transactions that have been made by or involving
the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries during the four-quarter reference period or subsequent to such
reference period and on or prior to or substantially concurrently with the Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio
Calculation Date shall be calculated on a pro forma basis assuming that all such Investments, acquisitions,
dispositions, mergers, amalgamations, consolidations, discontinued operations, operational changes, Business
Expansions, new or revised contracts and other transactions (and the change in any associated fixed charge
obligations and the change in EBITDA resulting therefrom) had occurred on the first day of the four-quarter
reference period; provided that at the election of the Issuer, such pro forma adjustments shall not be required to be
determined to the extent the aggregate consideration paid in connection with such acquisition or other transaction
was less than the greater of (i) $140.0 million and (ii) 10.0% of LTM EBITDA. If since the beginning of such period
any Person that subsequently became a Restricted Subsidiary or was merged, amalgamated or consolidated with or
into the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries since the beginning of such period shall have made any
Investment, acquisition, disposition, merger, amalgamation, consolidation, discontinued operation, operational
change, Business Expansion or other transaction that would have required adjustment pursuant to this definition,
then the Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio shall be calculated giving pro forma effect thereto for such period as
if such Investment, acquisition, disposition, merger, amalgamation, consolidation, discontinued operation,
operational change, Business Expansion, new or revised contract or other transaction had occurred at the beginning
of the applicable four-quarter period.

For purposes of this definition, whenever pro forma effect is to be given to an Investment, acquisition,
disposition, merger, amalgamation, consolidation, discontinued operation, operational change, Business Expansion,
new or revised contract or other transaction (including the Transactions), the pro forma calculations shall be made in


-----

good faith by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries (and may
include, for the avoidance of doubt, cost savings, operating expense reductions and product margin, and other
synergies resulting from such Investment, acquisition, disposition, merger, amalgamation, consolidation,
discontinued operation, operational change, Business Expansion, new or revised contract or other transaction
(including the Transactions) which is being given pro forma effect) calculated in accordance with and permitted by
clauses (1)(h) and (1)(o) of the definition of “EBITDA.” If any Indebtedness bears a floating or formula rate of
interest and is being given pro forma effect, the interest on such Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate in
effect on the Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio Calculation Date had been the applicable rate for the entire
period (taking into account any Hedging Obligations applicable to such Indebtedness). Interest on a Financing Lease
Obligation shall be deemed to accrue at an interest rate reasonably determined by a responsible financial or
accounting officer of the Issuer to be the rate of interest implicit in such Financing Lease Obligation in accordance
with GAAP. For purposes of making the computation referred to above, interest on any Indebtedness under a
revolving credit facility computed on a pro forma basis shall be computed based upon the average daily balance of
such Indebtedness during the applicable period except as set forth in the first paragraph of this definition. Interest on
Indebtedness that may optionally be determined at an interest rate based upon a factor of a prime or similar rate, a
eurocurrency interbank offered rate, or other rate, shall be deemed to have been based upon the rate actually chosen,
or, if none, then based upon such optional rate chosen as the Issuer may designate.

“Consolidated Interest Expense” means, with respect to any Person for any period, without duplication,
the sum of:

(1) consolidated cash interest expense of such Person and its Restricted Subsidiaries for such period
with respect to all outstanding Indebtedness to the extent included in the calculation of
Consolidated Total Indebtedness, to the extent such expense was deducted (and not added back) in
computing Consolidated Net Income (including (a) amortization of original issue discount
resulting from the issuance of Indebtedness at less than par, (b) all commissions, discounts and
other fees and charges owed with respect to letters of credit or bankers acceptances, (c) [reserved],
(d) the interest component of Financing Lease Obligations, and (e) net payments, if any made (less
net payments, if any, received), pursuant to interest rate Hedging Obligations with respect to
Indebtedness, and excluding (o) annual agency or similar fees paid to the administrative agents,
collateral agents and other agents under any Credit Facilities, (p) any additional interest with
respect to failure to comply with any registration rights agreement owing with respect to any
securities, (q) costs associated with obtaining Hedging Obligations, (r) any expense resulting from
the discounting of any Indebtedness in connection with the application of recapitalization
accounting or, if applicable, purchase or acquisition accounting in connection with the 2023
Transactions, any acquisition or other transaction, (s) penalties and interest relating to taxes,
(t) any “additional interest” or “liquidated damages” with respect to other securities for failure to
timely comply with registration rights obligations, (u) amortization or expensing of deferred
financing fees, amendment and consent fees, debt issuance costs, commissions, fees, expenses and
discounted liabilities and any other amounts of non-cash interest, (v) any expensing of bridge,
commitment and other financing fees and any other fees related to the 2023 Transactions, any
acquisitions after the Acquisition Date or other transaction, (w) Securitization Fees, commissions,
discounts, yield, make-whole premium and other fees and charges (including any interest expense)
incurred in connection with any Qualified Securitization Facility, (x) any accretion of accrued
interest on discounted liabilities and any prepayment, make-whole or breakage premium, penalty
or cost, (y) interest expense attributable to a parent entity resulting from push-down accounting
and (z) any lease, rental or other expense in connection with a Non-Financing Lease Obligation);
plus

(2) consolidated cash interest of such Person and its Restricted Subsidiaries for such period, whether
paid or accrued (but excluding for the avoidance of doubt, any paid-in-kind interest, and excluding
any interest capitalized, accrued, accreted or paid in respect of Subordinated Shareholder
Funding); less

(3) interest income of such Person and its Restricted Subsidiaries for such period.


-----

For purposes of this definition, interest on a Financing Lease Obligation shall be deemed to accrue at an
interest rate reasonably determined by such Person to be the rate of interest implicit in such Financing Lease
Obligation in accordance with GAAP (or, if not implicit, as otherwise determined in accordance with GAAP).

“Consolidated Equal Priority Debt Ratio” means, as of any date of determination, the ratio of (1)(a)
Consolidated Equal Priority Net Debt minus Cash Equivalents that would be stated on the balance sheet of the Issuer
and its Restricted Subsidiaries as of such date of determination, in each case with such pro forma adjustments as are
appropriate and consistent with the pro forma adjustment provisions set forth in the definition of Consolidated
Interest Coverage Ratio and as determined in good faith by the Issuer and (b) in connection with the incurrence of
any Indebtedness pursuant to the first or second paragraph under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence
of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” or the creation or incurrence of any Lien
pursuant to the definition of “Permitted Liens,” the Reserved Indebtedness Amount relating to Consolidated Equal
Priority Net Debt as of such date of determination, in each case with such pro forma adjustments as are appropriate
and consistent with the pro forma adjustment provisions set forth in the definition of Consolidated Interest Coverage
Ratio and as determined in good faith by the Issuer to (2) LTM EBITDA. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, in no event shall the proceeds of, commitments under, or incurrences of any Indebtedness under, the Senior
ABL Credit Facility, any other Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations or any other revolving credit facility, be
included in the calculation of Consolidated Equal Priority Debt Ratio.

“Consolidated Equal Priority Net Debt” means Consolidated Total Indebtedness (other than any

For the avoidance of doubt, unless otherwise specified, any entity that is owned at a 50.0% or less level (as

“Trust Indenture Act” means the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (15 U.S.C. §§ 77aaa-77bbbb).

“Uniform Commercial Code” or “UCC” means (i) the Uniform Commercial Code or any successor
provision thereof as the same may from time to time be in effect in the State of New York or (ii) the Uniform
Commercial Code (or similar code or statute) of another jurisdiction, to the extent it applies to any item or items of
Collateral. References in the Indenture and the other Security Documents to specific sections of the Uniform
Commercial Code are based on the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in the State of New York on the Issue
Date. In the event such Uniform Commercial Code is amended or another Uniform Commercial Code described in
clause (ii) is applicable, such section reference shall be deemed to be references to the comparable section in such

acquired or newly formed Subsidiary) to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary; provided that either (a) the Subsidiary to be
so designated has total consolidated assets of $1,000 or less or (b) if the Subsidiary to be so designated has total
consolidated assets in excess of $1,000, such designation complies with the covenant described under “—Certain
Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments.” If, at any time, any Unrestricted Subsidiary would fail to meet the
preceding requirements as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, it will thereafter cease to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary for
purposes of the Indenture and any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary will be deemed to be incurred by a Restricted
Subsidiary of the Issuer as of such date and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be incurred as of such date
under the covenant described under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness
and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock,” the Issuer will be in Default of such covenant.

The Issuer may designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary; provided that,
immediately after giving effect to such designation, (i) no Default shall have occurred and be continuing and (ii) (x)
any outstanding Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary would be permitted to be incurred by a Restricted
Subsidiary under the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness
and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” (including pursuant to clause (14) of the second paragraph
thereof treating such redesignation as an acquisition for the purpose of such clause) and shall be deemed to be
incurred thereunder and (y) all Liens encumbering the assets of such Unrestricted Subsidiary would be permitted to
be incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary under the covenant “—Certain Covenants—Liens” and shall be deemed to be
incurred thereunder, in each case calculated on a pro forma basis as if such designation had occurred at the
beginning of the applicable reference period.


-----

Any such designation by the Issuer shall be notified by the Issuer to the Trustee by promptly delivering to
the Trustee a copy of the resolution of the Board of the Issuer or any direct or indirect parent of the Issuer giving

any such U.S. Government Securities or a specific payment of principal of or interest on any such U.S. Government
Securities held by such custodian for the account of the holder of such depository receipt; provided, that (except as
required by law) such custodian is not authorized to make any deduction from the amount payable to the holder of
such depository receipt from any amount received by the custodian in respect of the U.S. Government Securities or
the specific payment of principal of or interest on the U.S. Government Securities evidenced by such depository
receipt.

“Voting Stock” of any Person as of any date means the Capital Stock of such Person that is at the time
entitled to vote in the election of the Board of such Person.

“Weighted Average Life to Maturity” means, when applied to any Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock, as the case may be, at any date, the quotient obtained by dividing:

(1) the sum of the products of the number of years from the date of determination to the date of each
successive scheduled principal payment of such Indebtedness or redemption or similar payment
with respect to such Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock multiplied by the amount of such

(2) the sum of all such payments;

_provided, that for purposes of determining the Weighted Average Life to Maturity of any Indebtedness that is being_

replacement, refunding, refinancing, renewal or defeasance shall be disregarded.

**BOOK ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM**

The notes offered and sold to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A (“Rule 144A Notes”)
will be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Rule
144A Global Notes”). The Rule 144A Global Notes will be deposited with a custodian for DTC, and registered in
the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of DTC.

The notes sold in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S (“Regulation S Notes”) will be
represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Regulation S
Global Notes” and, together with the Rule 144A Global Notes, the “Global Notes”). The Regulation S Global Notes
will be registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of DTC and deposited with a custodian for DTC, for credit
to Euroclear and Clearstream. The Regulation S Global Notes will initially be represented by temporary global notes
in form without interest coupons (the “Temporary Regulation S Global Notes”). After the 40th day following the
later of the commencement of this offering and the closing of this offering (such period through and including such
40th day, the “Distribution Compliance Period”), the Temporary Regulation S Global Notes may be exchanged for
permanent Regulation S Global Notes.

**The Global Notes**

**_General_**

The Global Notes will be deposited upon issuance with U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association,
as trustee for the notes (the “Trustee”) as custodian for The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”), and registered in
the name of DTC or its nominee, in each case for credit to an account of a Participant (as defined below) or Indirect
Participant (as defined below) in DTC as described below. The notes will be issued at the closing of this offering
only against payment in immediately available funds. Except as set forth below, the notes will be issued in
registered, global form in minimum denominations of $2,000 and any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof.

Until the end of the Distribution Compliance Period, beneficial interests in the Regulation S Global Notes
may be held only through Euroclear and Clearstream (as Indirect Participants in DTC), unless transferred to a person
that takes delivery through a Rule 144A Global Note in accordance with the certification requirements described
below.

Beneficial interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes may not be exchanged for beneficial interests in the
Regulation S Global Notes at any time except in the limited circumstances described below. See “—Exchanges
among Global Notes.”

Except as set forth below, the Global Notes may be transferred, in whole and not in part, only to another
nominee of DTC or to a successor of DTC or its nominee. Beneficial interests in the Global Notes may not be
exchanged for notes in certificated form (“Certificated Notes”) except in the limited circumstances described below.
See “—Exchange of Global Notes for Certificated Notes.” Except in the limited circumstances described below,
owners of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of notes in
certificated form.

Rule 144A Notes (including beneficial interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes) will be subject to certain
restrictions on transfer and will bear a restrictive legend as described under “Transfer restrictions.” Regulation S
Notes will also be subject to certain restrictions on transfer and will also bear the legend as described under
“Transfer restrictions.” In addition, transfers of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the
applicable rules and procedures of DTC and its direct or Indirect Participants (including, if applicable, those of
Euroclear or Clearstream), which may change from time to time.

**_Depositary Procedures_**

The following description of the operations and procedures of DTC is provided solely as a matter of
convenience. These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the respective settlement systems and


-----

are subject to changes by them. The Issuers, Trustee, Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent take no
responsibility for these operations and procedures and urge investors to contact the system or their Participants
directly to discuss these matters.

DTC has advised us that DTC is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of
New York, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal
Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the Uniform Commercial Code and a “clearing
agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC was created to hold
securities for its participating organizations (collectively, the “Participants”) and to facilitate the clearance and
settlement of transactions in those securities between Participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts
of its Participants. The Participants include securities brokers and dealers (including the initial purchasers), banks,
trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access to DTC’s system is also available to
other entities such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial
relationship with a Participant, either directly or indirectly (collectively, the “Indirect Participants”). Persons who
are not Participants may beneficially own securities held by or on behalf of DTC only through the Participants or the
Indirect Participants. The ownership interests in, and transfers of ownership interests in, each security held by or on
behalf of DTC are recorded on the records of the Participants and Indirect Participants.

DTC has also advised us that, pursuant to procedures established by it:

(1) upon deposit of the Global Notes, DTC will credit the accounts of Participants designated by the
initial purchasers with portions of the principal amount of the Global Notes; and

(2) ownership of these interests in the Global Notes will be shown on, and the transfer of ownership
of these interests will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to the
Participants) or by the Participants and the Indirect Participants (with respect to other owners of
beneficial interests in the Global Notes).

Investors in the Rule 144A Global Notes who are Participants in DTC’s system may hold their interests
therein directly through DTC. Investors in the Rule 144A Global Notes who are not Participants may hold their
interests therein indirectly through organizations (including Euroclear and Clearstream) which are Participants in
such system. Investors in the Regulation S Global Notes must initially hold their interests therein through Euroclear
or Clearstream, if they are Participants in such systems, or indirectly through organizations that are Participants.
After the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period (but not earlier), investors may also hold interests in the
Regulation S Global Notes through Participants in the DTC system other than Euroclear and Clearstream. Euroclear
and Clearstream will hold interests in the Regulation S Global Notes on behalf of their Participants through
customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective depositories, which are
Euroclear Bank SA/NV, as operator of Euroclear, and Citibank, N.A., as operator of Clearstream. All interests in a
Global Note may be subject to the procedures and requirements of DTC. Those interests held through Euroclear or
Clearstream may also be subject to the procedures and requirements of such systems. The laws of some states
require that certain Persons take physical delivery in definitive form of securities that they own. Consequently, the
ability to transfer beneficial interests in a Global Note to such Persons will be limited to that extent. Because DTC
can act only on behalf of Participants, which in turn act on behalf of Indirect Participants, the ability of a Person
having beneficial interests in a Global Note to pledge such interests to Persons that do not participate in the DTC
system, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interests, may be affected by the lack of a physical certificate
evidencing such interests.

**Except as described below, beneficial owners of an interest in the Global Notes will not have notes**
**registered in their names, will not receive physical delivery of notes in certificated form and will not be**
**considered the registered owners or “holders” thereof under the indenture that will govern the notes for any**
**purpose.**

Payments in respect of the principal of, and interest and premium, if any, on a Global Note registered in the
name of DTC or its nominee will be payable to DTC in its capacity as the registered holder under the indenture that
will govern the notes. Under the terms of the indenture that will govern the notes, the Issuers and the Trustee will
treat the Persons in whose names the notes, including the Global Notes, are registered as the owners of such notes


-----

for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, none of the Issuers, the Trustee,
Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent, nor any agent of their agents, has or will have any responsibility or
liability for:

(1) any aspect of DTC’s records or any Participant’s or Indirect Participant’s records relating to or
payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in the Global Notes or for
maintaining, supervising or reviewing any of DTC’s records or any Participant’s or Indirect
Participant’s records relating to the beneficial ownership interests in the Global Notes; or

(2) any other matter relating to the actions and practices of DTC or any of its Participants or Indirect
Participants.

DTC has advised us that its current practice, upon receipt of any payment in respect of securities such as
the notes (including principal and interest), is to credit the accounts of the relevant Participants with the payment on
the payment date unless DTC has reason to believe it will not receive payment on such payment date. Each relevant
Participant is credited with an amount proportionate to its beneficial ownership of an interest in the principal amount
of the relevant security as shown on the records of DTC. Payments by the Participants and the Indirect Participants
to the beneficial owners of notes will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices and will be the
responsibility of the Participants or the Indirect Participants and will not be the responsibility of DTC, the Trustee or
the Issuers. None of the Issuers, the Trustee or any of the agents will be liable for any delay by DTC or any of its
Participants in identifying the beneficial owners of the notes, and the Issuers and the Trustee may conclusively rely
on and will be protected in relying on instructions from DTC or its nominee for all purposes.

Subject to the transfer restrictions set forth under “Transfer Restrictions,” transfers between Participants in
DTC will be effected in accordance with DTC’s procedures, and will be settled in same-day funds, and transfers
between Participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in accordance with their respective rules and
operating procedures.

DTC has advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of notes only at the
direction of one or more Participants to whose account DTC has credited the interests in the Global Notes and only
in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of the notes as to which such Participant or Participants
has or have given such direction. However, if there is an event of default under the notes, DTC reserves the right to
exchange the Global Notes for legended notes in certificated form, and to distribute such notes to its Participants.

Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the notes described herein, cross-market
transfers between DTC Participants, on the one hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream Participants, on the other hand,
will be effected through DTC in accordance with DTC’s rules on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case
may be, by their respective depositaries; however, such cross-market transactions will require delivery of
instructions to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by the counterparty in such system in accordance with
the rules and procedures and within the established deadlines (Brussels time) of such system. Euroclear or
Clearstream, as the case may be, will, if the transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to its
respective depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving interests in the
relevant Global Note in DTC, and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-day
funds settlement applicable to DTC. Euroclear Participants and Clearstream Participants may not deliver instructions
directly to the depositories for Euroclear or Clearstream.

Although DTC has agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests in the
Global Notes among Participants in DTC, it is under no obligation to perform such procedures, and such procedures
may be discontinued or changed at any time. Neither the Issuers nor the Trustee, Dollar Paying Agent, Dollar
Registrar and Transfer Agent, nor any of their respective agents, will have any responsibility for the performance by
DTC or its Participants or Indirect Participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures
governing their operations.


-----

**_Exchange of Global Notes for Certificated Notes_**

A Global Note is exchangeable for Certificated Notes if:

(1) DTC (a) notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for the Global Notes or
(b) has ceased to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act and, in each case, a
successor depositary is not appointed;

(2) we, at our option, notify the Trustee in writing that we elect to cause the issuance of the
Certificated Notes; or

(3) there has occurred and is continuing a Default with respect to the Global Notes.

In addition, beneficial interests in a Global Note may be exchanged for Certificated Notes upon prior
written notice given to the Trustee by or on behalf of DTC in accordance with the indenture that will govern the
notes. In all cases, Certificated Notes delivered in exchange for any Global Note or beneficial interests in Global
Notes will be registered in the names, and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of the
depositary (in accordance with its customary procedures) and will bear the applicable restrictive legend referred to
in “Transfer Restrictions,” unless that legend is not required by applicable law.

**_Exchange of Certificated Notes for Global Notes_**

Certificated Notes may not be exchanged for beneficial interests in any Global Note unless the transferor
first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form to be provided in each indenture that will govern the
notes) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such notes.
See “Transfer Restrictions.”

**_Exchanges Among Global Notes_**

Prior to the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period, beneficial interests in a Regulation S Global
Note may be transferred only to non-U.S. persons under Regulation S, qualified institutional buyers under Rule
144A or institutional accredited investors. Beneficial interests in a Regulation S Global Note may be exchanged for
beneficial interests in a Rule 144A Global Note only if:

(1) such exchange occurs in connection with a transfer of the relevant notes pursuant to Rule 144A;
and

(2) the transferor first delivers to the Issuers and the Trustee a written certificate (in the form to be
provided in the indenture) to the effect that the relevant notes are being transferred to a Person:

who the transferor reasonably believes to be a qualified institutional buyer within the meaning of Rule 144A;
purchasing for its own account or the account of a qualified institutional buyer in a transaction meeting the
requirements of Rule 144A; and in accordance with all applicable securities laws of the states of the United States
and other jurisdictions.

Beneficial interest in a Rule 144A Global Note may be transferred to a Person who takes delivery in the
form of an interest in the Regulation S Global Note, whether before or after the expiration of the Distribution
Compliance Period, only if the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in
the indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Rule 903 or 904 of Regulation S or
Rule 144 (if available) and that, if such transfer occurs prior to the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period,
the interest transferred will be held immediately thereafter through Euroclear or Clearstream.

Transfers involving exchanges of beneficial interests among the Regulation S Global Notes and the Rule
144A Global Notes will be effected in DTC by means of an instruction originated by the DTC Participant through
the DTC Deposit/Withdraw at Custodian system. Accordingly, in connection with any such transfer, appropriate


-----

adjustments will be made to reflect the changes in the principal amounts of the Regulation S Global Note and the
Rule 144A Global Note, as applicable. Any beneficial interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a
Person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in another Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be an
interest in such Global Note and will become an interest in such other Global Note and, accordingly, will thereafter
be subject to all transfer restrictions and other procedures applicable to beneficial interests in such other Global Note
for so long as it remains such an interest. The policies and practices of DTC may prohibit transfers of beneficial
interests in the Regulation S Global Note prior to the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period.

**_Same Day Settlement and Payment_**

We will make payments in respect of the notes represented by the Global Notes (including principal,
premium, if any, and interest) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the
Global Note holder. We will make all payments of principal, interest and premium, if any, with respect to
Certificated Notes by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the holders of the
Certificated Notes or, if no such account is specified, by mailing a check to each such holder’s registered address.
The notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be made eligible to trade in DTC’s Same-Day Funds
Settlement System, and any permitted secondary market trading activity in such notes will, therefore, be required by
DTC to be settled in immediately available funds. We expect that secondary trading in any Certificated Notes will
also be settled in immediately available funds.

Because of time zone differences, the securities account of a Euroclear or Clearstream Participant
purchasing an interest in a Global Note from a DTC Participant will be credited, and any such crediting will be
reported to the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream Participant, during the securities settlement processing day (which
must be a business day for Euroclear and Clearstream) immediately following the settlement date of DTC. DTC has
advised the Issuers that cash received in Euroclear or Clearstream as a result of sales of interests in a Global Note by
or through a Euroclear or Clearstream Participant to a Participant will be received with value on the settlement date
of DTC but will be available in the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream cash account only as of the business day for
Euroclear or Clearstream following DTC’s settlement date.

**CERTAIN UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a summary of certain United States federal income tax consequences of the purchase,
ownership and disposition of the notes as of the date hereof, but it does not purport to be a complete analysis of all
the potential tax considerations.

This summary deals only with notes that are held as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) (generally, property held for investment), by persons
who purchase the notes for cash upon original issuance at their “issue price” (the first price at which a substantial
amount of the notes is sold for cash to investors, excluding sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or
organizations acting in the capacity of underwriter, placement agent or wholesaler), and does not represent a detailed
description of the United States federal income tax consequences applicable to you if you are subject to special
treatment under the United States federal income tax laws, including if you are:

    - a dealer or broker in securities or currencies;

    - a financial institution;

    - a regulated investment company;

    - a real estate investment trust;

    - a tax-exempt organization;

    - an insurance company;

    - a person holding the notes as part of a hedging, integrated, conversion or constructive sale transaction
or a straddle;

    - a trader in securities that has elected the mark-to-market method of accounting for your securities;

    - a person liable for alternative minimum tax;

    - a partnership or other pass-through entity for United States federal income tax purposes (or an investor
in such an entity);

    - a United States Holder (as defined below) whose “functional currency” is not the U.S. dollar;

    - a “controlled foreign corporation”;

    - a “passive foreign investment company”;

    - a person required to accelerate the recognition of any item of gross income with respect to the notes as
a result of such income being recognized on an applicable financial statement; or

    - a United States expatriate.

This summary is based upon provisions of the Code, and regulations, rulings and judicial decisions as of
the date hereof. Those authorities are subject to differing interpretations and may be changed, perhaps retroactively,
so as to result in United States federal income tax consequences different from those summarized below. We have
not sought and do not intend to seek any rulings from the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) regarding the matters
discussed below. There can be no assurance that the IRS will agree with this summary or that a court would not
sustain any challenge by the IRS in the event of litigation.


-----

If a partnership (or other entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for United States federal income tax
purposes) holds the notes, the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the
activities of the partnership. If you are a partnership or a partner of a partnership considering an investment in the
notes, you should consult your tax advisors.

This discussion does not contain a detailed description of all the United States federal income tax
consequences to you in light of your particular circumstances and does not address the Medicare contribution tax on
net investment income, United States federal tax laws other than those pertaining to income tax (including estate and
gift tax laws), or the effects of any state, local or non-United States tax laws. If you are considering the purchase
**of notes, you should consult your own tax advisors concerning the particular United States federal income tax**
**consequences to you of the ownership of the notes, as well as the consequences to you arising under other**
**United States federal tax laws and the laws of any other taxing jurisdiction.**

**Effects of Certain Contingencies**

In certain circumstances (see, for example, “Description of Notes—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—
Change of Control Triggering Event” and “Description of Notes—Escrow of Gross Proceeds; Special Mandatory
Redemption”), we may be required to redeem or repurchase the notes significantly earlier than their scheduled
maturity date and/or to pay amounts in excess of stated interest and principal on the notes. The foregoing
contingencies may implicate the provisions of the United States Treasury regulations relating to “contingent
payment debt instruments.” However, we believe and intend to take the position that the foregoing contingencies
should not cause the notes to be subject to the contingent payment debt instrument rules. Our position is binding on
you unless you disclose that you are taking a contrary position in the manner required by applicable United States
Treasury regulations. However, the position is not binding on the IRS. If the IRS were to successfully challenge this
position, you might be required to, among other things, accrue interest income at a higher rate than the stated interest
rate on the notes, and to treat as ordinary income (rather than capital gain) any gain recognized on the taxable
disposition of a note. The remainder of this discussion assumes that the notes will not be treated as contingent
payment debt instruments. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the potential application to the
notes of the contingent payment debt instrument rules and the consequences thereof.

**Consequences to United States Holders**

The following is a summary of certain United States federal income tax consequences that will apply to you
if you are a United States Holder.

As used herein, “United States Holder” means a beneficial owner of the notes that is, for United States
federal income tax purposes, any of the following:

    - an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;

    - a corporation (or any other entity treated as a corporation for United States federal income tax
purposes) created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the
District of Columbia;

    - an estate the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its
source; or

    - a trust if it (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or more
United States persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) has a
valid election in effect under applicable United States Treasury regulations to be treated as a United
States person.


-----

**_Payments of Stated Interest_**

Stated interest on a note will generally be taxable to you as ordinary income at the time it is paid or accrued
in accordance with your method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes.

**_Sale, Exchange, Retirement, Redemption or other Taxable Disposition of Notes_**

Upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a note, you generally will
recognize gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount you realize upon the sale, exchange,
retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition (less an amount attributable to any accrued but unpaid stated
interest, which will be treated in the manner described above under “—Payments of Stated Interest”) and your
adjusted tax basis in the note. Your adjusted tax basis in a note will generally be your cost for that note. Any gain or
loss you recognize will generally be capital gain or loss and will generally be long-term capital gain or loss if you
have held the note for more than one year. Long-term capital gains of non-corporate United States Holders
(including individuals) are eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to
limitations.

**Consequences to Non-United States Holders**

The following is a summary of certain United States federal income tax consequences that will apply to you
if you are a Non-United States Holder. “Non-United States Holder” means a beneficial owner of the notes (other
than an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes) that is not a
United States Holder.

**_United States Federal Withholding Tax_**

Subject to the discussions of backup withholding and FATCA below, United States federal income or
withholding tax will not apply to any payment of interest on the notes under the “portfolio interest rule,” provided
that:

    - interest paid on the notes is not effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the
United States;

    - you do not actually or constructively own 10% or more of the capital or profits interest of the Issuer or
JV NewCo within the meaning of the Code and applicable United States Treasury regulations;

    - you are not a controlled foreign corporation that is actually or constructively related to the Issuer or JV
NewCo within the meaning of Section 864(d)(4) of the Code;

    - you are not a bank whose receipt of interest on the notes is described in Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the
Code; and

    - either (a) you provide your name and address on an applicable IRS Form W-8, and certify, under
penalties of perjury, that you are not a United States person as defined under the Code or (b) you hold
your notes through certain foreign intermediaries and satisfy the certification requirements of
applicable United States Treasury regulations. Special certification rules apply to Non-United States
Holders that are pass-through entities rather than corporations or individuals.

If you cannot satisfy the requirements described above, payments of interest made to you will be subject to
a 30% United States federal withholding tax, unless you provide the applicable withholding agent with a properly
executed:

    - IRS Form W-8BEN or Form W-8BEN-E (or other applicable form) claiming an exemption from or
reduction in withholding under the benefit of an applicable income tax treaty; or


-----

    - IRS Form W-8ECI (or other applicable form) certifying that interest paid on the notes is not subject to
withholding tax because it is effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the
United States (as discussed below under “—United States Federal Income Tax”).

The 30% United States federal withholding tax generally will not apply to any payment of principal or gain
that you realize on the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a note, except with
respect to amounts attributable to accrued and unpaid interest (which will generally be treated as described above).
If you are eligible for an exemption from or reduced rate of United States federal withholding tax under an
applicable income tax treaty, you may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld by timely filing an
appropriate claim with the IRS. You should consult your own tax advisors regarding your entitlement to benefits
under an applicable income tax treaty and the requirements for claiming any such benefits.

**_United States Federal Income Tax_**

If you are engaged in a trade or business in the United States and interest on the notes is effectively
connected with the conduct of that trade or business (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is
attributable to a United States permanent establishment or fixed base), then you will generally be subject to United
States federal income tax on that interest on a net income basis in the same manner as if you were a United States
person as defined under the Code (although you will be exempt from the 30% withholding tax described above,
provided the certification requirements discussed above in “—United States Federal Withholding Tax” are
satisfied). In addition, if you are a foreign corporation, you may be subject to a branch profits tax equal to 30% (or
lower applicable income tax treaty rate) of your effectively connected earnings and profits, subject to adjustments.

Subject to the discussions of backup withholding and FATCA below, and except with respect to amounts
attributable to accrued and unpaid interest (which will generally be treated as described above under “—United
States Federal Withholding Tax”), any gain realized on the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable
disposition of a note generally will not be subject to United States federal income tax unless:

    - the gain is effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the United States (and, if
required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a United States permanent establishment
or fixed base), in which case such gain will generally be subject to United States federal income tax
(and possibly branch profits tax) in the same manner as effectively connected interest as described
above; or

    - you are an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of
that disposition and certain other conditions are met, in which case, unless an applicable income tax
treaty provides otherwise, you will generally be subject to a 30% United States federal income tax on
any gain recognized, which may be offset by certain of your United States source losses, if any.

**Information Reporting and Backup Withholding**

**_United States Holders_**

In general, information reporting requirements will apply to payments of interest and principal on a note
and the proceeds from the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a note paid to you,
unless you establish that you are an exempt recipient. A backup withholding tax may apply to such payments if you
fail to provide a taxpayer identification number and a certification that you are not subject to backup withholding, or
if you fail to report in full dividend and interest income.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules
may be allowed as a refund or a credit against your United States federal income tax liability provided the required
information is timely furnished to the IRS.


-----

**_Non-United States Holders_**

Interest paid to you and the amount of tax, if any, withheld with respect to those payments generally will be
reported to the IRS and you. These reporting requirements apply regardless of whether withholding was reduced or
eliminated by an applicable income tax treaty. Copies of the information returns reporting such interest payments
and any withholding may also be made available to the tax authorities in the country in which you reside under the
provisions of an applicable income tax treaty or agreement with those tax authorities.

In general, you will not be subject to backup withholding with respect to payments on the notes that we
make to you provided that the applicable withholding agent does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that
you are a United States person as defined under the Code, and such withholding agent has received from you the
statement described above in the fifth bullet point under “Consequences to Non-United States Holders—United
States Federal Withholding Tax.”

Information reporting and, depending on the circumstances, backup withholding will apply to the proceeds
of a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of notes made within the United States or
conducted through certain United States-related financial intermediaries, unless you certify to the payor under
penalties of perjury that you are a Non-United States Holder (and the payor does not have actual knowledge or
reason to know that you are a United States person as defined under the Code), or you otherwise establish an
exemption.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules
will be allowed as a refund or a credit against your United States federal income tax liability, if any, provided the
required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

**Additional Withholding Requirements**

Under Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (such Sections and the United States Treasury regulations
promulgated thereunder, collectively, commonly referred to as “FATCA”), a 30% United States federal withholding
tax may apply to any interest paid on the notes to (i) a “foreign financial institution” (as specifically defined in the
Code and regardless of whether such foreign financial institution is the beneficial owner or an intermediary) which
does not provide sufficient documentation, typically on IRS Form W-8BEN-E, evidencing either (x) an exemption
from FATCA, or (y) its compliance (or deemed compliance) with FATCA (which may alternatively be in the form
of compliance with an intergovernmental agreement with the United States) in a manner which avoids withholding,
or (ii) a “non-financial foreign entity” (as specifically defined in the Code and regardless of whether such nonfinancial foreign entity is the beneficial owner or an intermediary) which does not provide sufficient documentation,
typically on IRS Form W-8BEN-E, evidencing either (x) an exemption from FATCA, or (y) adequate information
regarding certain substantial United States beneficial owners of such entity (if any). If an interest payment is both
subject to withholding under FATCA and subject to the withholding tax discussed above under “Consequences to
Non-United States Holders—United States Federal Withholding Tax,” an applicable withholding agent may credit
the withholding under FATCA against, and therefore reduce, such other withholding tax. While withholding under
FATCA would also have applied to payments of gross proceeds from the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or
other taxable disposition of the notes, proposed United States Treasury regulations (upon which taxpayers may rely
until final regulations are issued) eliminate FATCA withholding on payments of gross proceeds (other than amounts
treated as interest) entirely. Foreign financial institutions located in jurisdictions that have an intergovernmental
agreement with the United States governing FATCA may be subject to different rules. You should consult your own
tax advisors regarding these rules and whether they may be relevant to your purchase, ownership and disposition of
the notes.

**CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a summary of certain considerations associated with the purchase and holding of the notes
by (i) “employee benefit plans” within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA that are subject to Title I of ERISA,
(ii) plans, individual retirement accounts and other arrangements that are subject to Section 4975 of the Code or
provisions under any other U.S. or non-U.S. federal, state, local or other laws or regulations that are similar to the
fiduciary responsibility or prohibited transaction provisions of Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code
(collectively, “Similar Laws”) and (iii) entities whose underlying assets are considered to include the assets of any
of the foregoing described in clauses (i) or (ii), pursuant to ERISA or otherwise (each of the foregoing described in
clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) referred to herein as a “Plan”).

**General Fiduciary Matters**

ERISA and the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of a Plan subject to Title I of
ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (a “Covered Plan”) and prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of a
Covered Plan and its fiduciaries or other interested parties. Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises
any discretionary authority or control over the administration of a Covered Plan or the management or disposition of
the assets of a Covered Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation to such a Covered
Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the Covered Plan.

In considering an investment in the notes of a portion of the assets of any Plan, a Plan fiduciary should
determine whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the
applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law relating to the fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including,
without limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of
ERISA, the Code and any other applicable Similar Laws.

**Prohibited Transaction Issues**

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit Covered Plans from engaging in specified
transactions involving plan assets with persons or entities who are “parties in interest,” within the meaning of
Section 3(14) of ERISA, or “disqualified persons,” within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless an
exemption is available. A party in interest or disqualified person who engaged in a non-exempt prohibited
transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. In addition,
the fiduciary of the Covered Plan that engaged in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to
penalties and liabilities under ERISA and/or the Code.

The purchase and/or holding of the notes by a Covered Plan with respect to which an Issuer, a Sponsor, a
guarantor, an initial purchaser, the Trustee or any of their respective affiliates (collectively, the “Transaction
Parties”) is considered a party in interest or a disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect
prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the notes are acquired
and held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. In this
regard, the U.S. Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions (“PTCEs”) that may apply
to the purchase and holding of the notes. These class exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 respecting
transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1 respecting insurance
company pooled separate accounts, PTCE 91-38 respecting bank collective investment funds, PTCE 95-60
respecting life insurance company general accounts and PTCE 96-23 respecting transactions determined by in-house
asset managers. In addition, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code provide relief from
the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code for certain transactions, provided that
neither the issuer of the securities nor any of its affiliates (directly or indirectly) have or exercise any discretionary
authority or control or render any investment advice with respect to the assets of any Covered Plan involved in the
transaction and provided further that the Covered Plan pays no more than adequate consideration in connection with
the transaction. Each of the above-noted exemptions contains conditions and limitations on its application.
Fiduciaries of Covered Plans considering purchasing and/or holding the notes in reliance on these or any other
exemption should carefully review the exemption in consultation with its own legal advisors to assure it is
applicable. There can be no assurance that any class exemption, statutory exemption or any other exemption will be


-----

available with respect to any particular transaction involving the notes, or that if an exemption is available, it will
cover all aspects of any particular transaction.

Plans that are governmental plans, certain church plans and non-U.S. plans may not be subject to the
fiduciary responsibility or prohibited transaction provisions of Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, but
may nevertheless be subject to Similar Laws. Fiduciaries of any such Plans should consult with their legal advisors
regarding the potential consequences of an investment in the notes under any applicable Similar Laws before
purchasing or holding any notes.

Because of the foregoing, the notes should not be purchased or held by any person investing the assets of
any Plan, unless such purchase and holding will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under
ERISA and the Code or a similar violation of any applicable Similar Laws.

**Representation**

Accordingly, by acceptance of a note (or any interest therein), each purchaser and subsequent transferee
will be deemed to have represented and warranted that either (i) no portion of the assets used by such purchaser or
transferee to purchase or hold the notes (or any interest therein) constitutes assets of any Plan or (ii) the purchase,
holding and subsequent disposition of the notes (or any interest therein) will not constitute or result in a non-exempt
prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a similar violation under any
applicable Similar Laws.

The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all-inclusive. Due to the complexity
of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it
is particularly important that fiduciaries or other persons considering purchasing or holding the notes (or any interest
therein) on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their legal advisors regarding the potential
applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws to such investment and whether an
exemption would be applicable to the purchase and holding of the notes (and any interest therein). Each purchaser
and subsequent transferee has exclusive responsibility for ensuring that its purchase and holding of the notes (and
any interest therein) does not violate the fiduciary responsibility or prohibited transaction rules of ERISA or the
Code, or the provisions of any applicable Similar Laws. Neither this discussion nor anything provided in this
offering memorandum is, or is intended to be, investment advice directed at any potential Plan purchasers, or at Plan
purchasers generally, or that such an investment meets all relevant legal requirements with respect to investments by
Plans generally or any particular Plan, or that such investment is prudent or appropriate for Plans generally or any
particular Plan. Purchasers of any notes should consult and rely on their own counsel and advisors as to whether
such an investment is suitable for the Plan.

The purchase agreement provides that the initial purchasers’ obligation to purchase the notes depends on
the satisfaction of the certain conditions contained in the purchase agreement. The initial purchasers have agreed to
purchase all of the notes if they purchase any such notes. If an initial purchaser defaults, the purchase agreement
provides that the purchase commitments of the non-defaulting initial purchasers may be increased or the purchase
agreement may be terminated.

The initial purchasers will purchase the notes at a customary discount from the offering price indicated on
the cover of this offering memorandum and propose initially to offer and sell the notes at the offering price set forth
on the front of this offering memorandum. If all the notes are not sold at the initial offering price following the
initial offering, the initial purchasers may change the initial offering price and other selling terms.

**Lock-Up**

We and the guarantors have agreed not to, directly or indirectly, sell, offer, contract or grant any option to
sell, pledge, transfer or establish an open “put equivalent position,” or otherwise dispose of or transfer, or announce
an offer of, or file any registration statement in respect of, any of our debt securities or securities exchangeable for
or convertible into our debt securities for a period of 45 days after the date of this offering memorandum, in each
case, without the prior written consent of Barclays Capital Inc., on behalf of the initial purchasers.

**Indemnification**

We have agreed to indemnify the initial purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the
Securities Act, or to contribute to payments that the initial purchasers may be required to make for these liabilities.

**Stabilization and Short Positions**

In connection with this offering, the initial purchasers may engage in certain transactions that stabilize,
maintain or otherwise affect the price of the notes. Specifically, the initial purchasers may over-allot in connection
with the offering of the notes, creating a syndicate short position. In addition, the initial purchasers may bid for and
purchase notes in the open market to cover syndicate short positions or to stabilize the price of the notes. Any of
these activities may stabilize or maintain the market price of the notes above what it would be in the absence of such
activities. The initial purchasers are not required to engage in any of these activities, and they may end any of them
at any time. We and the initial purchasers make no representation as to the direction or magnitude of any effect that
the transactions described above may have on the price of the notes. In addition, neither we nor any of the initial


-----

purchasers make any representation that anyone will engage in such transactions or that such transactions, once
commenced, will not be discontinued without notice.

**Settlement**

It is expected that delivery of the notes will be made against payment therefor on or about the date specified
on the cover of this offering memorandum, which is the      business day following the date of pricing of the
notes (such settlement cycle being referred to as “T+      ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in one
business day unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to
trade the notes prior to the date that is one business day preceding the settlement date will be required, by virtue of
the fact that the notes initially will settle in T+      to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any
such trade to prevent failed settlement. Purchasers of the notes who wish to trade the notes during such period
should consult their own advisor.

**Other Relationships**

The initial purchasers and certain of their affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various
activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment
management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. The initial
purchasers and certain of their affiliates have, from time to time, performed, and may in the future perform, various
commercial and investment banking and financial advisory services for the us and our affiliates, for which they
received or may in the future receive customary fees and expenses. In particular, Barclays Capital Inc. and/or its
affiliates is acting as lead financial advisor, and RBC Capital Markets, LLC and/or its affiliates is acting as financial
advisor, to Copeland and Blackstone and their affiliates in connection with the Seller Notes Repurchase and the Unit
Purchase Transaction, for which Barclays Capital Inc. and/or its affiliates will receive customary fees. Goldman
Sachs & Co. LLC and/or its affiliates is acting as exclusive financial advisor to Emerson in connection with the
Seller Notes Repurchase and the Unit Purchase Transaction, for which they may receive customary fees. Certain of
the initial purchasers and/or their affiliates have provided committed financing to the Sponsors or their affiliates in
connection with the Acquisition. U.S. Bancorp Investments, Inc., one of the initial purchasers, is an affiliate of the
Trustee, Notes Collateral Agent, Registrar, Paying Agent, Transfer Agent, and Escrow Agent under the indenture
and will receive customary fees in connection therewith. In addition, certain of the initial purchasers and/or their
affiliates are arrangers, agents and/or lenders under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and will receive customary
compensation in connection therewith. In particular, Royal Bank of Canada, an affiliate of one of the initial
purchasers, is the administrative agent, collateral agent, swing line lender and L/C issuer under our Term Loan
Facilities. Blackstone Securities Partners L.P., an affiliate of one of the Sponsors, is an initial purchaser of the notes.
See “Use of Proceeds.”

In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the initial purchasers and certain of their affiliates
may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative
securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their
customers, and such investment and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of ours or our
affiliates. If the initial purchasers or their affiliates have a lending relationship with us, certain of those initial
purchasers or their affiliates routinely hedge, and certain other of those initial purchasers or their affiliates may
hedge, their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, the initial
purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the
purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities or the securities of our affiliates,
including potentially the notes. Any such credit default swaps or short positions could adversely affect future trading
prices of the notes. The initial purchasers and certain of their affiliates may also communicate independent
investment recommendations, market color or trading ideas and/or publish or express independent research views in
respect of such securities or instruments and may at any time hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long
and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.

**Rule 144A and Regulation S**

The notes have not been registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws, and unless so
registered, may not be offered or sold within the U.S., or to or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons (as defined
in Regulation S under the Securities Act) except pursuant to an exemption from or in a transaction not subject to, the
registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. See “Notice to Investors.” The
notes have no established trading market and will not be listed on any national securities exchange. The initial
purchasers have advised us of their intention to make a market for the notes, but have no obligation to do so and may
discontinue market-making at any time without providing any notice. We cannot assure you as to the liquidity of any
trading market for the notes.

We have been advised by the initial purchasers that the initial purchasers propose to resell these notes to
(a) persons they reasonably believe to be qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities
Act and (b) outside the U.S. to certain non-U.S. persons in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act. See
“Notice to Investors”. Any offer or sale of the notes in reliance on Rule 144A will be made by broker-dealers who
are registered as such under the Exchange Act.

Each of the initial purchasers has acknowledged and agreed that, except as permitted by the purchase
agreement, in connection with sales outside the United States, it will not offer, sell or deliver the notes to, or for the
account or benefit of U.S. persons (a) as part of their distribution at any time or (b) otherwise until 40 days after the
later of the commencement of the offering or the date the notes were originally issued. The initial purchasers will
send to each dealer to whom they sell the notes in reliance on Regulation S during the 40-day distribution
compliance period, a confirmation or other notice setting forth the restrictions on offers and sales of the notes within
the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons. Terms used in this paragraph have the
meanings assigned to them in Regulation S under the Securities Act.

In addition, until the expiration of the 40-day distribution compliance period referred to above, an offer or
sale of the notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in this offering) may violate the
registration requirements of the Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than in accordance with Rule
144A under the Securities Act or pursuant to another exemption from registration under the Securities Act.

**New Issue of Notes**

The notes are new issues of securities with no established trading market. We do not intend to apply for listing of the
notes on any U.S. securities exchange or for inclusion of such notes on any automated quotation system. We have
been advised by certain of the initial purchasers that they presently intend to make a market in the notes after
completion of the offering. However, they are under no obligation to do so and may discontinue any market making
activities at any time without any notice. We cannot assure the liquidity of the trading market for the notes. If an
active trading market for the notes does not develop, the market price and liquidity of the notes may be adversely
affected. If the notes are traded, they may trade at a discount from their initial offering price, depending on
prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities, our operating performance and financial condition, general
economic conditions and other factors. In addition, the ability of the initial purchasers to make a market in the notes
may be impacted by changes in regulatory requirements applicable to the marketing, holding and trading of, and
issuing quotations with respect to, the notes.

**Selling Restrictions**

**_European Economic Area_**

The notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered,
sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in a member state of the European Economic Area (the
“EEA”). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in
point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of
Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as amended, the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not
qualify as a “professional client” as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a “qualified


-----

investor” as defined in Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended, the “Prospectus Regulation”). Consequently, no
key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for
offering or selling the notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared
and, therefore, offering or selling the notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA
may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of notes in any member state of
the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a
prospectus for offers of notes. This offering memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus
Regulation.

The above selling restriction is in addition to any other selling restrictions set out below.

**_United Kingdom_**

The notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered,
sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom (the “U.K.”) For these purposes, a
“retail investor” means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of
Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (the
“EUWA”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the European Financial Services and Markets Act
2000 (as amended, the “FSMA”) and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement the Insurance
Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of
Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (iii) not a
qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of
the EUWA (the “U.K. Prospectus Regulation”). Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation
(EU) No 1286/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “U.K. PRIIPs Regulation”) for
offering or selling the notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the U.K. has been prepared
and, therefore, offering or selling the notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the U.K.
may be unlawful under the U.K. PRIIPs Regulation.

This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the notes in the U.K. will be
made pursuant to an exemption under section 86 of the FSMA from the requirement to publish a prospectus for
offers of notes. The offering memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the U.K. Prospectus Regulation.

This offering memorandum has not been approved by an authorized person in the U.K. This offering
memorandum is for distribution only to persons who: (i) have professional experience in matters relating to
investments falling within Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion)
Order 2005, as amended (the “Financial Promotion Order”); (ii) are persons falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d)

the meaning of section 21 of the FSMA) in connection with the issue or sale of any securities may otherwise
lawfully be communicated or caused to be communicated (all such persons together being referred to as “relevant
persons”). This offering memorandum is directed only at relevant persons and must not be acted on or relied on by
persons who are not relevant persons. Any investment or investment activity to which this offering memorandum
relates is available only to relevant persons and will be engaged in only with relevant persons.

**_Canada_**

The notes may be sold in Canada only to purchasers purchasing, or deemed to be purchasing, as principal
that are accredited investors, as defined in National Instrument 45-106 Prospectus Exemptions or subsection 73.3(1)
of the Securities Act (Ontario), and are permitted clients, as defined in National Instrument 31-103 Registration
Requirements, Exemptions and Ongoing Registrant Obligations. Any resale of the notes must be made in
accordance with an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the prospectus requirements of applicable
securities laws.


-----

for rescission or damages if this offering memorandum (including any amendment thereto) contains a
misrepresentation, provided that the remedies for rescission or damages are exercised by the purchaser within the

to any applicable provisions of the securities legislation of the purchaser’s province or territory for particulars of
these rights or consult with a legal advisor.

of interest in connection with this offering.

(Cap. 32) of Hong Kong) (the “C(WUMP)O”) or which do not constitute an offer or invitation to the public within

**Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm**

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors
Emerald JV Holdings L.P.:

_Opinion on the Consolidated and Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements_

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Emerald JV Holdings L.P. and subsidiaries
(the Company) as of September 30, 2023 (Successor) and the related consolidated statements of operations,
comprehensive (loss) income, equity, and cash flows for the four months ended September 30, 2023
(Successor period) and the consolidated and combined balance sheet as of September 30, 2022 (Predecessor)
and the related consolidated and combined statements of operations, comprehensive (loss) income, equity,
and cash flows for the eight months ended May 31, 2023 and the year ended September 30, 2022
(Predecessor periods) and the related notes to the consolidated and consolidated and combined financial
statements (collectively, the consolidated and consolidated and combined financial statements). In our opinion,
the consolidated and consolidated and combined financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2023 (Successor) and September 30, 2022
(Predecessor), and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the Successor and Predecessor periods,
in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

_New Basis of Accounting_

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated and consolidated and combined financial statements, effective
May 31, 2023, the Company was acquired in a business combination. As a result of the acquisition, the
financial information for the period after the acquisition is presented on a different cost basis than that for the
periods before the acquisition and, therefore, is not comparable.

_Basis for Opinion_

These consolidated and consolidated and combined financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated and consolidated
and combined financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the
PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB and in accordance with auditing
standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated and consolidated and
combined financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits
included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated and
consolidated and combined financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that
respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts
and disclosures in the consolidated and consolidated and combined financial statements. Our audits also
included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated and consolidated and combined financial statements.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

_Critical Audit Matters_

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the
consolidated and consolidated and combined financial statements that were communicated or required to be
communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the
consolidated and consolidated and combined financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,
subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our
opinion on the consolidated and consolidated and combined financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are
not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters
or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

_Sufficiency of audit evidence over net sales_

As discussed in Notes 1 and 3 to the Company’s consolidated and consolidated and combined financial
statements, and disclosed in the consolidated and consolidated and combined statements of operations,
the Company recorded $1,676.9 million of net sales for the four months ended September 30, 2023
(Successor) and $3,162.3 million for the eight months ended May 31, 2023 (Predecessor).

We identified the evaluation of the sufficiency of audit evidence over net sales as a critical audit matter. Net
sales are recognized primarily from the sale of manufactured products at locations in multiple countries
around the world. Evaluating the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained required subjective auditor
judgment because of the geographical dispersion of the Company’s net sales generating activities. This
included determining the locations at which procedures were performed and evaluating the evidence
obtained over net sales.

The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We applied
auditor judgment to determine the nature and extent of procedures to be performed over net sales,
including the determination of the Company locations at which those procedures were to be performed. For
one financially significant location, we performed a software-assisted data analysis to test the relationships
among certain revenue transactions. For other locations for which procedures were performed, we
assessed the recorded net sales by selecting a sample of transactions and compared the amounts
recognized for consistency with underlying documentation, including contracts with customers and other
third-party evidence. We evaluated the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained by assessing the results of
procedures performed, including the appropriateness of the nature and extent of such evidence.

_Valuation of customer relationships acquired in the business combination._

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated and consolidated and combined financial statements, on
October 30, 2022, the Company entered into a Transaction Agreement with Emerson, BCP Emerald
Aggregator L.P. (BCP) and Emerald Debt Merger Sub L.L.C. whereby BCP agreed to purchase, and
Emerson agreed to sell, equity interests in JV NewCo following the Restructuring for a purchase price of
$13,647.1 million. The acquisition was consummated on May 31, 2023. As of the date of the transaction,
the Company recognized customer relationships intangible assets acquired with a provisional estimated fair
value of $4,250.0 million, which includes customer relationships related to the HVACR Technologies
business unit. The Company determined the fair value of the customer relationships using the multi-period
excess earnings methodology.

We identified the valuation of the customer relationship intangible asset related to the HVACR
Technologies business unit as a critical audit matter. We performed a sensitivity analysis to determine
which assumptions used by management most significantly impacted the fair value of the customer
relationship intangible asset. A high degree of subjective auditor judgement was required to evaluate
certain assumptions in the valuation of the customer relationship intangible asset, specifically the revenue
growth rates and EBITDA margins. Additionally, evaluating the discount rate and the customer attrition rate
required the involvement of valuation professionals with specialized skills. Changes in these assumptions


-----

could have had a significant impact on the fair value of the HVACR Technologies business unit customer
relationship intangible asset.

The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated
the design of certain internal controls related to the Company’s acquisition date valuation process,
including controls related to the development of the revenue growth rates, EBITDA margins and customer
attrition rate assumptions. We evaluated the revenue growth rates and EBITDA margins by comparing
them to the historical financial results of the acquired business and historical financial results and
projections of certain peer companies. We involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and
knowledge, who assisted in:

- evaluating the discount rate by comparing it to independently developed ranges of the weighted
average cost of capital and the weighted average return on assets, and recomputing the discount rate

- evaluating the customer attrition rate by comparing it to the Company’s historical customer attrition data

- evaluating the customer attrition rate by comparing it to implied customer attrition rates in similar
transactions in the Company’s industry.

_Valuation of developed technology and trade name acquired in the business combination_

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated and consolidated and combined financial statements, on
October 30, 2022, the Company entered into a Transaction Agreement with Emerson, BCP Emerald
Aggregator L.P. (“BCP”) and Emerald Debt Merger Sub L.L.C. whereby BCP agreed to purchase, and
Emerson agreed to sell, equity interests in JV NewCo following the Restructuring for a purchase price of
$13,647.1 million. The acquisition was consummated on May 31, 2023. As of the date of the transaction,
the Company recognized developed technology and trade name intangible assets acquired at provisional
estimated fair values of $1,300.0 million and $880.0 million, respectively, which includes developed
technology and trade name intangible assets related to the HVACR Technologies business unit. The
Company determined the fair value of developed technology and trade name intangible assets using the
relief from royalty methodology.

We identified the valuation of developed technology and trade name intangible assets related to the
HVACR Technologies business unit as a critical audit matter. We performed a sensitivity analysis to
determine which assumptions used by management most significantly impacted the fair value of the
developed technology and trade name intangible assets. A high degree of subjective auditor judgement
was required to evaluate certain assumptions used in the valuation of the developed technology and trade
name intangible assets, specifically the revenue growth rates. Additionally, evaluating the discount rates,
royalty rates, as well as the obsolescence factor as it relates to the valuation of the developed technology
intangible asset, required the involvement of valuation professionals with specialized skills. Changes in
these assumptions could have had a significant impact on the fair value of the HVACR Technologies
business unit developed technology and trade name intangible assets.

The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated
the design of certain internal controls related to the Company’s acquisition date valuation process,
including controls related to the development of the revenue growth rates, royalty rates, and the
obsolescence factor assumptions. We evaluated the revenue growth rates by comparing them to the
historical financial results of the acquired business and historical financial results and projections of certain
peer companies. We involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted
in:

- evaluating the discount rates by comparing them to independently developed ranges of the weighted
average cost of capital and the weighted average return on assets, and recomputing the discount rates


-----

  - evaluating the royalty rates against comparable licensing agreements

  - evaluating the obsolescence factor by comparing it to implied annual obsolescence rates in similar
transactions in the Company’s industry.

We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2022.

#### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Emerald JV Holdings L.P.

(Dollars in millions, except where noted)

#### (1) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Description of Business

Emerald JV Holdings L.P. (“Emerald,” “JV NewCo,” or the “Company”) is a leading provider of compression
technologies, electronics and controls products, as well as components, software and solutions that broadly
serve applications across the Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning and Refrigeration (“HVACR”) and Industrial
industries. The Company's businesses are primarily organized by product offering. The Company's products
are organized into two broad categories - HVACR Technologies and Electronics and Controls (which includes
the Cold Chain and Comfort Control technologies). The served applications include, among others, heating and
cooling including heat pump applications, food service / retail / industrial refrigeration, perishable goods,
transportation, healthcare / life sciences, and renewable energy. The Company’s compression technologies
enable higher efficiency in commercial and residential HVAC units, as well as in commercial and industrial
refrigeration units. The Company also has a solution portfolio that manages, monitors and controls refrigeration
units in the commercial setting, as well as software solutions that measure and monitor temperature conditions
of refrigerated goods in transit. The Company’s industrial products are designed into renewable energy
processes including RNG and Biogas applications. In general, the company’s technologies and solutions
address global trends, including i. the decarbonization and increased energy efficiency of heating, cooling,
refrigeration, and industrial processes, ii. the drive towards lower-GWP refrigerants, and iii. the efficient
transport of perishable goods including food and medicine. The Company now operates under the Copeland
brand, as well as the Sensi, Verdant, Vilter and White-Rodgers sub-brands.

Emerald JV Holdings L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, was formed by Emerson Electric Co. (“Emerson”),
to hold its Climate Technologies Business (“Climate Technologies”) in connection with the acquisition of a
majority stake in Climate Technologies (the “Acquisition”) by certain investment funds affiliated with Blackstone
Inc. (“Blackstone”). The Company currently holds Climate Technologies, after the completion of certain
restructuring steps undertaken by Emerson to transfer Climate Technologies to JV NewCo (the “Restructuring”).
As Emerald JV Holdings L.P. did not have any previous operations, Climate Technologies is viewed as the
predecessor to the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries. Accordingly, these consolidated financial
statements include certain historical consolidated financial and other data for Climate Technologies for periods
prior to the completion of the Acquisition.

Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation

As a result of the Acquisition as further discussed in Note 2, periods prior to May 31, 2023 reflect the financial
statements of Climate Technologies prior to the Acquisition (referred to herein as the “Predecessor” period).
Periods subsequent to May 31, 2023 reflect the financial statements of the Company after the Acquisition
(referred to herein as the “Successor” period). The Company’s assets and liabilities were adjusted to fair value
on the closing date of the Acquisition. Due to the change in the basis of accounting, the consolidated and
combined financial statements for the Predecessor and the consolidated financial statements for the Successor
are not comparable. Where applicable, a “black line” separates the Successor and Predecessor periods to
highlight the lack of comparability.

The Successor Statement of Operations reflects the results of the business following the closing of the
Acquisition. However, on May 19, 2023, Emerald Debt Merger Sub L.L.C (“Merger Sub”), a subsidiary of
Emerald JV Holdings, L.P., and which was merged with and into EMRLD Borrower LP (“EMRLD Borrower”) on
the Acquisition Date (as defined below), and Emerald Co-Issuer Inc., a direct subsidiary of Merger Sub, issued
senior secured notes in the aggregate principal amount of $2,275.0 and aggregate principal amount of €455.0
(or $500.0 U.S. dollar equivalent, based on the exchange rate of approximately $1.10 per €1.00), the “Dollar
Notes” and “Euro Notes”, respectively and collectively the “Notes”. The Company incurred $6.2 of interest


-----

expense for the period from May 19, 2023 to May 31, 2023 related to the Notes (see Note 12 for further details),
which has been recognized in the Successor period.

This report includes historical consolidated financial statements and certain financial data of the Company in
lieu of consolidated financial statements and financial data for EMRLD Borrower, the borrower under the Senior
Secured Credit Facilities and the issuer of the Notes and the direct subsidiary of EMRLD Guarantor LP
(“Holdings”). The Company does not have any material operating, investing, or financing activities other than
being (i) the issuer of the Preferred Equity and (ii) a holding company for EMRLD Seller Notes Issuer LP (the
“Emerson Notes Issuer”) and Holdings and its subsidiaries. Accordingly, with the exception of the Preferred
Equity issued by the Company (see Note 15 for further details), and the Emerson Notes issued by the Emerson
Notes Issuer (see Note 12 for further details), the consolidated Balance Sheet and results of operations of
Holdings and its subsidiaries, including EMRLD Borrower, would be substantially identical to those of the
Company and its subsidiaries for the periods for which financial information is presented in this report.

Prior to the consummation of the Acquisition, Climate Technologies had historically operated as part of Emerson
and not as a standalone entity. The consolidated and combined financial statements for the Predecessor period
present the historical financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of the Company as if it had
operated on a standalone basis subject to Emerson’s control and include all accounts of the Company and its
subsidiaries and affiliates on a consolidated basis. Intercompany transactions, profits and balances among
Climate Technologies entities have been eliminated in consolidation. The Predecessor period consolidated and
combined financial statements were derived from Emerson’s financial statements and accounting records and
have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
(U.S. GAAP). Sale and purchase transactions between the Company and other Emerson affiliates are included
in the consolidated financial statements. See Note 16 for further details.

As a business of Emerson, during the Predecessor period, Climate Technologies was charged for costs directly
related to the Company and has been allocated a portion of Emerson’s general corporate costs. These costs
are reflected in the consolidated and combined financial statements. The Company participated in various
Emerson programs which include information technology services, employee benefits, medical insurance, and
other programs. Costs associated with these programs were charged to the Company based on Emerson’s
actual cost and the Company’s relative level of usage. The Company also utilized Emerson’s global shared
service centers and was charged for direct costs and its share of facilities overhead.

Emerson provided certain oversight and support services, including assistance with management strategy,
logistics, marketing, finance, treasury, tax, human resources, legal and other activities. Emerson also charged
royalties for use of Emerson’s trademarks and trade names and supply chain services. A charge for these
services and royalties was allocated to the Company based principally on revenue. While management believes
the methodologies and assumptions used to allocate these costs were reasonable, the consolidated and
combined financial statements for the Predecessor period do not purport to represent the financial position, or
the results of operations, changes in equity, and cash flows of the Company for the Successor period or in the
future, or what they would have been had the Company operated as a standalone entity during the Predecessor
periods presented.

The Company has applied the same accounting policies between Predecessor and Successor periods. Certain
information has been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and
expenses for the periods presented. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Foreign Currency

The consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, which is the Company's reporting currency.
The functional currency for the Company's operations in Mexico, Argentina, Thailand, Hong Kong, Denmark,
and the majority in the Middle East is U.S. dollars while most other non-U.S. operations use the local currency.


-----

Adjustments resulting from translating local currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are reflected in
accumulated other comprehensive income. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional
currencies are subject to changes in exchange rates with resulting gains/losses recorded in net earnings.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Our short-term investments are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient,
and therefore, are not classified in the fair value hierarchy. Our cash held in banks is measured in the fair value
hierarchy using Level 1 inputs.

Receivables and Allowance for Credit Losses

Receivables are shown net of allowance for credit losses. The Company monitors customer-specific payment
and write-off history as well as forward-looking trends and macro-economic factors to estimate an allowance
for credit losses.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value and are valued based on standard costs which
approximate average costs. Cost standards are revised at the beginning of each fiscal year. The annual effect
of resetting standards plus operating variances incurred during each period are allocated between inventories
and recognized in cost of sales as products are sold.

Property, Plant and Equipment

The Company records investments in land, buildings, and machinery and equipment at cost. Depreciation is
computed principally using the straight-line method over estimated service lives, which for principal assets are
30 to 40 years for buildings and 10 to 12 years for machinery and equipment. Long-lived tangible assets are
reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate the carrying value of
the assets may not be recoverable. Impairment losses, if any, are recognized based on estimated fair values if
the sum of expected future undiscounted cash flows of the related assets is less than the carrying values.

Costs of software developed for internal use are accounted for in accordance with Accounting Standards
Codification (“ASC”) Subtopic 350-40, Internal-Use Software. Capitalized internal use software and the related
accumulated amortization have been classified on the consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2023
(Successor) and the consolidated and combined Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2022 (Predecessor) have
been reclassified from Other intangible assets to Property, plant and equipment, net to more closely align these
net assets with the category of the assets they represent.

Goodwill and Other Intangibles

Assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method and
recorded at their respective fair values. Goodwill represents the excess of consideration paid over total fair
value of the net assets acquired. The Company conducts its annual impairment test of goodwill, typically in the
fourth quarter, and between tests if events or circumstances indicate a reporting unit's fair value may be less
than its carrying value. If an initial assessment indicates it is more likely than not goodwill might be impaired, it
is evaluated by comparing the reporting unit's estimated fair value to its carrying value. An impairment charge
would be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair
value. Estimated fair values are developed primarily under an income approach that discounts estimated future
cash flows using risk adjusted interest rates, as well as market approaches such as earnings multiples or other
techniques as warranted. Fair values are subject to changes in underlying economic conditions.

All of the Company's identifiable intangible assets are subject to amortization on a straight-line basis over their
estimated useful lives. Identifiable intangible assets consist of intellectual property, customer relationships,


-----

developed technology, trade name, and backlog and are also subject to evaluation for potential impairment if
events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.

No goodwill or intangible asset impairment was recorded for any of the periods presented.

Leases

As the lessee

The Company leases offices, manufacturing facilities and equipment, and transportation, information
technology, and office equipment primarily under operating lease arrangements. The Company determines
whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease at contract inception. An arrangement contains a lease if the
Company has the right to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the economic benefits of an identified
asset. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at lease commencement based on the present
value of lease payments over the lease term. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recognized
on the Balance Sheet and are recorded as short-term lease expenses. The discount rate used to calculate
present value is the Company's incremental borrowing rate based on the lease term and the economic
environment of the applicable country or region.

Certain leases have renewal options or options to terminate prior to lease expiration, which are included in the
measurement of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities when it is reasonably certain they will be exercised.
The Company has elected to account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for its
offices and manufacturing facilities. Some lease arrangements include payments that are adjusted periodically
based on actual charges incurred for common area maintenance, utilities, taxes and insurance, or changes in
an index or rate referenced in the lease. The fixed portion of these payments is included in the measurement
of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities at lease commencement, while the variable portion is recorded as
variable lease expense. The Company's leases do not contain material residual value guarantees or restrictive
covenants.

As the lessor

The Company is a lessor in arrangements to lease certain properties. As a lessor, the Company’s leases are
classified as operating leases under ASC 842 and accounted for as operating leases. The underlying asset in
an operating lease is carried at depreciated cost and is included in Property, plant and equipment, net. The
company has elected to account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. Variable
lease payments, if any, are recognized as income in the period received. Rental income from operating leases
is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. Initial direct costs incurred in
negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and
recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Lease income is recognized as an offset to selling,
general and administrative expenses, within the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the Successor
period.

Noncontrolling Interests in a Subsidiary

The Company holds a 51% controlling financial interest in Alliance Compressors LLC ("Alliance") and therefore,
the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of Alliance have been included in the Company's
consolidated financial statements. The remaining 49% interest in Alliance are accounted for as noncontrolling
interests in subsidiary in the Company's consolidated financial statements.

Net Parent Investment

The net parent investment balance included in the consolidated and combined Predecessor Balance Sheet
represents Emerson’s historical investment in the Company, the Company’s accumulated net earnings after
income taxes, and the net effect of the transactions with Emerson.


-----

Revenue Recognition

In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers,
the Company evaluates its contracts with customers to identify the promised goods or services and recognize
revenue for the identified performance obligations at the amount the Company expects to be entitled to in
exchange for those goods or services. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct
good or service to a customer. Revenue is recognized when, or as performance obligations are satisfied, and
control has transferred to the customer, typically when products are shipped or delivered, title and risk of loss
pass to the customer, and the Company has a present right to payment.

The vast majority of the Company's revenues are performance obligations related to the sale of manufactured
products which are recognized at a point in time when control transfers in accordance with shipping terms. In
limited circumstances, contracts include multiple performance obligations, where revenue is recognized
separately for each good or service, as well as contracts where revenue is recognized over time as control
transfers to the customer.

For revenues recognized over time, the Company typically uses an input method to determine progress and
recognize revenue, based on costs incurred. The Company believes costs incurred closely correspond with its
performance under the contract and the transfer of control to the customer.

In sales arrangements that involve multiple performance obligations, revenue is allocated based on the relative
standalone selling price for each performance obligation. Observable selling prices from actual transactions are
used whenever possible. In other instances, the Company determines the standalone selling price based on
third-party pricing or management's best estimate.

Payment terms vary but are generally short-term in nature. The Company's long-term contracts, where revenue
is generally recognized over time, are billed as work progresses in accordance with the contract terms and
conditions, either at periodic intervals or upon achievement of certain milestones. The timing of revenue
recognition and billings under these contracts results in either unbilled receivables (contract assets) when
revenue recognized exceeds billings, or customer advances (contract liabilities) when billings exceed revenue
recognized. Unbilled receivables are reclassified to accounts receivable when an unconditional right to
consideration exists, typically when a milestone in the contract is achieved. The Company does not evaluate
whether the transaction price includes a significant financing component for contracts where the time between
cash collection and performance is less than one year.

Certain arrangements with customers include variable consideration, typically in the form of rebates, cash
discounts or penalties. Other than standard product warranty provisions, sales arrangements provide no other
post shipment obligations on the Company. In most instances, returns are limited to product quality issues. The
Company records a reduction to revenue at the time of sale to reflect the ultimate amount of consideration it
expects to receive. The Company's estimates are updated quarterly based on historical experience, trend
analysis, and expected market conditions. Variable consideration is typically not constrained at the time revenue
is recognized.

The Company records amounts billed to customers for the costs of shipping and handling in sales transactions
as revenue and such costs are not considered separate performance obligations. Shipping and handling costs
incurred by the Company to deliver products to customers were $9.9, $20.6, and $35.5 for the four months
ended September 30, 2023 (Successor), eight months ended May 31, 2023 (Predecessor) and year ended
September 30, 2022 (Predecessor), respectively, and were reported in selling, general and administrative
expenses.

Interest (Expense) Income, Net

Interest income and expense are recognized in the consolidated Statement of Operations line Interest
(expense) income, net, when earned or incurred, on an accrual basis using the effective interest rate method.
The effective interest rate method is an approach to calculating the amortized cost of a financial asset or
financial liability using the effective interest rate. The effective interest rate is used to discount estimated future
cash payments or receipts as of the maturity date to the present value. Interest expense consists of interest


-----

incurred on debt issued in the Successor period (see Note 12 for further details). In the Predecessor period,
interest income consisted of interest earned on a note receivable Climate Technologies made to a subsidiary
of Emerson (see Note 16 for further details). In the Successor period, the Company earned $1.1 of interest
income on deposits.

Warranty

Warranties largely provide assurance that the product will function as intended and generally extend for a period
of one to two years from the date of sale. Warranties vary by product line and are competitive for the markets
in which the Company operates. Provisions for warranty expense are estimated at the time of sale based on
historical experience and adjusted quarterly for any known issues that may arise.

The changes in product warranty liabilities are as follows:

Successor
Total warranty liability as of June 1, 2023 $ 40.5
Payments made (9.8)
Changes resulting from issuance of new warranties 11.7
Changes in estimates associated with pre-existing liabilities (0.1)
Changes in foreign currency translation rates and other (0.2)
Total warranty liability as of September 30, 2023 $ 42.1

Predecessor
Total warranty liability as of October 1, 2021 $ 35.1
Payments made (23.4)
Changes resulting from issuance of new warranties 31.0
Changes in estimates associated with pre-existing liabilities (1.4)
Changes in foreign currency translation rates and other (1.1)
Total warranty liability as of September 30, 2022 $ 40.2
Payments made (16.1)
Changes resulting from issuance of new warranties 18.4
Changes in estimates associated with pre-existing liabilities (2.6)
Changes in foreign currency translation rates and other 0.6
Total warranty liability as of May 31, 2023 $ 40.5

Supplier Finance Program

In the Successor period, the Company facilitates a voluntary supplier finance program (the "Program") to
provide certain suppliers with the opportunity to sell receivables due from the Company to the participating
financial institution in the Program. Such sales are conducted at the sole discretion of both the suppliers and
the financial institution on a non-recourse basis at a rate that leverages the Company's credit rating and thus
might be more beneficial to the supplier. The Company's responsibility is limited to making payment on the
terms originally negotiated with its suppliers, regardless of whether the suppliers sell their receivables to the
financial institution. The amount owed to the participating financial institution under the Program and included
in accounts payable was $92.3 at September 30, 2023. In the Predecessor period, Emerson facilitated a similar
program with a balance of $170.8 at September 30, 2022.

Fair Value Measurement

ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement, establishes a formal hierarchy and framework for measuring certain
financial statement items at fair value, and requires disclosures about fair value measurements and the reliability
of valuation inputs. Under ASC 820, measurement assumes the transaction to sell an asset or transfer a liability
occurs in the principal or at least the most advantageous market for that asset or liability. Within the hierarchy,
Level 1 instruments use observable market prices for the identical item in active markets and have the most


-----

reliable valuations. Level 2 instruments are valued through broker/dealer quotation or through marketobservable inputs for similar items in active markets, including forward and spot prices, interest rates and
volatilities. Level 3 instruments are valued using inputs not observable in an active market, such as companydeveloped future cash flows, and are considered the least reliable. Valuations for all the Company's financial
instruments, identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the Acquisition, Emerson Notes, and
Preferred Equity Class P Units fall within Level 2. Carrying value approximates fair value for cash and cash
equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and
commodity prices. The Company's foreign currency exposures relate to transactions denominated in currencies
that differ from the functional currencies of its subsidiaries, principally Mexican pesos. Foreign exchange
forwards are utilized, as needed, to hedge foreign currency exposures impacting earnings, firm commitments,
or the fair value of assets and liabilities. Commodity exposures are price fluctuations on forecasted purchases
of copper and aluminum. All derivatives are associated with specific underlying exposures and the Company
does not hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. The initial duration of hedge positions is generally
less than two years.

All derivatives are accounted for under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and recognized at fair value.
For derivatives hedging variability in future cash flows, any gain or loss is deferred in equity and recognized
when the underlying hedged transaction impacts earnings. The Company's foreign currency derivatives and
most commodity derivatives qualify for hedge accounting. Gains or losses on derivative instruments that do not
receive hedge accounting treatment under ASC 815 are recognized in the income statement immediately.

Income Taxes

Prior to the Acquisition (Predecessor period), the Company's operations were historically included in Emerson's
combined U.S. and non-U.S. income tax returns in most locations. Effective on the date of the Acquisition
(Successor period), substantially all U.S. operations are effectively owned by an entity treated as a partnership
for U.S. tax purposes, which is not subject to U.S. income tax.

Income tax expense included in the financial statements has been calculated following the separate return
method, which applies ASC 740, Income Taxes, as if the Company was a stand-alone enterprise and a separate
taxpayer for the periods presented. The calculation of income taxes on a separate return basis requires
considerable judgment and the use of both estimates and allocations that affect the calculation of certain tax
liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary
differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expenses. As a result, the
Company's deferred income tax rate and deferred tax balances may differ from those in Emerson's historical
results.

The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of ASC 740. Under this
approach, deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. Deferred taxes result from differences between the financial
statement and tax basis of the Company's assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted rates in effect
for the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances
are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized.
The tax carryforwards reflected in the Company's consolidated and combined financial statements have been
determined using the separate return method.

The complexity of tax regulations requires assessments of uncertainties in estimating taxes the Company will
ultimately pay. The Company recognizes liabilities for anticipated tax audit uncertainties in the U.S. and other
tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether, and the extent to which additional taxes would be due on a
separate return basis. Tax liabilities are presented net of any related tax loss carryforwards.

The Company also provides for income taxes, net of any potentially available foreign tax credits, on earnings
intended to be repatriated from foreign subsidiaries. The undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of


-----

September 30, 2023 are considered permanently invested or otherwise indefinitely retained for continuing
international operations. Recognition of income taxes on undistributed foreign earnings, if any, would be
triggered by a decision to repatriate earnings. Determination of the amount of taxes that might be paid on any
undistributed earnings if eventually remitted is not practicable.

Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

Effective October 1, 2021, the Company adopted three accounting standard updates which had an immaterial
or no impact on the Company’s financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2022. These included:

  - Updates to ASC 805, Business Combinations, which clarify the accounting for contract assets and
liabilities assumed in a business combination. In general, this will result in contract liabilities being
recognized at their historical amounts under ASC 606, rather than at fair value in accordance with the
general requirements of ASC 805.

  - Updates to ASC 740, Income Taxes, which require the recognition of a franchise tax that is partially
based on income as an income-based tax with any incremental amount as a non-income-based tax.
These updates also make certain changes to intra-period tax allocation principles and interim tax
calculations.

  - Updates to ASC 321, Equity Securities, ASC 323, Investments – Equity Method and Joint Ventures,
and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, which clarify how to account for the transition into and out of
the equity method of accounting when evaluating observable transactions.

#### (2) BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

On October 30, 2022, the Company entered into a Transaction Agreement (“Transaction Agreement”) with
Emerson, BCP Emerald Aggregator L.P. (“BCP”) and Merger Sub whereby BCP agreed to purchase, and
Emerson agreed to sell, equity interests in JV NewCo following the Restructuring, for a purchase price of
$13,647.1, as detailed below. The Acquisition was consummated on May 31, 2023 (the “Acquisition Date”).

The Acquisition is accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting which requires, among other things,
that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their estimated fair values (based on Level 3
measurements) as of the Acquisition Date. Additional information existing as of the Acquisition Date, but
unknown to us, may become known during the remainder of the measurement period, not to exceed 12 months
from the Acquisition Date, which may result in changes to the purchase price allocation.

The following tables summarize the purchase consideration and the provisional purchase price allocation to
estimated fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The preliminary calculation of
the total consideration and allocation of the purchase price to the fair value of the Company’s assets acquired
and liabilities assumed has not been completed. The detailed valuations necessary to estimate the fair value of
the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and, accordingly, the adjustments to record the assets acquired
and liabilities assumed at fair value reflects the best estimates based on the information currently available and
are subject to change once additional analyses are completed.

Debt proceeds paid to sellers, net of fees $ 5,167.1
Issued ownership interest in the Company (Preferred) 2,981.0
Issued ownership interest in the Company (Common) 3,396.7
Issuance of debt to an affiliate of the Emerson (“Emerson Notes”) 2,052.3
Cash paid for seller’s transactions expenses 50.0
Total purchase consideration $ 13,647.1


-----

Provisional purchase price allocation $ 13,647.1
Non-controlling interest in subsidiary 216.0
Total to allocate 13,863.1
Less: fair value of net assets acquired and liabilities assumed
Cash and equivalents 118.3
Receivables, net of allowance for credit losses 800.1
Note receivable from related party 947.3
Inventories 600.7
Other current assets 75.5
Property, plant and equipment, net 1,828.1
Other intangible assets 6,582.0
Deferred tax assets 17.8
Other long-term assets 150.1
Accounts payable (709.5)
Note payable to related party (947.3)
Accrued expenses (520.9)
Income taxes payable (38.1)
Deferred tax liabilities (652.4)
Other long-term liabilities (204.8)
Net assets acquired 8,046.9
Goodwill $ 5,816.2

Goodwill is primarily attributable to assembled workforce, expected synergies, and other factors. Goodwill is
generally not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.

The fair values of the identifiable intangible assets acquired at the Acquisition Date are as follows:

Acquisition Date Weighted-Average Useful

Fair Value Life (Years)

Customer relationships $ 4,250.0 12.88
Developed technology 1,300.0 7.85
Trade name 880.0 12.03
Backlog 152.0 0.25
Total identifiable intangible assets acquired $ 6,582.0

The fair values of our trade name and developed technology were determined using relief from royalty
methodology. The fair values of our customer relationships and backlog were determined using multi-period
excess earnings methodology. The valuations of intangible assets incorporate significant unobservable inputs
and require significant judgment and estimates, including the amount and timing of future cash flows.

Customer relationships, developed technology, trade name and backlog are amortized over the respective
useful lives and the expense is recorded in the amortization of intangibles financial statement line item within
the consolidated Statement of Operations.

The Company recognized $147.8 of transaction expenses related to the Acquisition, including $50.0 related to
due-diligence costs, legal fees, and advisor charges; $52.0 related to a breakage fee from alternative standby
debt financing; $25.2 related to buyer stand-up costs, and $20.5 related to the rights and warranty insurance
policy. These costs are recorded in the Transaction and separation-related expenses in the consolidated
statements of operations.

#### (3) REVENUE RECOGNITION

The following table summarizes the balances of the Company’s unbilled receivables (contract assets), which
are reported in other current assets, and its customer advances (contract liabilities), which are reported in
accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities.

Successor Predecessor
Sep 30, 2023 Sep 30, 2022
Unbilled receivables (contract assets) $ 10.9 8.9
Customer advances (contract liabilities) (136.3) (102.6)
Net contract liabilities $ (125.4) (93.7)

The majority of the Company’s contract balances relate to arrangements where revenue is recognized over
time and payments from customers are made according to a contractual billing schedule. The increase in net
contract liabilities was due to customer advances which exceeded revenue recognized for performance
completed during the period. Revenue recognized for the four months ended September 30, 2023 (Successor)
and eight months ended May 31, 2023 (Predecessor) of approximately $9.3 and $69.0, respectively, was
included in the beginning contract liability balance.

Revenue recognized for the four months ended September 30, 2023 (Successor) and eight months ended May
31, 2023 (Predecessor) for performance obligations that were satisfied in previous periods, including cumulative
catchup adjustments on the Company’s long-term contracts, was not material. Capitalized amounts related to
incremental costs to obtain customer contracts and costs to fulfill contracts are immaterial.

#### (5) RESTRUCTURING AND RELATED COSTS

Restructuring activity reflects costs associated with the Company’s efforts to continually improve operational
efficiency and deploy assets to remain competitive. Restructuring expenses were $12.7, $5.9, and $10.5 for
the four months ended September 30, 2023 (Successor), eight months ended May 31, 2023 (Predecessor) and

#### (6) INCOME TAXES 

Income tax expense and deferred income tax balances are presented in the consolidated and combined
financial statements as if the Company filed its own income tax returns in each jurisdiction. Accordingly, tax
results are presented utilizing the separate return method, are not necessarily indicative of future performance
and do not necessarily reflect the results that the Company would have generated as a separate and
independent company for the periods presented.

Earnings before income taxes consist of the following:

Effective beginning with the four-months ended September 30, 2023 (Successor), substantially all U.S.
operations are owned by an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. tax purposes, which is not subject to U.S.
income tax. This results in an effective tax rate for the Successor period that is significantly lower than the
Predecessor periods, because in such prior periods the U.S. operations were owned by an entity treated as a
corporation for U.S. tax purposes, and thus were subject to U.S. income tax.

The Company accrues interest and penalties related to income taxes in income tax expense. Total interest and
penalties recognized were $0.1, $(0.3), and $0.3 for the four months ended September 30, 2023 (Successor),
eight months ended May 31, 2023 (Predecessor), and year ended September 30, 2022 (Predecessor),
respectively. As of September 30, 2023, and 2022, total accrued interest and penalties were $1.2 and $3.1,
respectively.

The U.S. is a significant jurisdiction for which the Company files income tax returns; the initial U.S. partnership
tax return will be filed in early 2024. Potential audit adjustments for tax years the Company was owned by
Emerson are indemnified under the transaction agreement. The status of other significant tax returns varies
due to the numerous legal entities and jurisdictions in which the Company operates.

Uncertain tax positions and deferred tax balances assumed in connection with the transaction are initially
estimated as of the transaction date. The Company reevaluates these items based upon the facts and
circumstances that existed as of the transaction date, with any adjustments to its preliminary estimates being
recorded to goodwill, provided that the Company is within the measurement period.

#### (10) FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 

Hedging Activities

The Company is exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Foreign currency forward contracts
are utilized, as need, to hedge foreign currency exposures impacting earnings, firm commitments, or the fair
value of assets and liabilities. As of September 30, 2023 (Successor), the notional amount of foreign currency
hedge positions was $423.5. The Company also hedges its exposure to commodity price fluctuations of copper
and aluminum. Commodity derivatives totaled approximately $137.5 (35.8 pounds) for copper and $7.2 (6.8
pounds) for aluminum. All foreign currency forward contracts and the majority of commodity derivatives are
cash flow hedges and receive hedge accounting treatment. A small percentage of the aluminum commodity
derivatives do not receive hedge accounting treatment and are marked to market through other income
(expense). The majority of the unrealized gains and losses deferred in other comprehensive income (“OCI”) as
of September 30, 2023 (Successor) are expected to be recognized over the next twelve months as the
underlying transactions occur. The following gains and losses are included in earnings and OCI:

Regardless of whether derivatives receive hedge accounting, the Company expects hedging gains or losses to
be offset by losses or gains on the related underlying exposures. The amounts ultimately recognized will differ
from those presented above for open positions, which remain subject to ongoing market price fluctuations until
settlement. Derivatives receiving hedge accounting are highly effective and no amounts were excluded from
the assessment of hedge effectiveness.

Fair Value Measurement

Valuations for all derivatives fall within Level 2 of the GAAP valuation hierarchy. The fair value of foreign
currency and copper and aluminum contracts were reported in other current assets and accrued expenses as
summarized below:

Term Loan Credit Agreement

On May 31, 2023, Merger Sub, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a credit agreement
(the “Term Loan Credit Agreement”). Upon consummation of the Acquisition on the Closing Date, Merger Sub
merged with and into EMRLD Borrower, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, with EMRLD Borrower
surviving such merger. The Term Loan Credit Agreement permitted the Borrower to borrow $450.0 and $2,275.0
under new senior secured term loan facilities, the “Term Loan A Facility” and “Term Loan B Facility” respectively
and together, the “Term Loan Facilities”. The Term Loan A Facility matures on May 31, 2028 (the “Term Loan
A Maturity Date”), and amortizes in quarterly installments in an amount equal to, (i) commencing with the last
business day of the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2025 and through and including the last business day

of the original principal amount of the Term Loan B Facility, with the remaining principal balance due in a lump
sum on the Term Loan B Maturity Date. Voluntary principal prepayments are permitted for the Term Loan
Facilities at any time, without premium or penalty, provided that any voluntary prepayment, refinancing or
repricing of the term loans under the Term Loan B Facility in connection with certain repricing transactions that
occur prior to November 31, 2023 shall be subject to a prepayment premium of 1.00% of the principal amount
of the term loans under the Term Loan B Facility so prepaid, refinanced or repriced, subject to certain
exceptions. In connection with the Term Loan Facilities, the Company incurred and paid debt issuance costs of
$100.1, which was capitalized and is amortized over the term of the Term Loan Facilities.

Borrowings under the New Term Loan A Facility bear interest at an adjusted Term Secured Overnight Financing
Rate ("Term SOFR Rate") plus a margin of between 2.25% and 2.75% per annum (based on the EMRLD
Borrower’s first lien net leverage ratio), subject to a Term SOFR Rate floor of 0.00%. Borrowings under the New
Term Loan B Facility bear interest at Term SOFR Rate plus a margin of between 2.75% and 3.0% per annum
(based on EMRLD Borrower’s first lien net leverage ratio), subject to a Term SOFR Rate floor of 0.00%. The
interest rate in effect for the Term Loan as of September 30, 2023, was 9.074% and 9.165% for the Term Loan
A Facility and Term Loan B Facility, respectively.

Dollar and Euro Notes

On May 19, 2023, Merger Sub and Emerald Co-Issuer Inc., a direct subsidiary of Merger Sub, issued senior
secured notes in the aggregate principal amount of $2,275 and aggregate principal amount of €455 (or $500.0
U.S. dollar equivalent, based on the exchange rate of approximately $1.10 per €1.00). The Dollar Notes mature
on December 15, 2030, and bear interest at a rate of 6.625% per annum starting on May 19, 2023. The Euro
Notes mature on December 15, 2030, and bear interest at a rate of 6.375% per annum starting on May 19,
2023. The effective interest rates for the Dollar Notes and Euro Notes as of September 30, 2023, were 6.855%
and 6.567%, respectively. Principal on both the Dollar Notes and Euro Notes will be payable upon maturity. In
connection with the Dollar Notes and Euro Notes, the Company incurred and paid debt issuance costs of $36.5,
which was capitalized and is amortized over the term of the Dollar and Euro Notes.

ABL Credit Agreement

On May 31, 2023, the Merger Sub entered into a credit agreement (the “ABL Credit Agreement”). Upon
consummation of the Acquisition on the Closing Date, Merger Sub merged with and into EMRLD Borrower with
EMRLD Borrower surviving such merger. The ABL Credit Agreement provides the Company with access to an
up to $700.0 senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility” and, together
with the Term Loan Facilities, the “Senior Secured Credit Facilities”). In connection with the Revolving Credit
Facility, the Company incurred and paid debt issuance costs of $21.5, which was capitalized in other assets
and is amortized over the term of the Revolving Credit Facility. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility
bear interest at Term SOFR Rate plus a margin of between 1.5% and 2.0% per annum (based on the Borrower’s
average excess availability), subject to a Term SOFR Rate floor of 0.00%. The Revolving Credit Facility also
requires a commitment fee of between 0.25% and 0.375% per annum (based on average daily revolving credit
exposure) on undrawn commitments to be paid quarterly in arrears. The Revolving Credit Facility terminates
on May 31, 2028. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had total capacity and available capacity of $397.3
and $293.4, respectively, under the Revolving Credit Facility.

The debt agreements governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Notes described above contain
covenants requiring compliance with, and govern among other things, restrictions on additional borrowings,
investments (including acquisitions) and distributions. As of September 30, 2023, and at all times during the
period, the Company was in compliance with its debt covenants.

Emerson Notes

On May 31, 2023, the Emerson Notes Issuer, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, issued two unsecured
notes, the Emerson Notes, to EMR Holdings, Inc., an affiliate of Emerson, in the aggregate amount of $2,250.0.
The Emerson Notes will mature on May 31, 2033. No debt issuance costs were incurred associated with the
issuance of the Emerson Notes. The Emerson Notes include provisions for the payment of interest on the
outstanding principal amount by adding the interest to the unpaid principal amount, which is referred to as paid


-----

in kind (“PIK”) interest. Interest compounds on a semi-annual basis. The stated interest rate of the Emerson
Notes is 5% per annum and the effective rate as of September 30, 2023, is 5.944%. Upon a change of control,

#### (13) PENSION & POSTRETIREMENT PLANS

Most of the Company's employees participate in defined contribution plans, including 401(k), profit sharing, and
other savings plans that provide retirement benefits. Total expenses related to employees participating in these
plans were $5.2, $19.2, and $20.7 for the four months ended September 30, 2023 (Successor), eight months
ended May 31, 2023 (Predecessor), and year ended September 30, 2022 (Predecessor), respectively.

In addition, certain employees in the U.S., U.K., and other countries participate in Emerson defined benefit
plans. The Company accounts for the cost of these plans as if it were a participant in a multiemployer plan.
Costs charged to the Company related to Emerson defined benefit plans were based on specific actuarially
determined service costs to Company employees. Total charges related to employees participating in these
plans were $0, $7.6, and $13.4 for the four months ended September 30, 2023 (Successor), eight months
ended May 31, 2023 (Predecessor), and year ended September 30, 2022 (Predecessor), respectively.

Certain U.S. and non-U.S. employees participate in Company specific or statutorily required defined benefit
plans. In general, the Company's policy is to fund these plans based on legal requirements, required benefit
payments, and other factors. Below are the disclosures related to these defined benefit plans.

Defined benefit plans expense includes the following components:

Actuarial gains in 2023 were largely due to increase in the discount rates used to estimate the benefit obligations
(see assumptions table below).

The projected benefit obligation (“PBO”) is the actuarial present value of benefits attributable to employee
service rendered to date, including the effects of estimated future pay increases. The accumulated benefit
obligation ("ABO") is the actuarial present value of benefits attributable to employee service rendered to date
but does not include the effects of estimated future pay increases.

The following table reflects the ABO for all defined benefit pension plans as of the September 30, 2023
(Successor) and September 30, 2022 (Predecessor) measurement dates. Further, the table reflects the

the specific spot rates along the yield curve, rather than the single weighted-average rate, to the projected cash
flows to provide more precise measurement of these costs. The expected return on plan assets assumption is
determined by reviewing the investment returns of the plans for the past 10 years plus longer-term historical
returns of an asset mix approximating the Company's asset allocation targets, and periodically comparing these
returns to expectations of investment advisors and actuaries to determine whether long-term future returns are
expected to differ significantly from the past.

The Company's asset allocations at September 30, 2023 and 2022, and weighted-average target allocations

The primary objective for the investment of pension assets is to secure participant retirement benefits by earning
a reasonable rate of return. Plan assets are invested consistent with the provisions of the prudence and
diversification rules of ERISA and with a long-term investment horizon. The Company continuously monitors
the value of assets by class and routinely rebalances to remain within target allocations. The equity strategy is
to minimize concentrations of risk by investing primarily in a mix of companies that are diversified across
geographies, market capitalization, style, sectors and industries worldwide. The approach for bonds
emphasizes investment-grade corporate and government debt with maturities matching a portion of the longer
duration pension liabilities. The bonds strategy also includes a high-yield element which is generally shorter in
duration. For diversification, a small portion of U.S. plan assets is allocated to private equity partnerships and
real asset fund investments, providing opportunities for above market returns. Leveraging techniques are not
used and the use of derivatives in any fund is limited and inconsequential. The fair values of defined benefit
plan assets as of September 30, organized by asset class and by the fair value hierarchy of ASC 820 as outlined
in Note 1, follow. Investments valued based on the net asset value (NAV) of fund units held, as derived from
the fair value of the underlying assets, are excluded from the fair value hierarchy.

Asset Classes

U.S. equities reflect companies domiciled in the U.S., including multinational companies. International equites
are comprised of companies domiciled in developed nations outside the U.S. Emerging market equities are
comprised of companies domiciled in portions of Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America. Corporate bonds
represent investment-grade debt of issuers primarily from the U.S. Government bonds include investmentgrade instruments issued by federal, state and local governments, primarily in the U.S. Other includes cash,
interests in mixed asset funds investing in commodities, natural resources, agriculture, real estate and
infrastructure funds, life insurance contracts (U.S.), and shares in certain general investment funds of financial
institutions or insurance arrangements (non-U.S.) that typically ensure no market losses or provide for a small
minimum return guarantee.

Fair Value Hierarchy Categories

Valuations of Level 1 assets for all classes are based on quoted closing market prices from the principal
exchanges where the individual securities are traded. Cash is valued at cost, which approximates fair value.
Debt securities categorized as Level 2 assets are generally valued based on independent broker/dealer bids or
by comparison to other debt securities having similar durations, yields and credit ratings. Valuation techniques
and inputs for these assets include discounted cash flow analysis, earnings multiple approaches, recent
transactions, transfer restrictions, prevailing discount rates, volatilities, credit ratings and other factors. In the
Other class, interests in mixed asset funds are Level 2, and U.S. life insurance contracts and non-U.S. general
fund investments and insurance arrangements are Level 3. Investments measured at NAV are primarily
nonexchange-traded commingled or collective funds where the underlying securities have observable prices
available from active markets and typically provide liquidity daily or within a few days.

Details of the changes in value for Level 3 assets are as follows:

#### (14) SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

Successor Period Share-based Compensation

In connection with the Acquisition, the Company created two new incentive plans for its employees’
performance and retention purposes, the Emerald JV Holdings L.P. 2023 Unit Incentive Plan ( “MIP”) and the
Long-Term Incentive Plan ( “LTIP”).

Long-Term Incentive Plan

Under the terms of the LTIP, employees are granted awards (the “LTIP Awards”) that become payable upon
meeting both a service condition (the “LTIP Service Condition”) and a liquidity event condition (the “LTIP
Liquidity Condition”). Awards issued under the LTIP have a maximum contractual term of the earlier to occur of
the date on which the vested award amount has been settled or 7 years. LTIP Awards are liability classified
since they allow for settlement in cash at the option of the Company.

Unit Incentive Plan

The MIP allows for the issuance of up to 466,881,550 units. Under the terms of the MIP, employees are awarded
stock options (“Options”) or Unit Appreciation Right awards (“UARs”). Awards issued under the MIP have a
maximum contractual term of 10 years. Options under the MIP are equity classified. UARs are liability classified
since they require settlement in cash.

During the four-months ended September 30, 2023 (Successor), the Company granted share-based payment
awards to its employees. Under the MIP, one half of the Options and UARs will vest in five (5) equal installments
on the first through fifth anniversaries of the vesting commencement date, so long as the employee remains
employed by the Company through the applicable vesting date (“Time-Vesting Units”). One half of the Options
and UARs granted under the MIP may vest upon a liquidity event based on the extent that Blackstone Capital
Partners VIII L.P. and its Affiliates (”Sponsor”) receives cash proceeds in respect of the Sponsor’s original
investment in an amount that meets certain multiples on invested capital and internal rate of return hurdles
subject to the recipient’s continued employment at the time the hurdles are met (“Performance-Vesting Units”).
Additionally, with regard to the UARs, both the Time-Vesting Units and Performance-Vesting Units may only be
exercised by an employee following a liquidity event.

The Company has elected to recognize forfeitures of Options and UARs as they occur in accordance with ASC
718, Compensation – Stock Compensation.

Options

Compensation expense for the Time-Vesting Units is recognized on a straight-line basis over the five-year
requisite service period. Performance-Vesting Units vest upon the achievement of certain liquidity events which
are not considered probable until consummated and, as such, no compensation expense has been recognized.

Share-based compensation expense for the four months ended September 30, 2023 (Successor) for the TimeVesting Options was $2.6 and was included in selling, general and administrative expenses.

The weighted average grant date fair value for Time Vesting Units and Performance Vesting Units awarded
during the four months ended September 30, 2023, was $0.34 and $0.27, respectively.

As of September 30, 2023, there was $28.4 of unamortized share-based compensation expense related to
Time-Vesting Units which is expected to be recognized over a remaining weighted average period of 4.5 years.

As of September 30, 2023, the unvested and outstanding Performance-Vesting Units were deemed not
probable, with an aggregate value of $24.3 of unrecognized share-based compensation expense.

Unit Appreciation Rights

As all UARs granted may only be exercised by an employee following a liquidity event, and achievement of
such liquidity events are not considered probable until consummated, the Company will not recognize expense
for the UARs until the occurrence of a liquidity event.

A summary of the UARs issued to employees of the Company, is as follows:

The weighted average grant date fair value for Time Vesting Units and Performance Vesting Units awarded
during the four months ended September 30, 2023, was $0.34 and $0.27, respectively.

Pricing Model Assumptions

The fair market values of the Time-Based Units and Performance-Based Units as of the grant date were
estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model that utilized significant assumptions, including a risk-free rate
interest rate, expected volatility, expected life (in years), dividend rate, and discount for lack of marketability
(“DLOM”).These assumptions were determined using the methods discussed below.

   - The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. constant maturity treasury yield curve.

   - The expected volatility is estimated based on the volatility analysis of comparable companies.

   - The expected life (in years) is based on management’s estimate of the term to achieve a liquidity


-----

event.

   - The dividend rate is 0% because the Company does not expect for the foreseeable future to pay a
dividend.

   - The DLOM, which is an amount of value in ownership interest of a security that is lost due to its absence
of marketability. DLOM is often used not only to capture incremental rate of return that market
participants may require for investing in an interest that is not marketable (such as restricted stock) but
also to capture the incremental rate of return that market participants may require for investing in illiquid
interests. Several quantitative methods have been developed to estimate the DLOM for privately held
interests. The DLOM utilized in the Company’s pricing model is the Finnerty Model, which is a
commonly used method for calculating DLOM.

The range of assumptions used to determine the grant date fair value for the Time-Based Units and
Performance-Based Units is as follows:

Pricing Model Assumptions
Risk-free interest rate 4.4%
Expected volatility 55.0%
Expected life (years) 5.0
Dividend rate 0.0%
DLOM 25.0%

Predecessor Period Share-based Compensation

Certain employees of the Company participated in Emerson’s share-based compensation plans, which include
performance shares and restricted stock units. Compensation expense was recognized based on the grant date
fair value – or in the case of liability classified awards, the fair value at each reporting date – of the awards.
Share-based compensation expense recognized for the eight months ended May 31, 2023 (Predecessor) and
year ended September 30, 2022 (Predecessor) was $16.4 and $15.6, respectively. Expense in the eight months
ended May 31, 2023 (Predecessor) period includes both historical vesting expense and acceleration of any
remaining expense related to the historical Emerson awards due to the Acquisition.

#### (15) EQUITY INTERESTS

Partnership Interests in the Successor Period

The consolidated statements of equity reflect the issuance of general partner’s interest and limited partners’
interest in connection of the Acquisition as detailed in Note 2. As of September 30, 2023, the Company has
three main classes of units, General Partner Units, issued to the general partner (“General Partner”), and Class
P Units and Common Units, issued to the limited partners (“Limited Partners”).

As of the Acquisition Date, the Company estimated the value of the Class P and Class A Units (as defined
below) using an option pricing model in a Contingent Claim Analysis ("CCA") framework. A CCA allocates the
total available proceeds to various classes of equity securities at an expected liquidity event in accordance to
the rights and distribution preferences of the holders for a range of potential exit value outcomes.
The assumptions used in the CCA model for the Class P and Class A Units were as follows:

Dividend yield 0.0%
Expected volatility (based on observed volatility for comparable companies) 55.0%
Risk-free interest rate (based on US Constant Maturity Treasury Yield) 3.7%
Expected time to liquidity event (in years) 5.0
General Partner Units

The General Partner has the exclusive power and authority to manage and control the business and operations
of the Company. The General Partner is authorized to create additional classes of equity units and can issue


-----

an unlimited number of units of any class. As of September 30, 2023, the Company has a singular issued and
outstanding unit of General Partner Units.

Limited Partners’ Preferred Equity (Class P Units)

Class P Units do not contain voting rights (subject to certain standard exceptions) but have priority with respect
to rights on the distribution of assets and dividend upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation and dissolution.
Class P Units accrete at an amount equal to 7% per annum. The holder of each Class P Unit has the option to,
if permitted by the Class P majority holder, convert the units into Class A-1 Units to participate in tag-along
rights of the General Partner LLC Agreement. In the occurrence of an initial public offering, if the price per share
of common stock is greater than the Conversion Price, all outstanding Class P Units will automatically convert
into an aggregate number of Class A-1 Units, determined by dividing the accreted amount of Class P Units by
the Conversion Price (“Mandatory IPO Conversion”). If an initial public offering occurs but does not meet the
conditions for Mandatory IPO Conversion, the class P majority holder can elect to have all of the Class P Units
converted to Class A-1 Units in the same manner as if a Mandatory IPO Conversion occurs, or, alternatively,
can elect to convert the Class P Units into a preferred security that pays interest at a 9% annual rate in cash,
on the terms and conditions set forth in the Company’s limited partnership agreement. Upon a change in control
or when the holder of Class P Unit elects to participate in tag-along rights, the Class P Units will automatically
convert into Class A-1 Units in the amount equal to the greater of the accreted amount of Class P Units divided
by the price per Class A-1 Unit or Conversion Price. The Company has 2.0 million Class P Units issued and
outstanding as of September 30, 2023.

Conversion Price

The “Conversion Price” for the Class P Units will be calculated as the product of 1.10 and the common equity
consideration in connection with the Acquisition divided by the number of Class A Units acquired by BCP Ruby
Limited Partners. The initial and current Conversion Price for the Class P Units is $1.1 dollar per unit. The
Conversion Price is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain anti-dilutive common stock events,
including stock splits, the issuance of common stock dividends.

Limited Partners’ Common Equity (Common Units)

Common Units consist of Class A-1 Units and Class A-2 Units. The Class A-2 Units are issued to management
and do not contain voting rights. Common Units rank subsequent to holders of Class P units in any distributions
or dividends. As of September 30, 2023, the Company has approximately 4,201.9 million Class A-1 units and
2.0 million Class A-2 units issued and outstanding.

Predecessor Period Equity Interests

The net parent investment balance included in the consolidated and combined Balance Sheets represents
Emerson’s historical investment in the Climate Technologies, the Climate Technologies’ accumulated net
earnings after income taxes, and the net effect of transactions with Emerson.

#### (16) RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS

Related-Party Transactions in the Successor Period

On May 31, 2023, the Emerson Notes Issuer issued the Emerson Notes to EMR Holdings, Inc., an affiliate of
Emerson, in the aggregate amount of $2,250.0. See Note 12 for further details.

Per the terms of the Transaction Agreement, the Company is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts
to enable an amount of cash, equal to 283.9 million CNY or approximately $38.9 as of September 30, 2023
(“China Holdover Cash”), net of the applicable withholding tax liability and other costs, to be repatriated to an
entity of Emerson prior to September 30, 2024, which is included in Other long-term liabilities. In addition, per
the terms of the Transaction Agreement, the Company has paid $45.0 of foreign cash to Emerson.


-----

In connection with the Acquisition, the Company and Emerson entered into a transition services agreement to
provide various support services, including human resource functions, information technology services, finance
and accounting, and other certain services from Emerson personnel, and other transitional services.

Costs incurred for Emerson-managed functions, including those through the transition services agreements,
are as follows:

Successor

Four months ended Sep 30,

2023
Information technology $ 10.3
Shared services 17.6
Other corporate costs 55.1
Total $ 83.0

The Company had an immaterial amount of sales to and purchases from Emerson affiliates for the four months
ended September 30, 2023 (Successor).

Related-party amounts reported in the Balance Sheet are as follows:

Successor
Sept 30, 2023
Accounts receivable $ 1.3
Accounts payable $                    16.3

The Company also has certain related-party lease arrangements with Emerson, refer to Note 11 for further
details.

Related-Party Transactions in the Predecessor Period

As a business of Emerson, Climate Technologies had charged for costs directly attributable to Climate
Technologies and allocated a portion of Emerson’s general corporate costs. All these costs are reflected in the
Climate Technologies’ consolidated financial statements in the Predecessor period. Management believes the
methodologies and assumptions used to allocate costs to the Climate Technologies are reasonable.

Emerson maintains a centralized information technology function that supports its business units. The services
provided include application hosting, network support, network security, messaging and technology related
services. Charges to Climate Technologies for these services were based on Emerson’s cost and Climate
Technologies’ actual usage. Emerson administers a medical insurance program for its U.S. employees in which
Climate Technologies participates and for which it records the cost of claims incurred each period. Climate
Technologies participated in other Emerson programs including, but not limited to, workers’ compensation and
general and product liability insurance. Other Emerson programs are charged to Climate Technologies based
on costs incurred and usage. Climate Technologies utilized Emerson global shared service centers that host
Company-dedicated resources providing customer facing support, engineering and back office financial
services. Costs for these resources are charged directly to Climate Technologies, with the majority relating to
employee compensation and benefits and the remaining portion relating to facility overhead. In addition, general
corporate costs incurred by Emerson and trademark and tradename royalties and supply chain services are
allocated to Climate Technologies primarily based on its proportionate share of Emerson’s total consolidated
revenue and include the cost of support functions such as procurement, logistics, marketing, human resources,
legal, finance, internal audit and other Emerson corporate functions.

Costs incurred for Emerson-managed functions are as follows:


Predecessor

Eight months ended Year ended Sep 30,

May 31, 2023 2022

Information technology $ 25.5 30.3
Insurance / other services $ 18.9 34.9
Shared services $ 28.3 35.2
Corporate costs $ 44.7 75.0
Royalties and other services $ 19.8 33.6

Climate Technologies had sales to Emerson affiliates of $6.1 and $84.0 for the eight months ended May 31,
2023 (Predecessor) and year ended September 30, 2022 (Predecessor), respectively. The change in the
Climate Technologies’ sales to Emerson affiliates is due to Emerson’s disposal of its InSinkErator business in
October 2022. Climate Technologies had purchases from Emerson affiliates of $1.6 and $1.9 for the eight
months ended May 31, 2023 (Predecessor), and year ended September 30, 2022 (Predecessor), respectively.

Related-party amounts reported in the Balance Sheet are as follows:

Predecessor
Sept 30, 2022
Accounts receivable $ 29.9
Accounts payable $ 13.8

In December 2022, Climate Technologies loaned a subsidiary of Emerson $947.3, and borrowed $947.3 from
another Emerson subsidiary, which are presented as note receivable from related party and note payable to
related party on the consolidated and combined Balance Sheet, respectively. The note receivable bears
interest at the 3-month Hong Kong Interbank CNH less 15 basis points with a minimum of 0.25%, while the note
payable is non-interest bearing. Both the note receivable and the note payable were settled in cash concurrently
as of June 30, 2023. Interest income of $1.5 and $11.0 for the four months ended September 30, 2023
(Successor) and for the eight months ended May 31, 2023 (Predecessor), respectively, was recorded in interest
expense, net, on these notes.

#### (17) CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS

The Company is a party to a number of pending legal proceedings and claims, including those involving general
and product liability (including asbestos), and other matters. The Company accrues for such liabilities when it
is probable that future costs will be incurred, and such costs can be reasonably estimated. Accruals are based
on developments to date; management's estimates of the outcomes of these matters; the Company's
experience in contesting, litigating and settling similar matters; and any related insurance coverage. While the
Company believes a material adverse impact is unlikely, it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of
these matters. Given the inherent uncertainty of litigation, a remote possibility exists that a future development
could have a material adverse impact on the Company.

The Company engages an outside expert to develop an actuarial estimate of its expected costs to resolve all
pending and future asbestos claims, including defense costs, as well as its related insurance receivable. The
reserve for asbestos litigation, which is recorded on an undiscounted basis, was $53.8 and $17.8 and the
insurance receivable was $26.3 and $16.6 as of September 30, 2023 (Successor) and September 30, 2022
(Predecessor), respectively. As part of the Transaction Agreement, Emerson has indemnified the Company for
asbestos claims filed against the Company for up to 7 years after the Acquisition Date, up to a maximum of
$75.0; with Emerson having the right to offset any such amount against the Emerson Notes. The Company
anticipates the total amount of claims filed during the 7-year period will be $28.5 with a related insurance
receivable of $10.0, and therefore an indemnification receivable equal to $18.5 has been recorded as of
Acquisition Date and September 30, 2023.


-----

The Company is also responsible for environmental remediation at various facilities presently or formerly
operated by the Company. The environmental remediation liability is recorded based upon the best estimate of
costs to be incurred in light of the progress made in determining the magnitude of remediation costs, the timing,
and extent of remedial actions required by governmental authorities. The actual costs the Company will incur
are dependent on final determination of contamination and required remedial action, negotiations with
governmental authorities with respect to cleanup levels, changes in regulatory requirements, innovations in
investigatory and remedial technologies, effectiveness of remedial technologies employed, the ability of other
responsible parties to pay, and any insurance or other third-party recoveries. As of September 30, 2023
(Successor), the Company has recorded, on an undiscounted basis, a total liability of $16.6 for environmental
remediation costs regarding these facilities. Approximately $3.7 and $12.9 was recorded in accrued expenses
and other long-term liabilities, respectively. As of September 30, 2022 (Predecessor) the total liability was $14.3,
approximately $3.0 and $11.3 was recorded in accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities, respectively.
As of September 30, 2023 (Successor), there were no other known contingent liabilities (including guarantees
and other claims) that management believes will be material in relation to the Company’s financial statements,
nor were there any material commitments outside the normal course of business.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors
Emerson Electric Co.:

Opinion on the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated and combined balance sheets of Climate Technologies (a
Business of Emerson Electric Co.) (the Company) as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the related
consolidated and combined statements of earnings, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of
the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2022, and the related notes (collectively, the
consolidated and combined financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated and combined financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of
September 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended September 30, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

Basis for Opinion

These consolidated and combined financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated and combined financial statements based on
our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with
the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB and in accordance with auditing
standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated and combined financial
statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing
procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated and combined financial statements,
whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures
included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated and
combined financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated
and combined financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the
consolidated and combined financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the
audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated and
combined financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.
The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated and
combined financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter
below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it
relates.

Sufficiency of audit evidence over net sales

As discussed in Notes 1, 2 and 15 to the Company’s consolidated and combined financial statements, and
disclosed in the consolidated and combined statements of earnings, the Company recorded $5.1 billion of
net sales in 2022.

We identified the evaluation of the sufficiency of audit evidence over net sales as a critical audit matter. Net
sales are recognized primarily from the sale of manufactured products at locations in multiple countries
around the world. Evaluating the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained required subjective auditor
judgment because of the geographical dispersion of the Company’s net sales generating activities. This
included determining the locations at which procedures were performed and evaluating the evidence
obtained over net sales.

The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We applied
auditor judgment to determine the nature and extent of procedures to be performed over net sales,
including the determination of the Company locations at which those procedures were to be performed. We
evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the
Company’s net sales process. At each location where procedures were performed, we assessed the
recorded net sales by selecting a sample of transactions and compared the amounts recognized for
consistency with underlying documentation, including contracts with customers and other third-party
evidence. We evaluated the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained by assessing the results of procedures
performed, including the appropriateness of the nature and extent of such evidence.

We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2022.

On October 31, 2022, Emerson announced an agreement to sell a majority stake in Climate Technologies
to private equity funds managed by Blackstone in a transaction valued at $14.0 billion. Emerson will receive
upfront, pre-tax cash proceeds of approximately $9.5 billion and a note of $2.25 billion at close, while
retaining a 45 percent non-controlling common equity ownership interest in a new standalone joint venture
between Emerson and Blackstone. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of calendar year
2023, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions.

Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation

The Company has historically operated as part of Emerson and not as a stand-alone entity. These
consolidated and combined financial statements present the historical financial position, results of
operations, and cash flows of the Company as if it had operated on a standalone basis subject to Emerson’s
control and include all accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates on a consolidated basis.
Intercompany transactions, profits and balances among CT entities have been eliminated in consolidation.
These financial statements were derived from Emerson’s financial statements and accounting records and
have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America (U.S. GAAP). Sale and purchase transactions between the Company and other Emerson affiliates
are included in the financial statements. See Note 12.

As a business of Emerson, CT has been charged for costs directly related to the Company and has been
allocated a portion of Emerson’s general corporate costs. All of these costs are reflected in these
consolidated and combined financial statements. The Company participates in various Emerson programs
which include information technology services, employee benefits, medical insurance, and other programs.
Costs associated with these programs are charged to the Company based on Emerson’s actual cost and
the Company’s relative level of usage. The Company also utilizes Emerson’s global shared service centers
and is charged for direct costs and its share of facilities overhead.

Emerson provides certain oversight and support services, including assistance with management strategy,
logistics, marketing, finance, treasury, tax, human resources, legal and other activities. Emerson also
charges royalties for use of Emerson’s trademarks and trade names and supply chain services. A charge
for these services and royalties has been allocated to the Company based principally on revenue. While
management believes the methodologies and assumptions used to allocate these costs are reasonable,
the financial statements do not purport to represent the financial position, or the results of operations,
changes in equity, and cash flows of the Company in the future, or what they would have been had the
Company operated as a stand-alone entity during the periods presented.


-----

Emerson utilizes a centralized treasury function which manages the working capital and financing needs of
all of its business operations. This function oversees a cash pooling arrangement which sweeps
participating CT cash accounts into pooled Emerson cash accounts on a daily basis. Pooled cash and nontrade intercompany balances attributable to Emerson have not been presented as assets and liabilities in
the accompanying consolidated and combined financial statements. These balances are reflected as "Net
parent investment" in the equity section of the consolidated and combined balance sheets. Changes in
these balances are reflected as "Net transfer to Emerson'' in the financing activities section of the
consolidated and combined statements of cash flows. Cash and cash equivalents from CT entities not
participating in the Emerson centralized treasury function and specifically attributable to the Company have
been reflected in the consolidated and combined financial statements.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of the consolidated and combined financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenue and expenses for the periods presented. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Foreign Currency

The consolidated and combined financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, which is the Company’s
reporting currency. The functional currency for the Company’s operations in Mexico, Argentina, Thailand,
Hong Kong, Denmark and the majority in the Middle East is U.S. dollars while most other non-U.S.
operations use the local currency. Adjustments resulting from translating local currency financial statements
into U.S. dollars are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income. Transactions denominated in
currencies other than the functional currencies are subject to changes in exchange rates with resulting
gains/losses recorded in net earnings.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of highly-liquid investments with original maturities of three months or
less.

Receivables and Allowance for Credit Losses

Receivables are shown net of allowance for credit losses. The Company monitors customer-specific
payment and write-off history as well as forward-looking trends and macro-economic factors to estimate an
allowance for credit losses.

Inventories

Inventories are primarily stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value and are valued based on standard
costs which approximate average costs. Cost standards are revised at the beginning of each fiscal year.
The annual effect of resetting standards plus operating variances incurred during each period are allocated
between inventories and recognized in cost of sales as products are sold. Following are the components
of inventories as of September 30:

2021 2022
Raw materials $ 177.6 212.7
Work in process 26.7 25.7
Finished products 168.5 210.3
Total inventories $ 372.8 448.7

Property, Plant and Equipment

The Company records investments in land, buildings, and machinery and equipment at cost. Depreciation
is computed principally using the straight-line method over estimated service lives, which for principal
assets are 30 to 40 years for buildings and 10 to 12 years for machinery and equipment. Long-lived tangible
assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate the
carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Impairment losses, if any, are recognized based on
estimated fair values if the sum of expected future undiscounted cash flows of the related assets is less


-----

than the carrying values. Following are the components of property, plant and equipment as of September
30:

2021 2022

Land $ 32.4 32.5

Buildings 578.5 572.6

Machinery and equipment 2,517.3 2,536.0

Construction in progress 116.7 196.6

Property, plant and equipment, at cost $ 3,244.9 3,337.7

Less: Accumulated depreciation (2,249.3) (2,306.0)

Property, plant and equipment, net $ 995.6 1,031.7

Goodwill and Other Intangibles

Assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method
and recorded at their respective fair values. Goodwill represents the excess of consideration paid over total
fair value of the net assets acquired. The Company conducts its annual impairment test of goodwill in the
fourth quarter and between tests if events or circumstances indicate a reporting unit’s fair value may be
less than its carrying value. If an initial assessment indicates it is more likely than not goodwill might be
impaired, it is evaluated by comparing the reporting unit’s estimated fair value to its carrying value. An
impairment charge would be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit
exceeds its estimated fair value. Estimated fair values are developed primarily under an income approach
that discounts estimated future cash flows using risk adjusted interest rates, as well as earnings multiples
or other techniques as warranted. Fair values are subject to changes in underlying economic conditions.

All of the Company’s identifiable intangible assets are subject to amortization on a straight-line basis over
their estimated useful lives. Identifiable intangible assets consist of capitalized software, intellectual
property and customer relationships and are also subject to evaluation for potential impairment if events or
circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.

No goodwill or intangible asset impairment was recorded for any of the periods presented.

Leases

The Company leases offices; manufacturing facilities and equipment; and transportation, information
technology, and office equipment primarily under operating lease arrangements. The Company determines
whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease at contract inception. An arrangement contains a lease if
the Company has the right to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the economic benefits of an
identified asset. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at lease commencement based on
the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less
are not recognized on the balance sheet and are recorded as short-term lease expenses. The discount rate
used to calculate present value is the Company’s incremental borrowing rate based on the lease term and
the economic environment of the applicable country or region.

Certain leases have renewal options or options to terminate prior to lease expiration, which are included in
the measurement of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities when it is reasonably certain they will be
exercised. The Company has elected to account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease
component for its offices and manufacturing facilities. Some lease arrangements include payments that are
adjusted periodically based on actual charges incurred for common area maintenance, utilities, taxes and
insurance, or changes in an index or rate referenced in the lease. The fixed portion of these payments is
included in the measurement of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities at lease commencement, while the
variable portion is recorded as variable lease expense. The Company’s leases do not contain material
residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants.

Noncontrolling Interests in a Subsidiary

The Company holds a 51% controlling financial interest in Alliance Compressors LLC (“Alliance”) and
therefore, the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of Alliance have been included in the


-----

Company’s consolidated and combined financial statements. The remaining 49% interest in Alliance are
accounted for as noncontrolling interests in subsidiary in the Company’s consolidated and combined
financial statements. The Alliance joint venture agreement includes contingent put options that could require
the Company to purchase the noncontrolling interests in the event of a change in control of Emerson or
Alliance. In the event that a change of control occurs, and the put options are exercised by holders of the
49% interests, the Company would be required to purchase the noncontrolling interests in Alliance for
approximately $130.

Net Parent Investment

The net parent investment balance included in the consolidated and combined balance sheets represents
Emerson’s historical investment in the Company, the Company’s accumulated net earnings after income
taxes, and the net effect of transactions with Emerson.

Revenue Recognition

In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, Revenue from Contracts with
Customers, the Company evaluates its contracts with customers to identify the promised goods or services
and recognize revenue for the identified performance obligations at the amount the Company expects to
be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract
to transfer a distinct good or service to a customer. Revenue is recognized when, or as performance
obligations are satisfied, and control has transferred to the customer, typically when products are shipped
or delivered, title and risk of loss pass to the customer, and the Company has a present right to payment.

The vast majority of the Company's revenues are performance obligations related to the sale of
manufactured products which are recognized at a point in time when control transfers in accordance with
shipping terms. In limited circumstances, contracts include multiple performance obligations, where
revenue is recognized separately for each good or service, as well as contracts where revenue is
recognized over time as control transfers to the customer.

For revenues recognized over time, the Company typically uses an input method to determine progress
and recognize revenue, based on costs incurred. The Company believes costs incurred closely correspond
with its performance under the contract and the transfer of control to the customer.

In sales arrangements that involve multiple performance obligations, revenue is allocated based on the
relative standalone selling price for each performance obligation. Observable selling prices from actual
transactions are used whenever possible. In other instances, the Company determines the standalone
selling price based on third-party pricing or management's best estimate.

Payment terms vary but are generally short-term in nature. The Company’s long-term contracts, where
revenue is generally recognized over time, are billed as work progresses in accordance with the contract
terms and conditions, either at periodic intervals or upon achievement of certain milestones. The timing of
revenue recognition and billings under these contracts results in either unbilled receivables (contract
assets) when revenue recognized exceeds billings, or customer advances (contract liabilities) when billings
exceed revenue recognized. Unbilled receivables are reclassified to accounts receivable when an
unconditional right to consideration exists, typically when a milestone in the contract is achieved. The
Company does not evaluate whether the transaction price includes a significant financing component for
contracts where the time between cash collection and performance is less than one year.

Certain arrangements with customers include variable consideration, typically in the form of rebates, cash
discounts or penalties. Other than standard product warranty provisions, sales arrangements provide no
other post shipment obligations on the Company. In most instances, returns are limited to product quality
issues. The Company records a reduction to revenue at the time of sale to reflect the ultimate amount of
consideration it expects to receive. The Company’s estimates are updated quarterly based on historical
experience, trend analysis, and expected market conditions. Variable consideration is typically not
constrained at the time revenue is recognized. See Notes 2 and 15 for additional information about the
Company’s revenues.


-----

In the years presented, the Company had one significant customer who accounted for over 10 percent of
net sales. This customer had approximately 12 to 13 percent of net sales in 2022, 2021, and 2020.

The Company records amounts billed to customers for the costs of shipping and handling in sales
transactions as revenue and such costs are not considered separate performance obligations. Shipping
and handling costs incurred by the Company were $35.5, $50.6 and $39.8 for 2022, 2021 and 2020,
respectively, and were reported in selling, general and administrative expenses.

Warranty

Warranties largely provide assurance that the product will function as intended and generally extend for a
period of one to two years from the date of sale. Warranties vary by product line and are competitive for the
markets in which the Company operates. Provisions for warranty expense are estimated at the time of sale
based on historical experience and adjusted quarterly for any known issues that may arise. Warranty costs
were, $29.7, $27.5 and $32.4, respectively, or approximately 0.6 percent, 0.6 percent and 0.9 percent of
net sales in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Supplier Finance Program

Emerson facilitates a voluntary supplier finance program (the "Program") to provide certain Company
suppliers with the opportunity to sell receivables due from the Company to the participating financial
institution in the Program. Such sales are conducted at the sole discretion of both the suppliers and the
financial institution on a non-recourse basis at a rate that leverages Emerson’s credit rating and thus might
be more beneficial to the supplier. The Company's responsibility is limited to making payment on the terms
originally negotiated with its suppliers, regardless of whether the suppliers sell their receivables to the
financial institution. Emerson and the Company do not enter into any agreements with suppliers regarding
their participation in the Program. The amount owed to the participating financial institution under the
Program and included in accounts payable was $170.8 at September 30, 2022 and $161.2 at September
30, 2021.

Fair Value Measurement

ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement, establishes a formal hierarchy and framework for measuring certain
financial statement items at fair value, and requires disclosures about fair value measurements and the
reliability of valuation inputs. Under ASC 820, measurement assumes the transaction to sell an asset or
transfer a liability occurs in the principal or at least the most advantageous market for that asset or liability.
Within the hierarchy, Level 1 instruments use observable market prices for the identical item in active
markets and have the most reliable valuations. Level 2 instruments are valued through broker/dealer
quotation or through market-observable inputs for similar items in active markets, including forward and
spot prices, interest rates and volatilities. Level 3 instruments are valued using inputs not observable in an
active market, such as company-developed future cash flows, and are considered the least reliable.
Valuations for all the Company’s financial instruments fall within Level 2. See Note 7. Carrying value
approximates fair value for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates
and commodity prices. The Company’s foreign currency exposures relate to transactions denominated in
currencies that differ from the functional currencies of its subsidiaries, principally Mexican pesos. Foreign
exchange forwards are utilized, as needed, to hedge foreign currency exposures impacting sales or cost
of sales transactions, firm commitments, or the fair value of assets and liabilities. Commodity exposures
are price fluctuations on forecasted purchases of copper and aluminum. All derivatives are associated with
specific underlying exposures and the Company does not hold derivatives for trading or speculative
purposes. The initial duration of hedge positions is less than two years.

All derivatives are accounted for under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and recognized at fair value.
For derivatives hedging variability in future cash flows, any gain or loss is deferred in equity and recognized
when the underlying hedged transaction impacts earnings. The Company’s foreign currency derivatives
and most commodity derivatives qualify for hedge accounting. Gains or losses on derivative instruments


-----

that do not receive hedge accounting treatment under ASC 815 are recognized in the income statement
immediately.

Income Taxes

The Company’s operations have historically been included in Emerson’s combined U.S. and non-U.S.
income tax returns in most locations. Income tax expense included in the financial statements has been
calculated following the separate return method, which applies ASC 740, Income Taxes, as if the Company
was a stand-alone enterprise and a separate taxpayer for the periods presented. The calculation of income
taxes on a separate return basis requires considerable judgment and the use of both estimates and
allocations that affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of
certain deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement
recognition of revenue and expenses. As a result, the Company’s deferred income tax rate and deferred
tax balances may differ from those in Emerson’s historical results.

The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of ASC 740. Under this
approach, deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. Deferred taxes result from differences between the
financial statement and tax basis of the Company’s assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted
rates in effect for the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax
benefit will not be realized. The tax carryforwards reflected in the Company’s consolidated and combined
financial statements have been determined using the separate return method.

The complexity of tax regulations requires assessments of uncertainties in estimating taxes the Company
will ultimately pay. The Company recognizes liabilities for anticipated tax audit uncertainties in the U.S. and
other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether, and the extent to which additional taxes would be
due on a separate return basis. Tax liabilities are presented net of any related tax loss carryforwards.

The Company also provides for income taxes, net of any potentially available foreign tax credits, on
earnings intended to be repatriated from foreign subsidiaries. The undistributed earnings of foreign
subsidiaries as of September 30, 2022 are considered permanently invested or otherwise indefinitely
retained for continuing international operations. Recognition of income taxes on undistributed foreign
earnings, if any, would be triggered by a decision to repatriate earnings. Determination of the amount of
taxes that might be paid on any undistributed earnings if eventually remitted is not practicable.

Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

Effective October 1, 2021, the Company adopted three accounting standard updates which had an
immaterial or no impact on the Company’s financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2022.
These included:

 Updates to ASC 805, Business Combinations, which clarify the accounting for contract assets and
liabilities assumed in a business combination. In general, this will result in contract liabilities being
recognized at their historical amounts under ASC 606, rather than at fair value in accordance with
the general requirements of ASC 805.

 Updates to ASC 740, Income Taxes, which require the recognition of a franchise tax that is partially
based on income as an income-based tax with any incremental amount as a non-income based
tax. These updates also make certain changes to intra-period tax allocation principles and interim
tax calculations.

 Updates to ASC 321, Equity Securities, ASC 323 Investments- Equity Method and Joint Ventures,
and ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging, which clarify how to account for the transition into and out
of the equity method of accounting when evaluating observable transactions.


-----

In fiscal 2021, the Company adopted two accounting standard updates and one new accounting standard
and in fiscal 2020 adopted updates to ASC 815, all of which had an immaterial or no impact on the
Company’s financial statements. These included:

 Updates to ASC 350, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other, which eliminate the requirement to measure
impairment based on the implied fair value of goodwill compared to the carrying amount of a
reporting unit’s goodwill. Instead, goodwill impairment will be measured as the excess of a reporting
unit carrying amount over its estimated fair value.

 Updates to ASC 350, Intangibles- Goodwill and Other, which align the requirements for capitalizing
implementation costs incurred in a software hosting arrangement with the requirements for costs
incurred to developer obtain internal-use software.

 Adoption of ASC 326, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses, which amends the impairment model
by requiring entities to use a forward-looking approach to estimate lifetime expected credit losses
on certain types of financial instruments, including trade receivables.

 Updates to ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, which permit hedging certain contractually specified
risk components. The updates eliminate the requirement to separately measure and report hedge
ineffectiveness and simplify hedge documentation and effectiveness assessment requirements.

#### (2) REVENUE RECOGNITION

The following table summarizes the balances of the Company's unbilled receivables (contract assets),
which are reported in Other current assets, and its customer advances (contract liabilities), which are
reported in Accrued expenses and Other long-term liabilities.

2021 2022
Unbilled receivables (contract assets) $       3.1 8.9
Customer advances (contract liabilities) (23.0) (102.6)
Net contract liabilities $     (19.9) (93.7)

The majority of the Company's contract balances relate to arrangements where revenue is recognized over
time and payments from customers are made according to a contractual billing schedule. The increase in
net contract liabilities was due to customer advances which exceeded revenue recognized for performance
completed during the period. Revenue recognized for 2022 included approximately $18.5 that was included
in the beginning contract liability balance.

Revenue recognized for 2022 for performance obligations that were satisfied in previous periods, including
cumulative catchup adjustments on the Company's long-term contracts, was not material. Capitalized
amounts related to incremental costs to obtain customer contracts and costs to fulfill contracts are
immaterial.

As of September 30, 2022, the Company's backlog relating to unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied)
performance obligations in contracts with its customers was approximately $1.0 billion. The Company
expects to recognize approximately 93 percent of its remaining performance obligations as revenue over
the next 12 months, with the remainder substantially over the subsequent two years thereafter.

#### (3) ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES

In January 2021, the Company sold its 40% interest in Ruking for $68.0 and in September 2021, sold certain
product lines for $4.1. Pretax gains of $30.1 and $2.9, respectively, were recognized related to these
divestitures.


-----

In November 2020, the Company acquired the remaining 60% equity interest it did not already own of 7AC
Technologies Inc. (7AC), a company specializing in liquid desiccant-based technology for HVAC
applications, for approximately $19.0, net of cash acquired. This acquisition is reported in the HVACR Tech
segment. The total fair value of 7AC was approximately $48.0 at the date of acquisition, including $15.1
and $23.0 allocated to In-process research and development (IPR&D) and goodwill, respectively. CT
recognized a gain of $16.7 related to the excess of the fair value of its previously held equity investment
over its carrying value.

In March 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of Verdant, a leader in energy management
solutions for the hotel and hospitality industries, for approximately $97.3, net of cash acquired. This
business, which had annual sales of approximately $25.0 at the time of acquisition and is reported in the
Comfort Control segment, broadens CT’s growing energy management and optimization capabilities for
residential and commercial applications. The Company recognized goodwill of $58.9 (none of which is
expected to be tax deductible), identifiable intangible assets of $38.7, primarily intellectual property and
customer relationships with a weighted-average useful life of approximately 7 years, and deferred tax
liabilities of $9.2. Results of operations for the year ended September 30, 2020 included first year pretax
acquisition accounting charges related to inventory and deferred revenue of $1.2 and $0.3, respectively.

#### (4) OTHER DEDUCTIONS (INCOME), NET

Other deductions (income), net, are summarized as follows:

2020 2021 2022
Environmental expenses $ 1.0 0.8 1.2
Restructuring expense (see Note 5) 16.7 12.3 10.5
Amortization of intangibles 22.1 23.0 21.1

Total $ 48.0 (12.6) 25.3

Other, net is composed of several items that are individually immaterial including, bad debt expense, losses
on disposals of property, plant and equipment and other items.

#### (5) RESTRUCTURING COSTS

Restructuring activity reflects costs associated with the Company's efforts to continually improve
operational efficiency and deploy assets to remain competitive. Restructuring expenses were $10.5, $12.3
and $16.7, for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Restructuring expense by business segment follows:

2020 2021 2022
HVACR Tech $ 9.9 6.8 7.0
Comfort Control 1.3 1.3 1.4
Cold Chain 5.3 3.4 0.7

Costs incurred in 2022 included startup costs from moving certain production from the US to Mexico,
shutdown costs related to contractual termination in Asia and severance and benefit costs related to a
reduction in force in Europe and an early retirement program in the US. Actions in 2022 resulted in total
workforce reductions of 61 positions.

Costs incurred in 2021 included severance and benefits related to moving certain production from the US
to Mexico, the reduction of 100 positions related to the transfer of responsibilities to Emerson sharedservice centers and workforce reductions in the US. Actions in 2021 resulted in total workforce reductions
of approximately 400 positions.

Costs incurred in 2020 included severance and benefits related to reductions in force in the US, Mexico,
Europe, and Asia to improve operating margins. These actions resulted in the elimination of approximately
300 positions. Shutdown costs were also incurred from contract termination related to a facility in Europe.

expense is $28.7 in 2023, $25.2 in 2024, $22.0 in 2025, $20.0 in 2026, and $15.3 in 2027.

#### (7) FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Hedging Activities

The Company is exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Foreign currency forward
contracts are utilized to hedge anticipated costs of sales primarily denominated in Mexican Peso. As of
September 30, 2022, the notional amount of foreign currency hedge positions was $342.0. The Company
also hedges its exposure to commodity price fluctuations of copper and aluminum. Commodity derivatives
totaled approximately $106.7 (31.3 million pounds) for copper and $5.4 (5.5 million pounds) for aluminum.
All foreign currency forward contracts and the majority of commodity derivatives are cash flow hedges and
receive hedge accounting treatment. A small percentage of the aluminum commodity derivatives do not
receive hedge accounting treatment and are marked to market through other income (deductions). The
majority of the unrealized gains and losses deferred in OCI as of September 30, 2022 are expected to be
recognized over the next twelve months as the underlying transactions occur. The following gains and
losses are included in earnings and other comprehensive income (OCI):

Regardless of whether derivatives receive hedge accounting, the Company expects hedging gains or
losses to be offset by losses or gains on the related underlying exposures. The amounts ultimately
recognized will differ from those presented above for open positions, which remain subject to ongoing
market price fluctuations until settlement. Derivatives receiving hedge accounting are highly effective and
no amounts were excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness.

#### (9) RETIREMENT PLANS

Most of the Company’s employees participate in defined contribution plans, including 401(k), profit sharing,
and other savings plans that provide retirement benefits. Total expenses related to employees participating
in these plans were $20.7, $17.6, and $16.3 for 2022, 2021, and 2020 respectively.

In addition, certain employees in the U.S., U.K., and other countries participate in Emerson defined benefit
plans. The Company accounts for the cost of these plans as if it were a participant in a multiemployer plan.
Costs charged to the Company related to Emerson defined benefit plans were based on specific actuarially
determined service costs of Company employees. Total charges related to employees participating in these
plans were $13.4, 13.0, and 13.8 for 2022, 2021, and 2020 respectively.

Certain U.S. and non-U.S. employees participate in Company specific or statutorily required defined benefit
plans. In general, the Company’s policy is to fund these plans based on legal requirements, required benefit
payments, and other factors. Below are the disclosures related to these defined benefit plans.

Actuarial gains in 2022 were largely due to increase in the discount rates used to estimate the benefit
obligations for the U.S. and non-US plans, which were 5.65% and 4.82% at September 30, 2022 compared
to 3.03% and 2.26% at September 30, 2021, respectively. Actuarial gains in 2021 were largely due to an
increase in the discount rate used to estimate the benefit obligations for the U.S. plan, which was 3.03% at
September 30, 2021, compared to 2.94% at September 30, 2020. As of September 30, 2022, U.S. plans
were overfunded by $13.1 and non-U.S. plans were underfunded by $41.9. The non-U.S. funded status
includes unfunded plans totaling $41.9.


-----

As of the September 30, 2022 and 2021 measurement dates, the plans' total accumulated benefit obligation
was $105.1 and $145.7, respectively. The total projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation
and fair value of plan assets for individual plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets
were $44.7, $36.2 and $2.4, respectively, for 2022, and $103.4, $89.2 and $39.2, respectively, for 2021.
The total projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for
individual plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $42.3, $34.8 and $0.2,
respectively, for 2022, and $100.9, $87.8 and $36.8, respectively, for 2021.

Future benefit payments by U.S. plans are estimated to be $3.4 in 2023, $3.6 in 2024, $3.7 in 2025, $3.7
in 2026, $3.8 in 2027 and $19.6 in total over the five years 2028 through 2032. Based on foreign currency
exchange rates as of September 30, 2022, future benefit payments by non-U.S. plans are estimated to be
$3.3 in 2023, $3.3 in 2024, $3.3 in 2025, $3.4 in 2026, $4.0 in 2027 and $26.8 in total over the five years
2028 through 2032. The Company expects to contribute approximately $1.0 to its retirement plans in 2023.
Company defined benefit pension plan expense for 2023 is expected to be approximately $1.9, versus $4.4
in 2022.

The weighted-average assumptions used in the valuation of pension benefits are as follows:

The discount rate for the U.S. retirement plans was 5.65 percent as of September 30, 2022. An actuarially
developed, company-specific yield curve is used to determine the discount rate. To determine the service
and interest cost components of pension expense for its U.S. retirement plans, the Company applies the
specific spot rates along the yield curve, rather than the single weighted-average rate, to the projected cash
flows to provide more precise measurement of these costs. The expected return on plan assets assumption
is determined by reviewing the investment returns of the plans for the past 10 years plus longer-term
historical returns of an asset mix approximating the Company's asset allocation targets, and periodically
comparing these returns to expectations of investment advisors and actuaries to determine whether longterm future returns are expected to differ significantly from the past.


-----

The Company's asset allocations at September 30, 2022 and 2021, and weighted-average target
allocations follow:

U.S. Plans Non-U.S. Plans
2021 2022 Target 2021 2022 Target
Equity securities 46% 46% 45-50% 0% 0% 0%
Debt securities 49% 49% 45-50% 1% 1% 1%
Other 5% 5% 0-10% 99% 99% 99%
Total 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% 100%

The primary objective for the investment of pension assets is to secure participant retirement benefits by
earning a reasonable rate of return. Plan assets are invested consistent with the provisions of the prudence
and diversification rules of ERISA and with a long-term investment horizon. The Company continuously
monitors the value of assets by class and routinely rebalances to remain within target allocations. The
equity strategy is to minimize concentrations of risk by investing primarily in a mix of companies that are
diversified across geographies, market capitalization, style, sectors and industries worldwide. The approach
for bonds emphasizes investment-grade corporate and government debt with maturities matching a portion
of the longer duration pension liabilities. The bonds strategy also includes a high-yield element which is
generally shorter in duration. For diversification, a small portion of U.S. plan assets is allocated to private
equity partnerships and real asset fund investments, providing opportunities for above market returns.
Leveraging techniques are not used and the use of derivatives in any fund is limited and inconsequential.
The fair values of defined benefit plan assets as of September 30, organized by asset class and by the fair
value hierarchy of ASC 820 as outlined in Note 1, follow. Investments valued based on the net asset value
(NAV) of fund units held, as derived from the fair value of the underlying assets, are excluded from the fair
value hierarchy.

Asset Classes

U.S. equities reflect companies domiciled in the U.S., including multinational companies. International
equities are comprised of companies domiciled in developed nations outside the U.S. Emerging market
equities are comprised of companies domiciled in portions of Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America.
Corporate bonds represent investment-grade debt of issuers primarily from the U.S. Government bonds
include investment-grade instruments issued by federal, state and local governments, primarily in the U.S.
Other includes cash, interests in mixed asset funds investing in commodities, natural resources, agriculture,
real estate and infrastructure funds, life insurance contracts (U.S.), and shares in certain general investment
funds of financial institutions or insurance arrangements (non-U.S.) that typically ensure no market losses
or provide for a small minimum return guarantee.

Fair Value Hierarchy Categories

Valuations of Level 1 assets for all classes are based on quoted closing market prices from the principal
exchanges where the individual securities are traded. Cash is valued at cost, which approximates fair value.
Debt securities categorized as Level 2 assets are generally valued based on independent broker/dealer
bids or by comparison to other debt securities having similar durations, yields and credit ratings. Valuation
techniques and inputs for these assets include discounted cash flow analysis, earnings multiple
approaches, recent transactions, transfer restrictions, prevailing discount rates, volatilities, credit ratings
and other factors. In the Other class, interests in mixed asset funds are Level 2, and U.S. life insurance
contracts and non-U.S. general fund investments and insurance arrangements are Level 3. Investments
measured at NAV are primarily nonexchange-traded commingled or collective funds where the underlying
securities have observable prices available from active markets and typically provide liquidity daily or within
a few days. The NAV category also includes fund investments in private equities, real estate and
infrastructure where the fair value of the underlying assets is determined by the investment manager. Total
unfunded commitments for the private equity funds were approximately $6.0 at September 30, 2022. These
investments cannot be redeemed, but instead the funds will make distributions through liquidation of the
underlying assets, which is expected to occur over approximately the next 10 years. The real estate and
infrastructure funds typically offer quarterly redemption.

Details of the changes in value for Level 3 assets are as follows:

2021 2022
Level 3, beginning $ 18.7 19.7
Gains on assets held 0.8 0.8
Purchases, sales and settlements, net 0.2 (2.9)
Level 3, ending $ 19.7 17.6

#### (10) INCOME TAXES 

The Company’s operations have historically been included in Emerson’s combined U.S. and non-U.S.
income tax returns, in most locations. Income tax expense and deferred income tax balances are presented
in the consolidated and combined financial statements as if the Company filed its own income tax returns
in each jurisdiction. Accordingly, tax results are presented utilizing the separate return method, are not
necessarily indicative of future performance and do not necessarily reflect the results that the Company
would have generated as a separate and independent company for the periods presented.

Earnings before income taxes consist of the following:

2020 2021 2022
United States $ 515.4 566.6 649.1
Non-U.S. 215.3 300.0 284.8

30, 2022 and 2021, total accrued interest and penalties were $3.1 and $2.8, respectively.

The U.S. is the major jurisdiction for which the Company files income tax returns. Examinations for the U.S.
are complete through 2013. The status of state and other non-U.S. tax examinations varies due to the
numerous legal entities and jurisdictions in which the Company operates.

Total income taxes paid were approximately $192, $169, $130, in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Most
of the $7.3 net operating losses and tax credits can be carried forward indefinitely while the remainder
expire over varying periods.

#### (11) STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

Certain employees of the Company participate in Emerson stock-based compensation plans, which include
performance shares and restricted stock units. Compensation expense is recognized based on Emerson’s
cost of the awards determined under ASC 718, Compensation – Stock Compensation. Stock-based
compensation expenses reflected in the consolidated and combined financial statements related to
Company employees were $15.6, $22.4 and $13.3 for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

#### (12) RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS

As a business of Emerson, the Company has been charged for costs directly attributable to CT and
allocated a portion of Emerson’s general corporate costs. All these costs are reflected in the Company’s
financial statements. Management believes the methodologies and assumptions used to allocate costs to
the Company are reasonable.

Emerson maintains a centralized information technology function that supports its business units. Services
provided include application hosting, network support, network security, messaging and technology related
services. Charges to the Company for these services are based on Emerson’s cost and the Company’s
actual usage. Emerson administers a medical insurance program for its U.S. employees in which the
Company participates and for which it records the cost of claims incurred each period. The Company
participates in other Emerson programs including, but not limited to, workers’ compensation and general
and product liability insurance. Other Emerson programs are charged to the Company based on costs
incurred and usage. The Company utilizes Emerson global shared service centers that host Companydedicated resources providing customer facing support, engineering and back office financial services.
Costs for these resources are charged directly to the Company, with the majority relating to employee
compensation and benefits and the remaining portion relating to facility overhead. In addition, general
corporate costs incurred by Emerson and trademark and tradename royalties and supply chain services
are allocated to the Company primarily based on its proportionate share of Emerson’s total consolidated
revenue, and include the cost of support functions such as procurement, logistics, marketing, human
resources, legal, finance, internal audit and other Emerson corporate functions.


-----

Costs incurred for Emerson-managed functions for the years ended September 30:

2020 2021 2022
Information technology $ 25.9 25.5 30.3
Insurance / other services $ 28.4 62.5 34.9
Shared services $ 30.5 32.5 35.2

respectively. The Company had purchases from Emerson affiliates of $1.9, $3.2 and $1.6 in 2022, 2021
and 2020, respectively.

Related-party amounts reported in the balance sheet as of September 30:

2021 2022
Accounts receivable $ 62.5 29.9
Accounts payable $ 25.1 13.8

#### (13) CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS

The Company is a party to a number of pending legal proceedings and claims, including those involving
general and product liability (including asbestos), and other matters. The Company accrues for such
liabilities when it is probable that future costs (including legal fees and expenses) will be incurred and such
costs can be reasonably estimated. Accruals are based on developments to date; management's estimates
of the outcomes of these matters; the Company's experience in contesting, litigating and settling similar
matters; and any related insurance coverage. While the Company believes a material adverse impact is
unlikely, it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of these matters. Given the inherent uncertainty
of litigation, a remote possibility exists that a future development could have a material adverse impact on
the Company.

The Company engages an outside expert to develop an actuarial estimate of its expected costs to resolve
all pending and future asbestos claims, including defense costs, as well as its related insurance receivable.
The reserve for asbestos litigation, which is recorded on an undiscounted basis, was $17.8 and $27.8 and
the insurance receivable was $16.6 and $22.7 as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

The Company is also responsible for environmental remediation at various facilities presently or formerly
operated by the Company. The environmental remediation liability is recorded based upon the best estimate
of costs to be incurred in light of the progress made in determining the magnitude of remediation costs, the
timing, and extent of remedial actions required by governmental authorities. As of September 30, 2022, the
Company estimated total liability for environmental remediation costs ranges from a minimum of $6.8 to a
maximum of $17.1. The actual costs the Company will incur are dependent on final determination of
contamination and required remedial action, negotiations with governmental authorities with respect to
cleanup levels, changes in regulatory requirements, innovations in investigatory and remedial technologies,
effectiveness of remedial technologies employed, the ability of other responsible parties to pay, and any
insurance or other third-party recoveries.

As of September 30, 2022, the Company estimated a total liability of $14.3 for environmental remediationand related legal costs regarding these facilities. Approximately $3.0 and $11.3 is recorded in accrued
expenses and other long-term liabilities, respectively. As of September 30, 2021, approximately $2.8 and
$11.4 is recorded in accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities, respectively.

As of September 30, 2022, there were no other known contingent liabilities (including guarantees, taxes
and other claims) that management believes will be material in relation to the Company’s financial
statements, nor were there any material commitments outside the normal course of business.

**Emerald JV Holdings L.P.**

(Dollars and Euros in millions, except where noted)

**(1) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES**

**_Description of Business_**

Emerald JV Holdings L.P. (“Emerald,” “JV NewCo,” or the “Company”) is a leading provider of compression
technologies, electronics and controls products, as well as components, software and solutions that broadly serve
applications across the Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning and Refrigeration (“HVACR”) and Industrial
industries. The Company’s businesses are primarily organized by product offering. The Company’s products are
organized into two broad categories - HVACR Technologies and Electronics and Controls. Geographically, we
organize through three world areas - Americas, Asia, Middle East and Africa (“AMEA”) and Europe. The served
applications include, among others, heating and cooling including heat pump applications, food service / retail /
industrial refrigeration, perishable goods, transportation, healthcare / life sciences, and renewable energy. The
Company’s compression technologies enable higher efficiency in commercial and residential HVAC units, as well as
in commercial and industrial refrigeration units. The Company also has a solution portfolio that manages, monitors
and controls refrigeration units in the commercial setting, as well as software solutions that measure and monitor
temperature conditions of refrigerated goods in transit. The Company’s industrial products are designed into
renewable energy processes including RNG and Biogas applications. In general, the company’s technologies and
solutions address global trends, including (i) the decarbonization and increased energy efficiency of heating, cooling,
refrigeration, and industrial processes, (ii) the drive towards lower-GWP refrigerants, and (iii) the efficient transport
of perishable goods including food and medicine. The Company now operates under the Copeland brand, as well as
the Sensi, Verdant, Vilter and White-Rodgers sub-brands.

Emerald JV Holdings L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, was formed by Emerson Electric Co. (“Emerson”), to hold
its Climate Technologies Business (“Climate Technologies”) in connection with the acquisition of a majority stake in
Climate Technologies (the “Acquisition”) by certain investment funds affiliated with Blackstone Inc. (“Blackstone”).
The Company currently holds Climate Technologies, after the completion of certain restructuring steps undertaken by
Emerson to transfer Climate Technologies to JV NewCo (the “Restructuring”). As Emerald JV Holdings L.P. did not
have any previous operations, Climate Technologies is viewed as the predecessor to the Company and its consolidated
subsidiaries. Accordingly, these consolidated financial statements include certain historical consolidated financial and
other data for Climate Technologies for periods prior to the completion of the Acquisition.

**_Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation_**

As a result of the Acquisition as further discussed in Note 2, periods prior to May 31, 2023 reflect the financial
statements of Climate Technologies prior to the Acquisition (referred to herein as the “Predecessor” period). Periods
subsequent to May 31, 2023 reflect the financial statements of the Company after the Acquisition (referred to herein
as the “Successor” period). The Company’s assets and liabilities were adjusted to fair value on the closing date of the
Acquisition. Due to the change in the basis of accounting, the consolidated and combined financial statements for the
Predecessor and the consolidated financial statements for the Successor are not comparable. Where applicable, a
“black line” separates the Successor and Predecessor periods to highlight the lack of comparability.

The Successor Statement of Operations reflects the results of the business following the closing of the Acquisition.
However, on May 19, 2023, Emerald Debt Merger Sub L.L.C (“Merger Sub”), a subsidiary of Emerald JV Holdings,
L.P., and which was merged with and into EMRLD Borrower LP (“EMRLD Borrower”) on the Acquisition Date (as
defined below), and Emerald Co-Issuer Inc., a direct subsidiary of Merger Sub (“Co-Issuer,” together with EMRLD
Borrower, the “Issuers”), issued senior secured notes in the aggregate principal amount of $2,275.0 and aggregate
principal amount of €455.0 (or $500.0 U.S. dollar equivalent, based on the exchange rate of approximately $1.10 per
€1.00), the “Original Dollar Notes” and “Original Euro Notes”, respectively and collectively the “Original Notes”.


-----

This report includes historical consolidated financial statements and certain financial data of the Company in lieu of
consolidated financial statements and financial data for EMRLD Borrower, the borrower under the Senior Secured
Credit Facilities (defined below) and an issuer of the Notes and the direct subsidiary of EMRLD Guarantor LP
(“Holdings”). The Company does not have any material operating, investing, or financing activities other than being
(i) the issuer of the Preferred Equity and (ii) a holding company for EMRLD Seller Notes Issuer LP (the “Emerson
Notes Issuer”) and Holdings and its subsidiaries. Accordingly, with the exception of the Preferred Equity issued by
the Company (see Note 15 for further details), and the Emerson Notes (defined below) issued by the Emerson Notes
Issuer (see Note 12 for further details), the consolidated Balance Sheet and results of operations of Holdings and its
subsidiaries, including EMRLD Borrower, would be substantially identical to those of the Company and its
subsidiaries for the periods for which financial information is presented in this report.

Prior to the consummation of the Acquisition, Climate Technologies had historically operated as part of Emerson and
not as a standalone entity. The consolidated and combined financial statements for the Predecessor period present the
historical financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of the Company as if it had operated on a standalone
basis subject to Emerson’s control and include all accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates on a
consolidated basis. Intercompany transactions, profits and balances among Climate Technologies entities have been
eliminated in consolidation. The Predecessor period consolidated and combined financial statements were derived
from Emerson’s financial statements and accounting records and have been prepared in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). Sale and purchase transactions between
the Company and other Emerson affiliates are included in the consolidated financial statements. See Note 16 for
further details.

As a business of Emerson, during the Predecessor period, Climate Technologies was charged for costs directly related
to the Company and has been allocated a portion of Emerson’s general corporate costs. These costs are reflected in
the consolidated and combined financial statements. The Company participated in various Emerson programs which
include information technology services, employee benefits, medical insurance, and other programs. Costs associated
with these programs were charged to the Company based on Emerson’s actual cost and the Company’s relative level
of usage. The Company also utilized Emerson’s global shared service centers and was charged for direct costs and its
share of facilities overhead.

Emerson provided certain oversight and support services, including assistance with management strategy, logistics,
marketing, finance, treasury, tax, human resources, legal and other activities. Emerson also charged royalties for use
of Emerson’s trademarks and trade names and supply chain services. A charge for these services and royalties was
allocated to the Company based principally on revenue. While management believes the methodologies and
assumptions used to allocate these costs were reasonable, the consolidated and combined financial statements for the
Predecessor period do not purport to represent the financial position, or the results of operations, changes in equity,
and cash flows of the Company for the Successor period or in the future, or what they would have been had the
Company operated as a standalone entity during the Predecessor periods presented.

In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed and consolidated financial statements include
all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of operating results for the interim periods presented. Adjustments
consist of normal and recurring accruals. The unaudited condensed and consolidated financial statements included
herein do not include all disclosures required for interim financial statements presented in conformity with U.S.
GAAP. However, the Company believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not
misleading. The unaudited condensed and consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the
audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended September 30, 2023 and the notes thereto. The
Company has applied the same accounting policies between Predecessor and Successor periods. Certain information
has been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

**_Adopted Accounting Pronouncements_**

In September 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-04, “Liabilities - Supplier Finance Program (Subtopic 405-50):
Disclosure of Supplier Program Finance Obligations”, which requires that a company that enters into a supplier finance
program disclose sufficient information about the program to allow a user of financial statements to understand the
program’s nature, activity during the period, changes from period to period, and potential magnitude. To achieve that
objective, the company should disclose qualitative and quantitative information about its supplier finance programs.


-----

The Company early adopted this standard on September 30, 2023, except for the amendment on roll forward
information which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. See Note 10 for more information
regarding the Company’s supplier finance program. There were no new accounting pronouncements adopted during
the six months ended March 31, 2024 (Successor).

**(2) BUSINESS COMBINATIONS**

On October 30, 2022, the Company entered into a Transaction Agreement (“Transaction Agreement”) with Emerson,
BCP Emerald Aggregator L.P. (“BCP”) and Merger Sub whereby BCP agreed to purchase, and Emerson agreed to
sell, equity interests in JV NewCo following the Restructuring, for a purchase price of $13,647.1, as detailed below.
The Acquisition was consummated on May 31, 2023 (the “Acquisition Date”).

The Acquisition is accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting which requires, among other things, that
the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their estimated fair values (based on Level 3
measurements) as of the Acquisition Date. Additional information existing as of the Acquisition Date, but unknown
to us, may become known during the remainder of the measurement period, not to exceed 12 months from the
Acquisition Date, which may result in changes to the purchase price allocation.

The following tables summarize the purchase consideration and the provisional purchase price allocation to estimated
fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The preliminary calculation of the total
consideration and allocation of the purchase price to the fair value of the Company’s assets acquired and liabilities
assumed has not been completed. The detailed valuations necessary to estimate the fair value of the assets acquired
and liabilities assumed and, accordingly, the adjustments to record the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair
value reflects the best estimates based on the information currently available and are subject to change once additional
analyses are completed. During the first six months of fiscal 2024, the Company identified and recorded certain
immaterial measurement period adjustments based on changes to the preliminary assessment of the fair value of assets
acquired and liabilities assumed.

(1) As previously disclosed in the Company’s 2023 year end audited financial statements.

Goodwill is primarily attributable to assembled workforce, expected synergies, and other factors. Goodwill is
generally not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.

The fair values of the identifiable intangible assets acquired at the Acquisition Date are as follows:

**Weighted-Average**

**Acquisition Date** **Useful Life**
**Fair Value** **(Years)**

Customer relationships ..................................................................... $ 4,250.0 12.88

Total identifiable intangible assets acquired ................................. $ 6,582.0

The fair values of our trade name and developed technology were determined using relief from royalty methodology.
The fair values of our customer relationships and backlog were determined using multi-period excess earnings


-----

methodology. The valuations of intangible assets incorporate significant unobservable inputs and require significant
judgment and estimates, including the amount and timing of future cash flows.

Customer relationships, developed technology, trade name and backlog are amortized over the respective useful lives
and the expense is recorded in the amortization of intangibles financial statement line item within the unaudited
condensed and consolidated Statement of Operations.

The Company recognized approximately $25.2 and $43.8 of transaction and separation costs in the Successor period
for the three and six months ended March 31, 2024, respectively. These costs are recorded in Transaction and
separation expenses in the unaudited condensed and consolidated Statements of Operations.

**(3) REVENUE RECOGNITION**

The following table summarizes the balances of the Company’s unbilled receivables (contract assets), which are
reported in other current assets, and its customer advances (contract liabilities), which are reported in accrued expenses
and other long-term liabilities.

March 31, 2024 September 30, 2023
Unbilled receivables (contract assets) $ 11.8 10.9
Customer advances (contract liabilities) (154.1) (136.3)

Net contract liabilities ................................................................... $ (142.3) (125.4)

The majority of the Company’s contract balances relate to arrangements where revenue is recognized over time and
payments from customers are made according to a contractual billing schedule. The increase in net contract liabilities
was due to customer advances which exceeded revenue recognized for performance completed during the period.
Revenue recognized for the three and six months ended March 31, 2024 (Successor) of approximately $56.2 and
$59.9, respectively, and three and six months ended March 31, 2023 (Predecessor) of approximately $15.2 and $27.6,
respectively, was included in the beginning contract liability balance.

Revenue recognized for the three and six months ended March 31, 2024 (Successor) and three and six months ended
March 31, 2023 (Predecessor) for performance obligations that were satisfied in previous periods, including
cumulative catchup adjustments on the Company’s long-term contracts, was not material. Capitalized amounts related
to incremental costs to obtain customer contracts and costs to fulfill contracts are immaterial.

_Disaggregation of Net Sales_

The following table presents net sales disaggregated by region:

(1) For the three and six months ended March 31, 2024 Successor amount includes $0.2 and $17.2 and of foreign
currency transaction loss related to the Euro Notes. See Note 12 for further details.

**(5) RESTRUCTURING AND RELATED COSTS**

Restructuring activity reflects costs associated with the Company’s efforts to continually improve operational
efficiency and deploy assets to remain competitive. Restructuring expenses were $10.4 and $19.1 for the three and six
months ended March 31, 2024 (Successor), respectively, and $0.9 and $2.4 for the three and six months ended March
31, 2023 (Predecessor), respectively.

The change in the liability for the restructuring of operations during the three and six months ended March 31, 2024
(Successor) follows:

**Successor**
September 30, 2023 ...................................................................................................................... $ 10.8
Expense .................................................................................................................................. 8.7
Utilized/Paid .......................................................................................................................... (9.2)

Expense .................................................................................................................................. 10.4
Utilized/Paid .......................................................................................................................... (8.1)
March 31, 2024 ............................................................................................................................. $ 12.6

The change in the liability for the restructuring of operations during the three and six months ended March 31, 2023
(Predecessor) follows:

**Predecessor**
September 30, 2022 ...................................................................................................................... $ 15.7

March 31, 2023 ............................................................................................................................. $ 12.0

(1) Includes expense reversal of $1.7 and $0.5, respectively due to change in initial estimates.

**(6) INCOME TAXES**

Income tax (benefit) expense was $(0.8) and $64.6 resulting in effective tax rates of 0.6% and 23.4% for the three
months ended March 31, 2024 (Successor) and three months ended March 31, 2023 (Predecessor), respectively.
Income tax expense was $0.5 and $132.8 resulting in effective tax rates of (0.2%) and 30.1% for the six months ended
March 31, 2024 (Successor) and six months ended March 31, 2023 (Predecessor), respectively.


-----

Beginning with the Successor period, substantially all U.S. operations are owned by an entity treated as a partnership
for U.S. tax purposes, which generally is not subject to U.S. income tax. This results in an effective tax rate for the
Successor period that is significantly lower than the Predecessor periods, because in such prior periods the U.S.
operations were owned by an entity treated as a corporation for U.S. tax purposes, and thus were subject to U.S.
income tax.

For the three and six months ended March 31, 2024, pursuant to Section 4.6(d) of the Amended and Restated Limited
Partnership Agreement, the Company paid a cash distribution of $69.2 to fund its partners’ quarterly estimated tax
liability. For the three and six months ended March 31, 2024, the Company also made direct tax payments on behalf
of the Partners of $0.4 and $0.7, respectively.

**(7) INVENTORIES**

Total inventories .......................................................................................... $ 487.0 438.7

As of March 31, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company’s inventories balance includes reserves of $24.2 and
$25.4, respectively.

**(8) PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, NET**

Less: Accumulated depreciation .................................................................. (197.3) (75.6)

Property, plant and equipment, net ........................................................... $ 1,877.1 1,857.8

Depreciation expense was $62.0 and $121.8 for the three and six months ended March 31, 2024 (Successor),
respectively, and $34.6 and $68.3 for three and six months ended March 31, 2023 (Predecessor), respectively.

The Company capitalizes interest on borrowings during active construction periods for capital projects. Capitalized
interest is added to the cost of the construction in process and is placed into service periodically and is depreciated
over the approximate useful lives of the underlying assets. The Company capitalized $6.6 and $13.2 during the three
and six months ended March 31, 2024 (Successor), respectively, and did not have any capitalized interest expense for
the three and six months ended March 31, 2023 (Predecessor).

Net carrying amount ..................... $ 4,112.8 1,235.6 848.3 — 6,196.7

Total intangible asset amortization expense, excluding capitalized software amortization expense, was $143.1 and
$286.2 for the three and six months ended March 31, 2024 (Successor), respectively, and $5.5 and $10.5 for the three
and six months ended March 31, 2023 (Predecessor), respectively, which is included in the Amortization of intangibles
financial statement line item on the condensed and consolidated Statements of Operations.

The Company continually evaluates financial performance, economic conditions and other relevant developments in
assessing if a triggering event indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of any of the Company’s
reporting units or definite-lived or long-lived assets is not recoverable. The Company continues to monitor various
financial and economic conditions impacting the Company, including changes in interest rates and cost of capital, as
well as the company’s financial performance relative to long-term projections, including sales, raw material, supply
chain, and logistics cost volatility, among other factors. The Company concluded that these and other factors which
have and continue to impact the Company did not represent a triggering event as of March 31, 2024. The Company
continues to take action to offset these headwinds including, but not limited to, implementing global pricing initiatives
aimed at offsetting raw material costs. However, if the Company is unable to successfully implement these actions
and future or projected financial performance declines, then it is possible any of these financial or economic conditions
could represent a triggering event in the future and could lead to a potential impairment of the Company’s reporting
unit goodwill or other definite-lived or long-lived assets.

**(10) OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

**_Supplier Finance Program_**

The Company facilitates a voluntary supplier finance program (the “Program”) to provide certain suppliers with the
opportunity to sell receivables due from the Company to the participating financial institution in the Program. Such
sales are conducted at the sole discretion of both the suppliers and the financial institution on a non-recourse basis at
a rate that leverages the Company’s credit rating and thus might be more beneficial to the supplier. The Company’s
responsibility is limited to making payment on the terms originally negotiated with its suppliers, regardless of whether
the suppliers sell their receivables to the financial institution. The amount owed to the participating financial institution
under the Program and included in accounts payable was $114.8 at March 31, 2024 and $92.3 at September 30, 2023.

Significant items reported in accrued expenses are as follows:

**March 31,** **September**
**2024** **30, 2023**

Salaries and other employee compensation ........................................................ $ 65.3 84.7

Customer rebates and quantity discounts ............................................................ 57.0 64.8
Product warranty liabilities ................................................................................. 39.6 42.1

The changes in product warranty liabilities are as follows for the six months ended March 31:

**Six Months Ended March 31,**
**Successor** **Predecessor**
**2024** **2023**
Balance, September 30, ...................................................................................... $ 42.1 10.7

Research and development expense reported in earnings was $47.7 and $95.1 during the three and six months ended
March 31, 2024 (Successor), respectively, and $48.2 and $95.2 during the three and six months ended March 31, 2023
(Predecessor), respectively.

**(11) FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS**

**_Hedging Activities_**

The Company is exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Foreign currency forward contracts are
utilized to hedge anticipated costs of sales primarily denominated in Mexican Peso. As of March 31, 2024 (Successor),
the notional amount of foreign currency hedge positions was $402.1. The Company also hedges its exposure to
commodity price fluctuations of copper and aluminum. Commodity derivatives totaled approximately $121.6 (31.8
pounds) for copper and $5.1 (5.0 pounds) for aluminum. The majority of foreign currency forward contracts and the
majority of commodity derivatives are cash flow hedges and receive hedge accounting treatment. A small percentage
of the aluminum commodity and foreign currency fair value derivatives do not receive hedge accounting treatment
and are marked to market through other income (deductions). The majority of the unrealized gains and losses deferred
in other comprehensive income (“OCI”) as of March 31, 2024 (Successor) are expected to be recognized over the next
twelve months as the underlying transactions occur.

The following gains and losses are included in earnings and OCI:

**Into Earnings**
**Three Months Ended March 31,** **Six Months Ended March 31,**
**Successor** **Predecessor** **Successor** **Predecessor**
**2023** **2024** **2024** **2023**
Commodity Cost of sales $ (0.4) (1.7) (2.0) (9.9)
Commodity Other expenses, net — — — 0.1
Foreign currency Cost of sales 9.5 5.9 18.1 10.8
Foreign currency Other expenses, net 0.5 — 2.0 —
**Total** 9.6 4.2 18.1 1.0

**Into OCI**
**Three Months Ended March 31,** **Six Months Ended March 31,**
**Successor** **Predecessor** **Successor** **Predecessor**
**2023** **2024** **2024** **2023**
Commodity Cost of sales $ 4.4 8.2 7.7 19.0
Foreign currency Cost of sales 8.5 12.3 16.1 13.3
**Total** 12.9 20.5 23.8 32.3

Regardless of whether derivatives receive hedge accounting, the Company expects hedging gains or losses to be offset
by losses or gains on the related underlying exposures. The amounts ultimately recognized will differ from those
presented above for open positions, which remain subject to ongoing market price fluctuations until settlement.
Derivatives receiving hedge accounting are highly effective and no amounts were excluded from the assessment of
hedge effectiveness.

**_Fair Value Measurement_**

Valuations for all derivatives fall within Level 2 of the GAAP valuation hierarchy. The fair value of foreign currency
and copper and aluminum contracts were reported in other current assets and accrued expenses as summarized below:

**March 31, 2024** **September 30, 2023**
**Assets** **Liabilities** **Assets** **Liabilities**
Foreign currency ...................................... $ 32.0 (1.5) 32.2 (1.0)

_Term Loan Credit Agreement_

On May 31, 2023, Merger Sub, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a credit agreement (the
“Term Loan Credit Agreement”). Upon consummation of the Acquisition on the Closing Date, Merger Sub merged
with and into EMRLD Borrower, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, with EMRLD Borrower surviving such
merger. The Term Loan Credit Agreement permitted the Borrower to borrow $450.0 and $2,275.0 under new senior
secured term loan facilities, the “Term Loan A Facility” and “Original Term Loan B Facility” respectively and
together, the “Original Term Loan Facilities”. On February 6, 2024, EMRLD Borrower entered into an amendment to
the Term Loan Credit Agreement, which provided for the incurrence of a new senior secured term “B” loan (the “New
Term Loan B Facility”) in an aggregate principal amount of $1,519.3, the proceeds of which, together with the
proceeds of the New Notes (defined below) and cash on hand were used to refinance all of the Original Term Loan B


-----

Facility and to pay fees, costs and expenses related to the offering of the New Notes and the New Term Loan B Facility
(the “Refinancing”).

The Term Loan A Facility matures on May 31, 2028 (the “Term Loan A Maturity Date”), and amortizes in quarterly
installments in an amount equal to, (i) commencing with the last business day of the fiscal quarter ending September
30, 2025 and through and including the last business day of the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2027, 0.625% of the
original principal amount of the Term Loan A Facility and (ii) thereafter and through and including the Term Loan A
Maturity Date, of 1.875% of the original principal amount of the Term Loan A Facility, with the remaining principal
balance due in a lump sum on the Term Loan A Maturity Date. Borrowings under the Term Loan A Facility bear
interest at an adjusted Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“Term SOFR Rate”) plus a margin of between 2.25%
and 2.75% per annum (based on EMRLD Borrower’s first lien net leverage ratio), subject to a Term SOFR Rate floor
of 0.00%.

The New Term Loan B Facility matures on May 31, 2030 (the “Term Loan B Maturity Date”), and commencing with
the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2024, amortizes in equal quarterly installments of 0.25% of the original principal
amount of the New Term Loan B Facility, with the remaining principal balance due in a lump sum on the Term Loan
B Maturity Date. Borrowings under the Original Term Loan B Facility bore interest at Term SOFR Rate plus a margin
of between 2.75% and 3.0% per annum (based on EMRLD Borrower’s first lien net leverage ratio), subject to a Term
SOFR Rate floor of 0.00%. Borrowings under the New Term Loan B Facility bear interest at the Term SOFR Rate
plus a margin of between 2.25% and 2.50% per annum (based on EMRLD Borrower’s first lien net leverage ratio),
subject to a Term SOFR Rate floor of 0.00%. Any voluntary prepayment, refinancing or repricing of the term loans
under the New Term Loan B Facility in connection with certain repricing transactions that occur prior to the six-month
anniversary of the closing of the New Term Loan B Facility are subject to a prepayment premium of 1.00% of the
principal amount of such term loans so prepaid, refinanced or repriced, subject to certain exceptions.

In connection with the Original Term Loan Facilities, the Company incurred and paid debt issuance costs of $100.3,
which was capitalized and was amortized through interest expense over the term of the Original Term Loan Facilities.
The incurrence of the New Term Loan B Facility coincided with the full extinguishment of the Original Term Loan
B Facility. The Company recognized a loss on debt extinguishment related to the unamortized issuance costs and
discount totaling $96.8 for the period ended March 31, 2024. The New Term Loan B Facility was issued at an Original
Issuance Discount (“OID”) of $1.9. In connection with issuing the New Term Loan B Facility, the Company incurred
and paid debt issuance costs of $1.7 and $1.2, respectively, which was capitalized and is amortized through interest
expense over the respective remaining term of the New Term Loan B Facility. As of March 31, 2024, $17.9 of debt
issuance costs are capitalized for the Term Loan Facilities.

The interest rate in effect for the Term Loan Facilities as of March 31, 2024, was 8.063% and 7.790% for the Term
Loan A Facility and the New Term Loan B Facility, respectively.

On May 19, 2023, Merger Sub and Emerald Co-Issuer Inc (“Emerald Co-Issuer”), a direct subsidiary of Merger Sub,
issued senior secured notes in the aggregate principal amount of $2,275 and aggregate principal amount of €455 (or
$500.0 U.S. dollar equivalent, based on the exchange rate of approximately $1.10 per €1.00) (collectively, the
“Original Notes”). The Original Dollar Notes mature on December 15, 2030, and bear interest at a rate of 6.625% per
annum starting on May 19, 2023. The Original Euro Notes mature on December 15, 2030, and bear interest at a rate
of 6.375% per annum starting on May 19, 2023. The effective interest rates for the Original Dollar Notes and Original
Euro Notes as of March 31, 2024, were 6.855% and 6.567%, respectively.

In connection with the New Term Loan B Facility, on February 6, 2024, EMRLD Borrower, a wholly owned
subsidiary of the Company, and Emerald Co-Issuer, a direct subsidiary of EMRLD Borrower, issued new senior
secured notes in the aggregate principal amount of $750.0, including $500.0 of Dollar Notes (“New Dollar Notes”)
and €230.0 (or $250.0 U.S. dollar equivalent, based on the exchange rate of approximately $1.09 per €1.00) of Euro
Notes (“New Euro Notes), collectively, the “New Notes”. The New Notes were issued as additional notes under the
indenture governing the Original Notes. The New Dollar Notes were issued at a premium of 100.750, resulting in a
premium of $3.8. The New Euro Notes were issued at a premium of 104.250, resulting in a USD premium of
approximately $10.6. The New Notes have the same terms as the Original Notes. The effective interest rates for the


-----

New Dollar Notes and the New Euro Notes as of March 31, 2024, were 6.7413% and 5.9923%, respectively. Principal
on both the Original Notes and New Notes will be payable upon maturity. In connection with the Original Notes and
the New Notes, the Company incurred and paid debt issuance costs of $47.8, which was capitalized and is amortized
through interest expense over the respective remaining term of the Original Notes and New Notes. As of March 31,
2024, $44.9 of debt issuance costs are still capitalized for both the Original Notes and New Notes.

_ABL Credit Agreement_

On May 31, 2023, the Merger Sub entered into a credit agreement (the “ABL Credit Agreement”). Upon
consummation of the Acquisition on the Closing Date, Merger Sub merged with and into EMRLD Borrower with
EMRLD Borrower surviving such merger. The ABL Credit Agreement provides the Company with access to an up to
$700.0 senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility” and, together with the
Term Loan Facilities, the “Senior Secured Credit Facilities”). In connection with the Revolving Credit Facility, the
Company incurred and paid debt issuance costs of $22.3, which was capitalized in other assets and is amortized
through interest expense over the remaining term of the Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2023, $19.0
of debt issuance costs are still capitalized. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at Term SOFR
Rate plus a margin of between 1.5% and 2.0% per annum (based on the Borrower’s average excess availability),
subject to a Term SOFR Rate floor of 0.00%. The Revolving Credit Facility also requires a commitment fee of between
0.25% and 0.375% per annum (based on average daily revolving credit exposure) on undrawn commitments to be
paid quarterly in arrears. The Revolving Credit Facility terminates on May 31, 2028. As of March 31, 2024, the
Company had total capacity and available capacity of $408.6 and $399.5, respectively, under the Revolving Credit
Facility.

The debt agreements governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Original and New Notes described above
contain covenants requiring compliance with, and govern among other things, restrictions on additional borrowings,
investments (including acquisitions) and distributions. As of March 31, 2024, and at all times during the period, the
Company was in compliance with its debt covenants.

_Emerson Notes_

On May 31, 2023, the Emerson Notes Issuer, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, issued two unsecured notes
(the Emerson Notes), to EMR Holdings, Inc., an affiliate of Emerson, in the aggregate amount of $2,250.0. The
Emerson Notes will mature on May 31, 2033. No debt issuance costs were incurred associated with the issuance of
the Emerson Notes. The Emerson Notes include provisions for the payment of interest on the outstanding principal
amount by adding the interest to the unpaid principal amount, which is referred to as paid in kind (“PIK”) interest.
Interest compounds on a semi-annual basis. The stated interest rate of the Emerson Notes is 5% per annum and the
effective rate as of March 31, 2024, is 5.944%. Upon a change of control, the Company is required to prepay the entire
principal amount, plus accrued unpaid interest through the prepayment date without any premium or penalty. The
Emerson Notes are structurally subordinated to the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Original and New Notes.

Future maturities of long-term debt as of March 31, 2024, are as follows:

Remainder of fiscal year ended 2024 .............................................................................................. $ 7.6
Fiscal year ended 2025 .................................................................................................................... 18.0

**(14) SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION**

**Successor Period**

In connection with the Acquisition, the Company created two new incentive plans for its employees’ performance and
retention purposes, the Emerald JV Holdings L.P. 2023 Unit Incentive Plan (“MIP”) and the Long-Term Incentive
Plan (“LTIP”).

During the three and six months ended March 31, 2024, the Company recognized $1.4 and $3.5, respectively, in sharebased compensation expense, which was reported in selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) in the
condensed consolidated statement of operations. All of this expense related to the Time-Vesting Options (described
further below). There were certain Time-Vesting and Performance-Vesting Options (described further below) granted
and forfeited during the three and six months ended March 31, 2024, described below.

_Long-Term Incentive Plan_

Under the terms of the LTIP, employees are granted awards (the “LTIP Awards”) that become payable upon meeting
both a service condition (the “LTIP Service Condition”) and a liquidity event condition (the “LTIP Liquidity
Condition”). Awards issued under the LTIP have a maximum contractual term of the earlier to occur of the date on
which the vested award amount has been settled or 7 years. LTIP Awards are liability classified since they allow for
settlement in cash at the option of the Company. As of March 31, 2024, the unvested and outstanding Long-Term
Incentive Plan Awards had an aggregate value of $16.1 of unrecognized share-based compensation expense.

_Unit Incentive Plan_

The MIP allows for the issuance of up to 466,881,550 units. Under the terms of the MIP, employees are awarded stock
options (“Options”) or Unit Appreciation Right awards (“UARs”). Awards issued under the MIP have a maximum


-----

contractual term of 10 years. Options under the MIP are equity classified. UARs are liability classified since they
require settlement in cash.

Under the MIP, one half of the Options and UARs will vest in five (5) equal installments on the first through fifth
anniversaries of the vesting commencement date, so long as the employee remains employed by the Company through
the applicable vesting date (“Time-Vesting Units”). One half of the Options and UARs granted under the MIP may
vest upon a liquidity event based on the extent that Blackstone Capital Partners VIII L.P. and its Affiliates (“Sponsor”)
receives cash proceeds in respect of the Sponsor’s original investment in an amount that meets certain multiples on
invested capital and internal rate of return hurdles subject to the recipient’s continued employment at the time the
hurdles are met (“Performance-Vesting Units”). Additionally, with regard to the UARs, both the Time-Vesting Units
and Performance-Vesting Units may only be exercised by an employee following a liquidity event.

_Options_

Compensation expense for the Time-Vesting Units is recognized on a straight-line basis over the five-year requisite
service period. Performance-Vesting Units vest upon the achievement of certain liquidity events which are not
considered probable until consummated and, as such, no compensation expense has been recognized.

Unvested, March 31, 2024 .................... 78,578,396 $ 0.28 86,810,063 $ 0.25

The fair market values of the Time-Based Units and Performance-Based Units granted during the first six months of
2024 were estimated using the assumptions in place for all previous grants.

As of March 31, 2024, there was $24.4 of unamortized share-based compensation expense related to Time-Vesting
Units which is expected to be recognized over a remaining weighted average period of 4.1 years.

As of March 31, 2024, the unvested and outstanding Performance-Vesting Units were deemed not probable, with an
aggregate value of $23.1 of unrecognized share-based compensation expense.

_Unit Appreciation Rights_

As all UARs granted may only be exercised by an employee following a liquidity event, and achievement of such
liquidity events are not considered probable until consummated, the Company will not recognize expense for the
UARs until the occurrence of a liquidity event. As of March 31, 2024, the unvested and outstanding Unit Appreciation
Rights had an aggregate value of $9.1 of unrecognized share-based compensation expense.

**Predecessor Period**

Certain employees of the Company participate in Emerson’s share-based compensation plans, which include
performance shares and restricted stock units. Compensation expense is recognized based on the grant date fair value
– or in the case of liability classified awards, the fair value at each reporting date – of the awards, as determined by
Emerson under ASC 718, Compensation – Stock Compensation. Share-based compensation expense for the Emerson
share-based compensation plans was $2.2 and $11.3 for the three and six months ended March 31, 2023, respectively,
and is reflected within SG&A within the condensed, consolidated and combined Statement of Operations.


-----

**(15) EQUITY INTERESTS**

**Successor Period**

The unaudited condensed and consolidated statements of equity reflect the issuance of general partner’s interest and
limited partners’ interest in connection of the Acquisition as detailed in Note 2. As of March 31, 2024, the Company
has three main classes of units, General Partner Units, issued to the general partner (“General Partner”), and Class P
Units and Common Units, issued to the limited partners (“Limited Partners”).

_General Partner Units_

The General Partner has the exclusive power and authority to manage and control the business and operations of the
Company. The General Partner is authorized to create additional classes of equity units and can issue an unlimited
number of units of any class. As of March 31, 2024, the Company has a singular issued and outstanding unit of General
Partner Units.

_Limited Partners’ Preferred Equity (Class P Units)_

Class P Units do not contain voting rights (subject to certain standard exceptions) but have priority with respect to
rights on the distribution of assets and dividend upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation and dissolution. Class
P Units accrete at an amount equal to 7% per annum. The holder of each Class P Unit has the option to, if permitted
by the Class P majority holder, convert the units into Class A-1 Units to participate in tag-along rights of the General
Partner LLC Agreement. In the occurrence of an initial public offering, if the price per share of common stock is
greater than the Conversion Price, all outstanding Class P Units will automatically convert into an aggregate number
of Class A-1 Units, determined by dividing the accreted amount of Class P Units by the Conversion Price (“Mandatory
IPO Conversion”). If an initial public offering occurs but does not meet the conditions for Mandatory IPO Conversion,
the class P majority holder can elect to have all of the Class P Units converted to Class A-1 Units in the same manner
as if a Mandatory IPO Conversion occurs, or, alternatively, can elect to convert the Class P Units into a preferred
security that pays interest at a 9% annual rate in cash, on the terms and conditions set forth in the Company’s limited
partnership agreement. Upon a change in control or when the holder of Class P Unit elects to participate in tag-along
rights, the Class P Units will automatically convert into Class A-1 Units in the amount equal to the greater of the
accreted amount of Class P Units divided by the price per Class A-1 Unit or Conversion Price. The Company has 2.0
million Class P Units issued and outstanding as of March 31, 2024.

_Conversion Price_

The “Conversion Price” for the Class P Units will be calculated as the product of 1.10 and the common equity
consideration in connection with the Acquisition divided by the number of Class A-1 Units acquired by BCP Ruby
Limited Partners. The initial and current Conversion Price for the Class P Units is $1.1 per share. The Conversion
Price is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain anti-dilutive common stock events, including stock splits,
the issuance of common stock dividends.

_Limited Partners’ Common Equity (Common Units)_

Common Units consist of Class A-1 Units and Class A-2 Units. The Class A-2 Units are issued to management and
do not contain voting rights. Common Units rank subsequent to holders of Class P units in any distributions or
dividends. During the six months ended March 31, 2024, 1.0 million Class A-2 units were issued to management for
$1.0. As of March 31, 2024, the Company has approximately 4,201.9 million Class A-1 units and 3.0 million Class
A-2 units issued and outstanding.

**Predecessor Period**

The net parent investment balance included in the condensed, consolidated and combined balance sheets represents
Emerson’s historical investment in the Climate Technologies, the Climate Technologies’ accumulated net earnings
after income taxes, and the net effect of transactions with Emerson.


-----

**(16) RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS**

**Successor Period**

On May 31, 2023, the Emerson Notes Issuer issued the Emerson Notes to EMR Holdings, Inc., an affiliate of Emerson,
in the aggregate amount of $2,250.0. See Note 12 for further details.

Per the terms of the Transaction Agreement, the Company is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to
enable an amount of cash, equal to 283.9 million CNY or approximately $39.4 as of March 31, 2024, net of the
applicable withholding tax liability and other costs, to be repatriated to an entity of Emerson prior to September 30,
2024, which is included in accrued expenses.

In connection with the Acquisition, the Company and Emerson entered into a transition services agreement to provide
various support services, including human resource functions, information technology services, finance and
accounting, and other certain services from Emerson personnel, and other transitional services.

Costs incurred for Emerson-managed functions in the transition services agreement are as follows:

**Three months ended** **Six months ended**
**March 31, 2024** **March 31, 2024**

Information technology ........................................................... $ 8.0 $ 15.4
Shared services ........................................................................ 12.7 25.3
Other corporate costs ............................................................... 38.5 82.3
Total ..................................................................................... $ 59.2 $ 123.0

The Company had an immaterial amount of sales to and purchases from Emerson affiliates for the three and six months
ended March 31, 2024.

Related-party amounts reported in the balance sheet are as follows:

**March 31, 2024** **March 31, 2024**
Accounts receivable ................................................................. $ 1.0 $ 1.3
Accounts payable ..................................................................... $ 18.1 $ 16.3

The Company leases excess owned space in the St. Louis, Missouri corporate headquarters to Emerson. The lease
commenced on May 31, 2023 with an initial lease term of 36 months and includes one option to renew for an additional
24 months. The Company recognized operating lease income from Emerson of $2.8 and $6.8 for the three and six
months ended March 31, 2024, recognized as an offset to SG&A.

**Predecessor Period**

As a business of Emerson, Climate Technologies had charged for costs directly attributable to Climate Technologies
and allocated a portion of Emerson’s general corporate costs. All these costs are reflected in the Climate Technologies’
unaudited condensed and consolidated financial statements in the Predecessor period. Management believes the
methodologies and assumptions used to allocate costs to the Climate Technologies are reasonable.

Emerson maintains a centralized information technology function that supports its business units. Services provided
include application hosting, network support, network security, messaging and technology related services. Charges
to Climate Technologies for these services were based on Emerson’s cost and the Climate Technologies’ actual usage.
Emerson administers a medical insurance program for its U.S. employees in which Climate Technologies participates
and for which it records the cost of claims incurred each period. Climate Technologies participated in other Emerson
programs including, but not limited to, workers’ compensation and general and product liability insurance. Other
Emerson programs are charged to Climate Technologies based on costs incurred and usage. Climate Technologies
utilized Emerson global shared service centers that host Company-dedicated resources providing customer facing
support, engineering and back office financial services. Costs for these resources are charged directly to Climate


-----

Technologies, with the majority relating to employee compensation and benefits and the remaining portion relating to
facility overhead. In addition, general corporate costs incurred by Emerson and trademark and tradename royalties
and supply chain services are allocated to Climate Technologies primarily based on its proportionate share of
Emerson’s total consolidated revenue and include the cost of support functions such as procurement, logistics,
marketing, human resources, legal, finance, internal audit and other Emerson corporate functions.

Costs incurred for Emerson-managed functions are as follows:

**Three months ended** **Six months ended**
**March 31, 2024** **March 31, 2024**

Information technology ........................................................... $ 9.5 $ 18.8
Insurance / other services 5.7 16.8
Shared services ........................................................................ 11.5 21.1
Corporate costs ........................................................................ 15.2 33.4
Royalties and other services .................................................... 6.3 14.3

Climate Technologies had sales to Emerson affiliates of $0.1 and $6.2 for the three and six months ended March 31,
2023, respectively. Climate Technologies had purchases from Emerson affiliates of $0.7 and $1.2 for the three and six
months ended March 31, 2023, respectively.

In December 2022, Climate Technologies loaned a subsidiary of Emerson $947.3, and borrowed $947.3 from another
Emerson subsidiary.

**(17) CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS**

The Company is a party to a number of pending legal proceedings and claims, including those involving general and
product liability (including asbestos), and other matters. The Company accrues for such liabilities when it is probable
that future costs will be incurred and such costs can be reasonably estimated. Accruals are based on developments to
date; management’s estimates of the outcomes of these matters; the Company’s experience in contesting, litigating
and settling similar matters; and any related insurance coverage. While the Company believes a material adverse
impact is unlikely, it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of these matters. Given the inherent uncertainty
of litigation, a remote possibility exists that a future development could have a material adverse impact on the
Company.

The Company engages an outside expert to develop an actuarial estimate of its expected costs to resolve all pending
and future asbestos claims, including defense costs, as well as its related insurance receivable. The reserve for asbestos
litigation, which is recorded on an undiscounted basis, was $53.8 and the insurance receivable was $26.3 as of both
March 31, 2024 (Successor) and September 30, 2023 (Successor). As part of the Transaction Agreement, Emerson
has indemnified the Company for asbestos liabilities up to $75.0; with Emerson having the right to offset any such
amount against the Emerson Notes. The Company anticipates the total amount of claims filed during the 7-year period
will be $28.5 with a related insurance receivable of $10.0, and therefore an indemnification receivable equal to $18.5
has been recorded as of both September 30, 2023 and March 31, 2024.

The Company is also responsible for environmental remediation at various facilities presently or formerly operated
by the Company. The environmental remediation liability is recorded based upon the best estimate of costs to be
incurred in light of the progress made in determining the magnitude of remediation costs, the timing, and extent of
remedial actions required by governmental authorities. The actual costs the Company will incur are dependent on final
determination of contamination and required remedial action, negotiations with governmental authorities with respect
to cleanup levels, changes in regulatory requirements, innovations in investigatory and remedial technologies,
effectiveness of remedial technologies employed, the ability of other responsible parties to pay, and any insurance or
other third-party recoveries. As of March 31, 2024 (Successor) the Company has recorded, on an undiscounted basis,
a total liability of $15.9 for environmental remediation-and related legal costs regarding these facilities.
Approximately $3.3 and $12.6 was recorded in accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities, respectively. As of
September 30, 2023 (Successor), the Company has recorded, on an undiscounted basis, a total liability of $16.6 for


-----

environmental remediation-and related legal costs regarding these facilities. Approximately $3.7 and $12.9 was
recorded in accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities, respectively.

As of March 31, 2024 (Successor), there were no other known contingent liabilities (including guarantees and other
claims) that management believes will be material in relation to the Company’s financial statements, nor were there
any material commitments outside the normal course of business.
