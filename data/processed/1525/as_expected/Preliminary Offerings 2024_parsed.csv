1525,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Our Company,9.1.1,,"We are a leading global manufacturer of mission critical compressors, controls, components and solutions to the heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and refrigeration (“HVACR”) market. We provide products that help enhance human health and comfort, protect food quality and safety, advance energy efficiency, and create environmentally sustainable infrastructure. Key components in an HVACR ecosystem include the compressor, controls, the condenser and the evaporator. We provide best-in-class compressors, controls, components and solutions for residential, commercial, industrial and transportation applications. We are the largest global manufacturer in our served markets with approximately 40% share in overall global compression, including approximately 70% in the North America residential heating, ventilation and air conditioning (“HVAC”) segment, and strong positions within our non-compression offerings. Our large installed base of more than 150 million HVAC compressor units globally drives profitable aftermarket sales due to replacement dynamics, with approximately 80% of our net sales tied to repair or replacement activity. Ongoing technology leadership is a key driver of our ability to capitalize on the replacement cycle, as each successive generation of compressor provides greater cost savings, energy efficiency and higher levels of environmental sustainability impact. The replacement cycle is primarily driven by repair and replacement of HVACR systems. Our installed base provides a foundation for ongoing earnings resilience as systems age and require repair or replacement. Global regulations around the impact of refrigerants on global warming and the need for energy efficiency amplify replacement dynamics in our business. Globally, government programs and incentives support the adoption of new, more sustainable products creating a strong forward looking growth environment. Secular trends tied to human health and comfort, as well as food quality, safety and sustainability drive additional demand for our compression and solutions offerings. As the heart of an HVAC system, the compressor is the system’s most critical component, yet represents a small percentage of the unit cost to the consumer. For example, approximately three to five percent of the residential HVAC unit cost is associated with the compressor, but the compressor has a mission-critical impact on function and efficiency. Compressors enable the separation of the low-pressure side of an HVAC system, where heat is absorbed into the refrigerant, from the high-pressure side of the system, where heat is discharged from the refrigerant to a cooling medium (typically the ambient outside air). The compressor mechanically reduces the volume of low-side refrigerant, thereby increasing its pressure and enabling heated refrigerant to flow to the high-pressure side of the system, where it is cooled. ----- We offer a variety of compressor technologies to meet customer-specific applications. Compression technology is essential to improving system efficiency. In addition, refrigerant selection is dependent on rigorous testing by compressor manufacturers to evaluate for performance and reliability and approve for use. Globally, the HVACR system manufacturers are dependent upon compressor innovation to meet regulations for efficiency and more environmentally friendly refrigerants. Because compressors are highly engineered to meet our customers’ technical requirements, we work closely with them on engineering, research and development (“ER&D”) efforts to develop technology that meets consumer needs and complies with regulatory changes. These tightly coupled relationships result from our industry leadership and help provide us with good forward-looking visibility to market needs and opportunities to differentiate ourselves.",N/A,as_expected,2024,380

Based on our current market positioning, our global scale and flexibility of our supply chain, and our manufacturing and ER&D capabilities, we are wellpositioned to capitalize on these trends. - **Regulatory Changes: Regulatory changes have driven change and innovation in our industry for decades. However, the frequency and impact of those changes has increased in recent years. These changes include updates to seasonal energy efficiency ratio (“SEER”) requirements (and other global efficiency standards) and new standards on refrigerants that drive more frequent compressor and system innovations. The complexity resulting from these changes favors our global breadth and the depth of our engineering, technology and operations. In the United States, new efficiency regulations went into effect January 1, 2023. In 2025, new refrigerant regulations will again drive new compressors and systems into the market. Additional new regulations in the next seven to ten years are anticipated. Engineering and development efforts typically begin years in advance of the applicable regulation effective date. Our OEM customers depend on us to help them meet these requirements in a timely fashion while simultaneously helping them innovate and differentiate to meet their sustainability goals. Europe’s sustainability goals and their desire for energy sovereignty is driving goals and incentives targeting the installation of 30 million new heat pumps by 2030. - **Heat Pump Conversion: The growth of heat pumps is expected to bring new customers into the HVAC market, as households convert a furnace-only or gas-only system to a heat pump. According to a major consulting practice, consumers enjoy on average approximately $4,000 in lifetime savings from heat pumps, supported by government subsidy programs and incentives available from utility providers. Conversion to heat pumps is expected to be particularly strong in Europe, where high natural gas prices are incentivizing a transition to less energy-intensive heat pumps. The European Union (“EU”) is in the process of revising its Energy Performance Building Directive (“EPBD”) to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030, a legal obligation under the European climate law, and make the EU climate-neutral by 2050. While the revision is still under negotiation, the EPBD is expected to require member states to ensure that all new buildings after 2027 are zero-emission, and set deadlines after which the use of fossil fuel heating systems in new buildings, or in major building renovations or renovations of the heating systems, will not be permitted. Existing regulations across nine European countries have already implemented, or will implement by 2026, fossil fuel boiler bans in residential buildings. With the upcoming revision of the EPBD, we expect that all other EU member states will implement similar restrictions and the scope will ultimately comprise all existing buildings. Some countries also already provide, or are expected to provide, monetary incentives to accelerate the transition to clean heating, including heat pumps. With strong channel benefits and an existing customer base, the major legacy boilermakers are playing a critical role in the heat pump transition. Our HVAC compression expertise positions us as an important partner as legacy boilermakers help to drive heat pump adoption. Our partnership and existing share with legacy boilermakers and HVAC OEMs positions us well to enable this transition. We are currently a leader in compression for the heat pump segment in Europe. - **COVID-19 / Hybrid Working: More waking hours spent at home are expected to maintain HVAC usage above pre-COVID-19 levels, shortening system useful life. According to a major consulting practice, these new working arrangements are expected to keep replacement rates elevated as approximately 45% of employees are predicted to be in hybrid working models in the future versus approximately 10% pre-COVID-19. HVACR industry executives also expect replacement rates to remain elevated. Run times in 2020 were quoted as being 30% higher than 2019 levels (after adjusting for weather), which should correlate to higher rates of replacement over time. - **Environmental and Population Shifts: With environmental change resulting in more extreme temperatures across the United States, and a population mix increasingly shifting to warmer southern ----- states, HVAC usage has increased and is expected to continue to increase, resulting in shorter useful lives for HVAC equipment and higher replacement rates.",N/A,as_expected,2024,380

1525,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.5,Our Key Strengths,9.5.5,Resilient business model supported by established installed base and high replacement volumes,"Replacement as a percent of sales has increased to more than 85% over the last 50 years in the North America residential HVAC industry, with a current installed base of approximately 100 million units. Replacement sales are more resilient and are associated with durable spend, often outperforming gross domestic product growth rates during economic cycles. Both HVACR systems broadly and compressors specifically suffer from wear. Compressors may be replaced to extend the life of an HVACR system. Full system replacement occurs when HVACR units are beyond repair or when an end-user determines that the payback in higher efficiency, lower emissions and better reliability is sufficient to warrant the cost of replacement. Repair or replacement of a unit is non-discretionary because HVACR systems provide essential heating, cooling and refrigeration. Our resilient recovery during the 2007-2008 Global Financial Crisis speaks to the largely non-discretionary nature of HVAC repair and replacement. Despite an approximately 15% revenue contraction in 2009, our revenues rebounded quickly in 2010 with more than 19% growth before returning to normalized long-term growth rates. Over the same period, we delivered improvements in gross margin and EBITDA margin as we moved quickly to manage costs. Our cost structure is largely variable, enabling us to preserve margin during downturns such as the 2007-2008 Global Financial Crisis, the U.S. manufacturing downturn, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Secular industry tailwinds, including upcoming regulatory changes, heat pump conversion, shifts in population and the impact of hybrid working, are expected to drive an increase in HVAC usage.

On May 31, 2023, private equity funds managed by Blackstone Inc. acquired a majority interest in Emerald JV Holdings L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, and its consolidated subsidiaries pursuant to the Transaction Agreement. As a result of the Transactions, a new basis of accounting was created on May 31, 2023. Periods prior to May 31, 2023 reflect the financial statements of Climate Technologies prior to the Acquisition (referred to herein as the “Predecessor” period). Periods subsequent to May 31, 2023, reflect the financial statements of the Company after the Acquisition (referred to herein as the “Successor” period). The Company’s assets and liabilities were adjusted to fair value on the closing date of the Acquisition. Due to the change in the basis of accounting, the consolidated and combined financial statements for the Predecessor and the consolidated financial statements for the Successor are not comparable. The summary historical consolidated and combined balance sheet data as of September 30, 2022 (Predecessor) and the summary historical consolidated balance sheet data as of September 30, 2023 (Successor), the consolidated statement of operations data for the four months ended September 30, 2023 (Successor) and the consolidated and combined statements of operations data for the eight months ended May 31, 2023 (Predecessor) and for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 (Predecessor), the consolidated statement of cash flows data for the four months ended September 30, 2023 (Successor) and the consolidated and combined cash flows data for the eight months ended May 31, 2023 (Predecessor) and for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 (Predecessor) have been derived from the Company’s audited consolidated and combined financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

1525,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.1,"Our business is subject to competitive pressures that could affect prices or demand for our products. In particular, the HVACR market may experience periods of structural imbalance between supply and demand that result in periods of pricing volatility, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.","We operate in markets that are highly competitive and potentially volatile, and we compete on the basis of product performance, quality, service and/or price across the industries and markets served. Other factors that affect competition in the HVACR market include the development and application of new technologies, an increasing emphasis on the development of more efficient products and new product introductions. Our operations are significantly dependent on the current and future business environment (including capital and consumer spending) and on public funding. A significant element of our competitive strategy is to deliver solutions to our customers by manufacturing high-quality products at the best relevant global cost. Various companies compete with us in one or more product lines and the number of competitors varies by product line. Some of our competitors may have greater financial resources than we have, allowing them to invest in more extensive research and development and/or marketing activity and making them better able to withstand adverse market conditions, and we also compete with many smaller companies. There has been consolidation and new entrants (including non-traditional competitors) within our industry and there may be future consolidation and new entrants which could result in increased competition and significantly alter the dynamics of the competitive landscape in which we operate. Also, the establishment of manufacturing operations in low-cost countries could provide cost advantages to existing and emerging competitors. There is always the risk of disruptive technologies coming from companies that are not traditionally manufacturers or service providers of our products. Competitive pressures could adversely affect prices or customer demand for our products, impacting our sales or profit margins, and/or resulting in a loss of market share. We also believe that the HVACR market may, from time to time, experience periods of structural imbalance between supply and demand, and that any such excess capacity will put pressure on pricing. Such supply and demand may also be influenced by trade measures and policies, government regulations, public funding, raw material availability, and supply chain disruptions. There may be additional pressure on global demand and average selling prices in the future resulting from fluctuating demand in certain major markets. If our competitors reduce pricing to levels near or below their manufacturing costs, or are able to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time, or if global HVACR demand decreases relative to installed production capacity, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.",N/A,as_expected,2024,380

Our business is affected by varying degrees of technological change and corresponding shifts in customer demand, which result in unpredictable product transitions, shortened life cycles and increased importance of being first to market with new products and services. The development and commercialization of new products ----- and the modification of existing products and services to meet customer demands require a significant investment of resources and an anticipation of the impact of new technologies and the ability to compete with others who may have superior resources in specific technology domains. We may experience difficulties or delays in the research, development, production and/or marketing of new products and services which may negatively impact our operating results and prevent us from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to continue to bring new products and services to market. Further, investment in a product or service could divert our attention and resources from other projects that become more commercially viable in the market. We must anticipate and respond to market and technological changes driven by broader trends such as decarbonization and electrification efforts and the use of low global warming potential refrigerants in response to climate change. Market growth from the use of cleaner energy sources, as well as emissions management, energy efficiency, lower greenhouse gas refrigerant usage, and decarbonization efforts are likely to depend in part on technologies not yet deployed or widely adopted today. We may not adequately innovate or position our business for the adoption of technologies such as battery storage solutions, hydrogen use cases in industry, mobility, and power generation, enhanced electrical grid demand management, carbon capture and sequestration or advanced nuclear power. These trends and the relative competitiveness of our product and service offerings will continue to be impacted by uncertain factors such as the pace of technological developments and related cost considerations, the levels of economic growth in different markets around the world and the adoption of climate change-related policies such as carbon taxes, greenhouse gas emission reductions, incentives or mandates for particular types of energy, or policies that impact the availability of financing for certain types of projects.",N/A,as_expected,2024,380
1525,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.3,"Any failure to obtain, maintain, protect or enforce our intellectual property and other proprietary rights, could harm our competitive position and our business.","Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain, maintain, protect and enforce our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as certain contractual rights, such as confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with employees and third parties, and license and other agreements with consultants, vendors and customers. However, these laws and agreements provide only limited protection and may not be adequate to protect any of our intellectual property rights from being challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed, diluted or misappropriated. Further, efforts to monitor the infringement, misappropriation or other violation of our intellectual property rights by third parties are difficult, expensive, and time-consuming, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevent infringing products from being manufactured without our knowledge and consent. We rely on our trademarks, service marks, trade names and brand names to distinguish our services and solutions from those of our competitors. We have registered or applied to register many of these trademarks, but our trademark applications may not mature to registration or we may not be able to otherwise obtain adequate trademark protection. Also, third parties have brought, and may in the future bring opposition, cancellation or similar adversarial proceedings against our trademark registrations and applications, or otherwise challenge our use of our trademarks. In the event that our trademarks are successfully challenged, we could be forced to rebrand our products, which could result in loss of brand recognition and could require us to devote resources to develop, advertise and market new brands. We have applied for, and may continue to apply for, patents relating to our solutions and technology. The patenting process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to file and/or prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner or pursue or obtain patent protection in all relevant markets. When we do apply for patents, we cannot assure you that our applications will be successful and result in the issuance of any patents or that the scope of the patents that do issue will provide adequate protection from competition. Furthermore, because the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, it is possible that patents issued to us may be challenged successfully and narrowed in scope or found to be invalid or unenforceable in the future. We also rely upon trade secrets and other proprietary information to protect our products and technology, including in cases where intellectual property may not be registrable, or we believe intellectual property is best ----- protected by means that do not require public disclosure. For example, our proprietary scroll machining technology, which we believe is a key component to maintaining a competitive advantage in the scroll compressor market, is primarily protected as a trade secret. However, trade secret protection is risky and uncertain, and the disclosure or independent development of our proprietary technology could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. We seek to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and third parties, as well as through other security measures. However, these agreements and security measures may be inadequate to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information. We cannot guarantee that we have entered into such agreements with every party that has or may have had access to our trade secrets or other proprietary information and, even if entered into, these agreements may be breached or otherwise fail to effectively prevent disclosure of trade secrets or other proprietary information, may be limited as to their term and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure or use of trade secrets or other proprietary information. We have limited control over the protection of trade secrets used by our third-party manufacturers and suppliers and could lose future trade secret protection if any unauthorized disclosure of such information occurs. Further, enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and a favorable outcome is not guaranteed. In addition, if any of our trade secrets or other proprietary information were lawfully obtained or independently developed by a third party, we would not have legal recourse to prevent such third party, or those to whom they communicate such technology or information, from using that technology or information to compete with us. Our intellectual property rights and the enforcement or defense of such rights may be affected by developments or uncertainty in laws and regulations relating to intellectual property rights. Moreover, many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property protection, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement, misappropriation or other violation of our intellectual property or marketing of competing products in violation of our intellectual property rights generally. If we do not obtain sufficient protection for our intellectual property, or if we are unable to effectively maintain, protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitiveness could be impaired, which would limit our growth and future revenue. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,380

Furthermore, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims, and countersuits attacking the validity, scope and enforceability of our intellectual property rights, which could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property. We have in the past, and may in the future, be subject to claims by third parties alleging that we have infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated their intellectual property rights. Furthermore, we cannot guarantee that the operation of our business does not and will not infringe or violate the rights of third parties. Any litigation or proceedings to defend ourselves against allegations of infringement, misappropriation, or other violations of intellectual property rights, regardless of merit, could be costly, divert attention of management and may not ultimately be resolved in our favor. If we are unable to successfully defend against claims that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others, we may be prevented from using certain intellectual property or offering certain products, or may be liable for damages, which in turn could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. We may also be required to acquire or develop an alternative, noninfringing product, which could be costly, time-consuming or impossible, or seek a license from a third party, which may not be available on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.

These activities require favorable environments to execute these transactions, and we may encounter difficulties in obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals in both domestic and foreign jurisdictions.

Such transactions involve numerous other risks, including: - diversion of management time and attention from daily operations; - difficulties integrating or managing acquired businesses, technologies and personnel into our business and cooperating with strategic partners, including doing so without high costs; - difficulties separating divested businesses and potential continued financial involvement in the divested business through transition services arrangements, guarantees, indemnifications or other financial arrangements; - difficulties managing strategic investments; - difficulties in obtaining and verifying the financial statements and other business and other due diligence information of acquired businesses; - inability to obtain required regulatory approvals and/or required financing on favorable terms; - potential loss of key employees, key contractual relationships or key customers of either acquired businesses or our business; - inability to verify ownership of the intellectual property of the acquired businesses and difficulties associated with the ownership of intellectual property such as dependence on licenses from third parties, potential infringement upon intellectual property rights of others or expected acceptance of the technology in the marketplace; - assumption of the liabilities and exposure to unforeseen or undisclosed liabilities of acquired businesses and exposure to regulatory sanctions; - inheriting internal control deficiencies; and - in the case of joint ventures and other investments, partnerships or alliances, interests that diverge from those of our partners without the ability to direct the management and operations of the joint venture or investment in the manner we believe most appropriate to achieve the expected value.

We seek multiple sources of supply for each of our major requirements in order to avoid significant dependence on any one or a few suppliers. However, the availability and prices for raw materials, parts and components may be subject to curtailment or change due to, among other things, suppliers’ allocation to other purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers, changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels. In addition, our facilities, supply chains, distribution systems and products may be impacted by natural or man-made disruptions, including armed conflict, damaging weather or other acts of nature, pandemics or other public health crises or other events. A shutdown of, or inability to utilize, one or more of our facilities, our supply chain or our distribution system could significantly disrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, damage our relationships and reputation with customers, suppliers, employees and others, result in lost sales, result in the misappropriation or corruption of data, or result in legal exposure and large remediation or other expenses. Significant shortages or price increases therefore could impact the prices we charge, our operating costs and the competitive position of our products and services, which could adversely affect our results of operations.

Their skills, experience and industry knowledge significantly benefit our operations and performance. We have experienced, and could continue to experience, high employee turnover and absenteeism, particularly in manufacturing and distribution locations, as a result of COVID-19 related concerns and other factors. A number of factors may adversely affect the labor force available or increase labor costs, including high employment levels, related competition, and federal unemployment subsidies, such as unemployment benefits offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Some of our operations are in sparsely populated, largely rural and agricultural areas that have experienced, and continue to experience, population decline. Sustained population decline in these areas could lead to increased costs, such as increased compensation expense to attract and retain qualified employees. These concerns have decreased the pool of available qualified talent for certain functions. The failure to attract, develop and retain highly qualified personnel could adversely affect our ability to succeed in our human capital goals and priorities as well as negatively impact our business and operating results. In April 2024, the Federal Trade Commission issued a final rule that would prevent employers from entering into non-competes with employees after the effective date of the final rule (presently September 4, 2024) and would invalidate existing non-competes for all but the most senior executives. The final rule is subject to legal challenge and a motion to stay the effective date of the final rule during the pendency of the legal challenge will be decided by July 3, 2024. Consequently, this rule could negatively impact our ability to enforce post-termination non-compete clauses in existing agreements and would prevent the entering into such post-employment restrictions going forward. If a non-compete agreement is challenged and/or found to be unenforceable, we may be unable to prevent the formerly employed employee from competing with us, potentially resulting in the loss of some of our business. In addition, as of September 30, 2023, approximately 9% of our workforce in the U.S. and 29% in international locations were represented by an employee representative organization, such as a union, works council or employee association.

Our U.S. and international operations subject us to changes in government regulations and policies in a large number of jurisdictions around the world, including those related to trade, investments, taxation, exchange controls and repatriation of earnings. Risks related to international operations include exchange control regulations, wage and price controls, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, antitrust regulations, employment regulations, foreign investment laws, import, export and other trade restrictions (such as sanctions and embargoes), differing levels of protection of intellectual property, taxation, regulations and policies related to repatriation of earnings, acts of industrial espionage, violations by our employees of anti-corruption laws (despite our efforts to mitigate such risk), changes in regulations regarding transactions with state-owned enterprises, nationalization of private enterprises, acts of terrorism, acts of war, civil strife, and our ability to hire and maintain qualified staff and maintain the safety of our employees in these regions. Instability and uncertainties arising from the global geopolitical environment and the evolving international and domestic political, regulatory, and economic landscape, including the potential for changes in global trade policies, such as sanctions and trade barriers, and trends such as populism, economic nationalism and negative sentiment toward multinational companies, as well as the cost of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations worldwide, can impair our flexibility in modifying product, marketing, pricing, or other strategies for growing our business, as well as our ability to improve productivity and maintain acceptable operating margins. Changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade, trade restrictions or barriers, tariffs or taxes, trade protection measures, and retaliatory countermeasures, including on imports from countries where we manufacture products, could adversely impact our business and financial results. In addition, changes in the relative values of currencies occur from time to time and have affected our operating results and could do so in the future. In addition, a geopolitical conflict in a region where we operate could disrupt our ability to conduct business operations in that region. Beyond tariffs and sanctions, countries also could adopt other measures, such as controls on imports or exports of goods, technology, or data, which could adversely affect our operations and supply chain and limit our ability to offer our products and services as intended. These kinds of restrictions could be adopted with little to no advanced notice, and we may not be able to effectively mitigate the adverse impacts from such measures. Political uncertainty surrounding trade or other international disputes also could have a negative impact on customer confidence and willingness to spend money, which could impair our future growth. Operating outside the U.S. also exposes us to additional intellectual property risk. The laws and enforcement practices of certain jurisdictions in which we operate may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as in the U.S. and may impose joint venture, technology transfer, local service or other foreign investment requirements, and restrictions that potentially compromise control over our technology and proprietary information. Failure of foreign jurisdictions to protect our intellectual property rights, an inability to effectively enforce such rights in foreign jurisdictions, or the imposition of foreign jurisdiction investment or sourcing restrictions or requirements could result in loss of valuable proprietary information and could impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2024,380

Governments including the U.S., United Kingdom, and those of the EU have imposed export controls on certain products and financial and economic sanctions on certain industry sectors and parties in Russia which has triggered retaliatory sanctions by the Russian government and its allies. The outcome and future impacts of the conflict remain highly uncertain, continue to evolve and may grow more severe the longer the military action and sanctions remain in effect. Risks associated with the Russian-Ukrainian conflict include, but are not limited to, adverse effects on political developments and on general economic conditions, including inflation and consumer spending; disruptions to our supply chains; disruptions to our information systems, including through network failures, malicious or disruptive software, or cybersecurity incidents; trade disruptions; energy shortages or rationing that may adversely impact our manufacturing facilities and consumer spending, particularly in Europe; rising fuel and/or other costs of producing, procuring and shipping our products; our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; and constraints, volatility or disruption in the financial markets. When Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, we immediately began evaluating the legality of and risks associated with continued business with Russia and Belarus versus our contractual commitments to customers in those countries and our desire to continue supporting our employees within Russia. On May 9, 2022 we made the decision to stop accepting new orders from Russia and Belarus, but continued fulfilling already accepted orders where we were legally permitted to do so. We also began the process of disposing of our business operations in Russia. As of March 14, 2023, we stopped fulfilling any remaining open orders with Russia and Belarus and have now exited all business activity within these markets. To date, the Russia-Ukraine conflict has not had a material adverse effect on our business or financial performance. In addition, since October 7, 2023, the hostilities in Israel and the Gaza Strip have further heightened global tensions and instability. At this time, it is unknown whether hostilities in this region will escalate into an even larger conflict. A prolonged war or an escalation of the current conditions in Israel could bring about adverse effects on political developments and on general economic conditions, including inflation and consumer spending and disruptions to our supply chains, which could in turn adversely affect our business operations and financial performance.

In the future, similar changes could adversely impact overall sales, operating results (including potential impairment charges for goodwill or other long-lived assets) and cash flows. Moreover, during economic downturns we may undertake more extensive restructuring actions, including workforce reductions, global facility optimizations, centralization of certain business support activities, and other cost reduction initiatives, and incur higher costs. As these plans and actions can be complex, the anticipated operational improvements, efficiencies and other benefits might be delayed or not realized. Our business and financial performance is also adversely affected by decreases in the general level of economic activity, including decreases in performance of the construction industry in the U.S., Europe and worldwide. For example, construction and other capital investment projects are heavily dependent on general economic conditions, localized demand for real estate and availability of credit, public funding or other sources of financing. Some of the real estate markets we serve are prone to significant fluctuations in supply and demand. For example, our sales in the residential and commercial new construction markets correlate to the number of new homes and buildings that are built, which in turn is influenced by cyclical factors such as interest rates, inflation, availability of financing, consumer spending habits and confidence, employment rates and other macroeconomic ----- factors over which we have no control. Our sales may not improve, or improvement may be limited or lower than expected. In addition, our financial performance may be influenced by the production and utilization of transport equipment, including tractor-trailer and shipping container production cycles in North America and Europe. Recent developments affecting the financial services industry and the resulting market volatility could also have an adverse impact on our business. The recent interest rate increases by the U.S. Federal Reserve (the “Federal Reserve”) have contributed to significant market volatility and the Federal Reserve has signaled that there will likely be additional interest rate increases. The recent and anticipated increases are in response to inflation rising at a rate not seen in decades. This rising rate environment and the speed with which it is anticipated to be implemented could materially affect our results of operations. Additionally, during the course of 2023, Silicon Valley Bank (“SVB”) failed and was taken into receivership by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; Signature Bank and Silvergate Capital Corp. (“Silvergate”) were each swept into receivership; a syndicate of U.S. banks infused $30 billion in First Republic Bank; and it was announced that UBS Group AG would be acquiring Credit Suisse Group AG (“Credit Suisse”), with support from the government of Switzerland, following the deterioration of the financial condition of Credit Suisse, all in an attempt to reassure depositors and calm fears of a banking contagion. Although we do not hold any cash or maintain any accounts at, nor do we have any other relationships with SVB, Signature Bank or Silvergate, if other banks and financial institutions enter receivership or become insolvent in the future in response to financial conditions affecting the banking system and financial markets, our ability to access our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments may be threatened, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2024,380

We continue to monitor and review new guidance and regulations as they are issued, as any changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements. In addition, governmental authorities are actively engaged in formulating new legislative proposals. Any future legislative changes to the tax laws and judicial or regulatory interpretation thereof, the geographic mix of earnings, changes in overall profitability, and other factors could also materially impact our effective tax rate. Effective with the Transactions, substantially all U.S. operations are owned by an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. tax purposes, which generally is not subject to U.S. income tax. This results in an effective tax rate for the Successor period that is significantly lower than the Predecessor periods, because in such prior periods the U.S. operations were owned by an entity treated as a corporation for U.S. tax purposes, and thus were subject to U.S. income tax. If the Company’s structure were to change in the future, this could have a material impact on entity level taxes. We continue to monitor for other tax changes, U.S. (including state and local) and non-U.S. related, which can also adversely impact our overall tax burden. From time to time, proposals have been made and/or legislation has been introduced to change the tax laws, regulations or interpretations thereof of various jurisdictions or limit tax treaty benefits that if enacted or implemented could materially increase our tax burden and/or effective tax rate and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has released proposals to create an agreed set of international rules for fighting base erosion and profit shifting, including Pillar One and Pillar Two, such that tax laws in countries in which we do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis, and any such changes could adversely impact us. On December 12, 2022, the EU member states agreed in principle on the introduction of a global minimum tax rate (proposed at 15%). On December 15, 2022, the European Council formally adopted the Council Directive on ensuring a global minimum level of taxation for multinational and large-scale domestic groups in the EU member states (the “Directive”), meaning that the Directive was transposed into EU member states’ national law by the end of 2023, entering into effect beginning January 1, 2024. As a consequence, our global effective tax rate could be materially impacted by such legislation, or any resulting local country legislation enacted in response to any potential global minimum tax rates. In addition to the above, the European Commission has been very active in investigating whether various tax regimes or private tax rulings provided by a country to particular taxpayers may constitute state aid. We cannot predict the outcome of any of these potential changes or investigations in any of the jurisdictions, but if any of the above occurs and impacts us, this could materially increase our tax burden and/or effective tax rate and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. While we monitor proposals and other developments that would materially impact our tax burden and/or effective tax rate and investigate our options, we could still be subject to increased taxation on a going forward basis no matter what action we undertake if certain legislative proposals or regulatory changes are enacted, certain tax ----- treaties are amended and/or our interpretation of applicable tax or other laws is challenged and determined to be incorrect. In addition, our tax returns are subject to regular review and audit by U.S. and non-U.S. tax authorities. These examinations on their own, or any subsequent litigation related to the examinations, may result in additional taxes or penalties against us. While we believe our tax provisions are appropriate, the final outcome of tax audits or disputes could result in adjustments to our tax liabilities, which could adversely affect our financial results.",N/A,as_expected,2024,380

In particular, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010 and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced government corruption to some degree. We cannot provide assurance that our training and internal controls will always protect us from the improper conduct of our employees, agents and business partners. Any such violation of law or improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, could lead to substantial civil or criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and related shareholder lawsuits, could lead to increased costs of compliance and could damage our reputation, our business and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,380
1525,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.25,"Climate change, regulations associated with climate change, and climate change mitigation efforts could adversely affect our business.","The effects of climate change, including increased frequency and intensity of weather conditions and water scarcity, create financial risks to our business. The potential impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain and depend upon the unique geographic and environmental factors present, such as rising sea levels at certain of our facilities, changing storm patterns and intensities and changing temperature levels. The effects of climate change could also disrupt our operations by impacting the availability and cost of materials and by increasing insurance, energy and other operating costs. The effects of climate change also may impact our decisions to construct new facilities or maintain existing facilities in the areas most prone to physical risks, which could similarly increase our operating and material costs. We could also face indirect financial risks passed through the supply chain that could result in higher prices for our products and the resources needed to produce them, or which we may not be able to pass on to customers through increases in prices for our products. Potential adverse impacts from climate change may create health and safety issues for employees operating at our facilities and may lead to an inability to maintain standard operating hours. In addition, increased public awareness and concern regarding global climate change may result in more international, federal, and/or state or other stakeholder requirements or expectations that could result in more restrictive or expansive requirements or standards, such as stricter limits on greenhouse gas emissions or more prescriptive reporting or disclosure of greenhouse gas emissions or other environmental, social, and governance metrics. There continues to be a lack of consistent climate change legislation and standards, which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty and may result in operational or other inefficiencies. While we have adopted certain voluntary targets, laws, regulations or standards pertaining to climate change may be adopted, changed or accelerated that impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements on us, our products or our customers, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. There is consensus among the international scientific community that greenhouse gas emissions are the leading cause of human-influenced climate change, and that these emissions must be reduced dramatically to avert its worst effects. Increased public awareness and concern about climate change will likely continue to: (1) generate more international, regional and/or national requirements to curtail the use of high global warming potential refrigerants (e.g., the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol and the American Innovation and Manufacturing Act of 2020), which are essential to many of our products; (2) increase demand for energy efficient HVACR equipment and cold chain solutions, as well as more efficient building energy management; and (3) cause a shift ----- away from the use of fossil fuels as an energy source, including natural gas prohibitions. In some instances, these requirements may render our existing technology (particularly some of our HVACR and refrigeration products) noncompliant or obsolete, and we may be required to make increased capital expenditures to meet new regulations and standards, changing interpretations, and stricter enforcement of current laws and regulations, or to increase spending on research and development for new products. Furthermore, our customers and the markets we serve may impose emissions or other environmental standards through regulation, market-based emissions policies, or consumer requirements or preferences that we may not be able to timely meet due to the required level of capital investment and technology advancement. While we are committed to pursuing environmentally sustainable solutions for our products, there can be no assurance that our development efforts will be successful, that our products will be accepted by the market, that proposed regulations or deregulation will not have an adverse effect on our competitive position, or that economic returns will justify our investments in new product development. The varying and frequently changing international, regional and/or national requirements associated with climate change regulations, including the U.S. re-entrance into the Paris Climate Agreement, also create economic and regulatory uncertainty and may result in operational or other inefficiencies. There is also regulatory and budgetary uncertainty associated with government incentives, which, if discontinued, could adversely impact the demand for energy-efficient buildings and could increase costs of compliance.",N/A,as_expected,2024,380

Environmental laws and regulations are frequently revised and have generally become more stringent over time. Compliance with these laws and regulations is a significant factor in our business. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur expenditures to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with applicable environmental laws, regulations and permit requirements could result in civil or criminal fines or penalties or enforcement actions, including regulatory or judicial orders suspending or enjoining operations or requiring corrective measures, installation of pollution control equipment, or remedial actions. We are currently, and may in the future be, required to incur costs relating to the investigation or remediation of the environmental condition of property (including current and former manufacturing sites and properties and third-party sites, where wastes generated by our operations, or those of our predecessors have been disposed of), and for addressing environmental conditions, as well as for associated liabilities, including liabilities for natural resource damages, third party property damage or personal injury. Some environmental laws and regulations, including the U.S. Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, (“CERCLA”), and comparable state statutes, impose liability and responsibility on present and former owners, operators or users of facilities and sites for contamination at such facilities and sites without regard to fault or the causation or knowledge of, or the legality of the conduct that contributed to, contamination. Liability under CERCLA is retroactive, and, under certain circumstances, liability for the entire cost of a cleanup can be imposed on any responsible party. Environmental conditions relating to our former, current or future sites, or those of predecessor companies whose liabilities we may have retained, assumed or acquired, have resulted in and may, in the future, result in additional obligations to undertake investigation, remediation or monitoring activities that could cause us to incur significant future costs and expenditures and become subject to unanticipated claims or liabilities. At facilities with past or ongoing remedial actions, we may incur additional liabilities related to discovery of previously undetected contamination or resulting from the promulgation of new or more stringent cleanup standards (including for so-called “emerging contaminants”). ----- In addition, business decisions related to our facilities, including consolidations, expansions, dispositions or closures, may require environmental investigations that have resulted in and may, in the future, lead to discoveries of contamination or trigger compliance requirements. We cannot assure you that existing or future circumstances, the discovery of new information, or the failure of third parties to address contamination at current or former facilities or properties will not require us to incur significant expenditures in excess of the financial reserves that we have established for our presently anticipated remedial obligations. We may also be subject to increasingly stringent laws and regulations concerning the use, import and export, and content of chemicals and hazardous substances (including, without limitation, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) in our products, including, without limitation, the United States Toxic Substances Control Act, the European Union’s Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemical Substances directive and the Restriction of Hazardous Substances directive, California Proposition 65, and similar or more stringent laws and regulations in other jurisdictions. These product compliance laws and regulations may require, among other things, the testing and registration of substances that are incorporated into, or that form a part of, our products; limit or require us to phase out or eliminate use of certain designated substances; the identification or development of substitute substances or technologies; or impose labelling or warning requirements on our products with respect to certain designated substances. We could also be subject to significant fines or other civil and criminal penalties should we fail to comply with these laws and regulations. There can be no assurance that current or future product compliance laws and regulations will not impose costly requirements upon us or have a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings, financial condition, or competitive position.

Our ability to achieve any new or updated ESG goals and aspirations will be subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are dependent on the collective efforts of others or may be outside of our control. Such risks include, among others, the availability and adoption of new or additional technologies that reduce carbon or eliminate energy sources on a commercially reasonable basis, competing and evolving economic, policy and regulatory factors, the ability of suppliers and others to meet our environmental sustainability, diversity and other goals, the availability of qualified candidates in our labor markets and our ability to recruit and retain diverse talent, and customer engagement with our goals.

The historical information about us in this offering memorandum for the Predecessor Period reflects our business as operated by Emerson and is derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of Emerson. Accordingly, the combined and consolidated financial statements for the Predecessor Period may not reflect our business’ combined results of operations, financial position and cash flows had it been a standalone company during the periods presented and may not be indicative of those that we will achieve following the Transactions. Actual financial results that would have been achieved for the Predecessor Period if our business had been a standalone company would depend on multiple factors, including organizational structure and strategic decisions made in various areas, including information technology and infrastructure, due primarily to the following factors: - our business was historically operated by Emerson as part of its broader corporate organization, rather than as an independent company. Emerson provided resources to us for the performance of various corporate functions such as information technology, tax, accounting, human resources, benefits, legal, compliance, treasury, insurance, finance and other administrative functions. As a result of the separation, our costs related to such functions previously performed by Emerson may increase; - we have entered into agreements for new relationships with Emerson for which there was no counterpart prior to the Transactions and therefore are not reflected in our historical results; - our historical financial information for the Predecessor Period does not reflect changes that we have experienced and expect to continue to experience in the future as a result of the Transactions, including changes in our cost structure, personnel needs, tax structure, financing and business operations. As part of Emerson, we enjoyed certain benefits from its operating diversity, size, purchasing power, our ability to secure favorable terms on our vendor contracts and available capital for investments, and we may lose some of those benefits after the Transactions; - after the completion of the Transactions, the cost of capital for our business is expected to be higher than Emerson’s cost of capital prior to the Transactions; - following the Transactions, we may be more susceptible to economic downturns and other adverse events than if we were still a part of Emerson; and - certain employees who have historically performed services for both our business and for Emerson are no longer employees of our business after the Transactions.

As of March 31, 2024, we had $1,965.5 million of outstanding debt at variable interest rates. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on our variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, would correspondingly decrease. A 0.25% increase in the rate of interest under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $4.9 million based on amounts outstanding as of March 31, 2024, which amount would increase to the extent additional borrowings are made on our Revolving Credit Facility. Additionally, an unfavorable movement in interest rates, primarily the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”), could result in higher interest rate expense and cash payments for us.

The lien securing the notes on the Fixed Asset Priority Collateral will be senior to the lien on such Collateral securing our Revolving Credit Facility and the lien securing the notes on the ABL Priority Collateral will be junior to the lien on such Collateral securing our Revolving Credit Facility.

No appraisal of the value of the Collateral has been made in connection with this offering of the notes, and the fair market value of the Collateral will be subject to fluctuations based on factors that include, among others, changing economic conditions, competition and other future trends. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. In the event of a foreclosure, liquidation, bankruptcy or similar proceeding, the Collateral may not be sold in a timely or orderly manner, and the proceeds from any sale or liquidation of the Collateral may not be sufficient to pay our obligations under the notes, in full or at all, particularly with the proceeds from the ABL Priority Collateral, which will be applied first to satisfying in full our obligations under our Revolving Credit Facility and all other future senior-priority indebtedness that is secured by the ABL Priority Collateral. Moreover, the lenders under the Term Loan Facilities and the holders of any other additional indebtedness secured by a senior-priority lien on the Fixed Asset Priority Collateral will share the proceeds of such Fixed Asset Priority Collateral ratably with the holders of the notes and the Existing Notes, thereby diluting the Fixed Asset Priority Collateral coverage available to holders of the notes. In particular, the fair market value of the Collateral may not be sufficient to repay the holders of the notes upon any foreclosure, liquidation, bankruptcy or similar proceeding and after the repayment of indebtedness with prior security interests in the Collateral, if any. There also can be no assurance that the Collateral will be saleable, and even if saleable, the timing of its liquidation would be uncertain. Accordingly, there may not be sufficient Collateral to pay all or any of the amounts due on the notes. Any claim for the difference between the amount, if any, realized by holders of the notes from the sale of the Collateral securing the notes and the obligations under the notes and other obligations secured by a lien on Collateral will rank equally in right of payment with all of the Issuers’ unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness and other obligations, including trade payables. In addition, as discussed further below, the holders of the notes would not be entitled to receive post-petition interest or applicable fees, costs, expenses, or charges to the extent the amount of the obligations due under the notes exceed the value of the Collateral (after taking into account all other equal priority debt that was also secured by the Collateral, including the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Existing Notes), or any “adequate protection” on account of any undersecured portion of the notes. See “—In the event of a bankruptcy of the Issuers or any of the guarantors, the holders of the notes may be deemed to have an unsecured claim to the extent that the Issuers’ obligations in respect of the notes exceed the fair market value of the Collateral securing the notes and the guarantees.” With respect to some of the Collateral, the security interest of the Notes Collateral Agent and its ability to foreclose will also be limited by the need to meet certain requirements, such as obtaining third-party consents and making additional filings. If the Issuers are unable to obtain these consents or make these filings, the security interests may be invalid and the holders will not be entitled to the Collateral or any recovery with respect thereto. We cannot assure you that any such required consents will be obtained on a timely basis or at all. These requirements may limit the number of potential bidders for certain Collateral in any foreclosure or other auction and may delay any sale, either of which events may have an adverse effect on the sale price of the Collateral. Therefore, the practical value of realizing on the Collateral may, without the appropriate consents and filings, be limited. Under the terms of the indenture that will govern the notes, the Issuers will be permitted to incur indebtedness in amounts in excess of the principal amount of outstanding Existing Notes and the commitments under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities.

The indenture that will govern the notes will also permit the Issuers and the guarantors to create additional liens on the Collateral under specified circumstances, some of which liens may be equal in priority with or senior to the liens securing the notes.

Applicable law requires that a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be properly perfected and its priority retained through certain actions undertaken by the secured party. The liens on the Collateral securing the notes may not be perfected if we are not able to take the actions necessary to perfect any of these liens on or prior to the date of the issuance of the notes or thereafter. We will have limited obligations to perfect the security interest of the holders of the notes in specified collateral other than the filing of financing statements. To the extent a security interest in certain Collateral is not properly perfected on the date of the issuance of the notes, such security interest might be avoidable in bankruptcy, which could impact the value of the Collateral. See “—Any future pledge of Collateral or guarantee may be avoidable in bankruptcy.” If additional material wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries are formed or acquired and become guarantors under the indenture that will govern the notes, additional financing statements would be required to be filed to perfect the security interest for the notes in the assets of such guarantors. Depending on the type of the assets constituting after-acquired collateral, additional action may be required to perfect the security interest in such assets. Applicable law requires that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest can be perfected only at the time such property and rights are acquired and identified. Neither the trustee for the notes nor the Notes Collateral Agent will be responsible to monitor, and there can be no assurance that the Issuers will inform the trustee for the notes or the Notes Collateral Agent of, the future acquisition of property and rights that constitute Collateral, and that the necessary action will be taken to properly perfect the security interest in such after-acquired collateral. None of the trustee for the notes, the Notes Collateral Agent, the Existing Notes Collateral Agent or the collateral agent for the Senior Secured Credit Facilities will have any obligation to monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights that constitute Collateral or monitor the perfection of or make any filings to perfect or maintain the perfection of any security interests therein. Such inaction may result in the loss of the security interest in such Collateral or the priority of the security interest in favor of the notes and the guarantees against third parties. Even if the Notes Collateral Agent’s liens on Collateral acquired or arising in the future are properly perfected, such liens may potentially be avoidable as a preference in any bankruptcy proceeding under certain circumstances.

While the relevant laws may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, the incurrence of the obligations in respect of the notes and the guarantees and, in the case of the notes and the guarantees, the grant of liens will generally be a fraudulent conveyance if (i) the transactions relating to the issuance of the notes or guarantees or, in the case of the notes and the guarantees, the grant of liens were undertaken with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding other creditors or (ii) the Issuers or any of the guarantors, as applicable, received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration in return for issuing either the notes or a guarantee or, in the case of the notes and the guarantees, the granting of liens and, in the case of (ii) only, any one of the following is also true: - the Issuers or any of the guarantors was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of issuing the notes or the guarantees (or the related security interests with respect to the notes and the guarantees); ----- - the issuance of the notes or guarantees (or the related security interests with respect to the notes and the guarantees) left the Issuers or any of the guarantors with an unreasonably small amount of capital to carry on the business in which such Issuers or such guarantor was engaged or about to engage; or - the Issuers or any of the guarantors intended to, or believed that we or it would, incur debts beyond our or its ability to pay as they become due. If a court were to find that the issuance of the notes or a guarantee or, in the case of the notes and the guarantees, the grant of liens was a fraudulent conveyance, the court could void the payment obligations under the notes or such guarantee or further subordinate the notes or such guarantee to presently existing and future indebtedness of such Issuer or such guarantor, or require the holders of the notes to repay any amounts received with respect to the notes or such guarantee or, in the case of the notes and the guarantees, void the granting of liens to secure the notes or the guarantees. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent conveyance occurred, you may not receive any repayment on the notes. Further, the voidance of the notes could result in an event of default with respect to our other debt and that of the guarantors that could result in acceleration of such debt. The measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent conveyance laws vary depending upon the law of the jurisdiction that is being applied, such that we cannot be certain as to: the standards a court would use to determine whether or not the Issuers or the guarantors were solvent at the relevant time, or, regardless of the standard that a court uses, that it would not determine that the Issuers or a guarantor was indeed insolvent on that date; that any payments to the holders of the notes (including under the guarantees) did not constitute preferences, fraudulent transfers or conveyances on other grounds; or that the issuance of the notes and the guarantees would not be subordinated to the Issuers’ or any guarantor’s other debt. Generally, an entity would be considered insolvent if, at the time it incurred indebtedness: - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair value of all its assets; - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts and liabilities, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or - it could not pay its debts as they become due. As a general matter, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or obligation, property is transferred or a valid antecedent debt is satisfied. A court would likely find that the Issuers or a guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the notes or such guarantee and/or lien if the Issuers or such guarantor did not substantially benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the notes or the applicable guarantee and/or lien. Thus, if the guarantees were legally challenged, any guarantee could be subject to the claim that, since the guarantee was incurred for the Issuers’ benefit, and only indirectly for the benefit of the guarantor, the obligations of the applicable guarantor were incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration. Therefore, a court could void the obligations under the guarantees (and any related liens in the case of the notes), subordinate them to the applicable guarantor’s other debt or take other action detrimental to the holders of the notes. To the extent a court avoids any of the guarantees as fraudulent transfers or holds any of the guarantees unenforceable for any other reason, (x) the holders of notes would cease to have any direct claim against the applicable guarantor or (y) in the case of liens granted to secure the notes or the guarantees, the holders of notes would cease to have a secured claim against the Issuers or the guarantors, as applicable. If a court were to take this action, the applicable guarantor’s assets would be applied first to satisfy the applicable guarantor’s other liabilities, if any, and might not be applied to the payment of the guarantee. Sufficient funds to repay the notes may not be available from other sources, including the remaining guarantors, if any. In addition, the court might direct you to repay any amounts that you already received from the Issuers or the applicable guarantor. ----- Although each guarantee entered into in connection with the notes will contain a provision intended to limit that guarantor’s liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its guarantee to be a fraudulent transfer, this provision may not be effective as a legal matter to protect those guarantees from being avoided under fraudulent transfer law or otherwise, or may reduce that guarantor’s obligation to an amount that effectively makes its guarantee worthless. In addition, as noted above, any payment by the Issuers pursuant to the notes or by a guarantor under a guarantee made at a time such Issuers or such guarantor was found to be insolvent could be voided and required to be returned to the Issuers or such guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the Issuers’ or such guarantor’s creditors if such payment is made to an insider within a one-year period prior to a bankruptcy filing or within 90 days for any outside party and such payment would give such insider or outsider party more than such creditors would have received in a distribution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in a hypothetical Chapter 7 case. Finally, as a court of equity, the bankruptcy court may otherwise subordinate the claims in respect of the notes or the guarantees to other claims against the Issuers or the guarantors under the principle of equitable subordination, if the court determines that: (i) the holder of the notes engaged in some type of inequitable conduct; (ii) such inequitable conduct resulted in injury to our other creditors or conferred an unfair advantage upon the holder of the notes; and (iii) equitable subordination is not inconsistent with the provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.",N/A,as_expected,2024,380

Any future pledge of Collateral or issuance of a guarantee in favor of the holders of the notes (including any Liens delivered or reinstated after the Reversion Date (as defined under the heading “Description of Notes”), and/or pursuant to guarantees delivered in connection therewith after the date the notes are issued) may be avoidable by the pledgor (as a debtor in possession), guarantor (as a debtor in possession), by its trustee in bankruptcy or potentially by other creditors if certain events or circumstances exist or occur, including, among others, if (1) the pledgor or guarantor is insolvent at the time of the pledge and/or issuance of the guarantee, (2) the pledge and/or issuance of the guarantee (as applicable) permits the holders of the notes to receive a greater recovery in a hypothetical Chapter 7 case than if such pledge and/or guarantee (as applicable) had not been given and (3) a bankruptcy proceeding in respect of the pledgor or guarantor is commenced within 90 days following the pledge or the perfection thereof and/or the issuance of the guarantee (as applicable), or, in certain circumstances, a longer period.

Under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, a secured creditor, such as the Notes Collateral Agent, is prohibited from foreclosing upon or repossessing its security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from disposing of security previously repossessed from a debtor, without prior bankruptcy court approval (which may not be given under the circumstances). Moreover, bankruptcy law permits the debtor to continue to retain and use collateral, and the proceeds, products, rents or profits of the collateral, even though the debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments, provided that the secured creditor is given “adequate protection.” The meaning of the term “adequate protection” may vary according to the circumstances, but it is intended in general to protect the value of the secured ----- creditor’s interest in its collateral and may include cash payments or the granting of additional or replacement security, if and at such time as the court in its discretion determines, for any diminution in the value of the collateral as a result of the automatic stay of repossession or disposition or any use of the collateral by the debtor during the pendency of the bankruptcy case. A bankruptcy court may determine that a secured creditor may not require compensation for a diminution in the value of its collateral if the value of the collateral exceeds the debt it secures. In view of both the lack of a precise definition of the term “adequate protection” under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and the broad discretionary powers of a bankruptcy court, it is impossible to predict how, whether or when payments under the notes could be made following the commencement of a bankruptcy case, the length of the delay in making any such payments or whether any such payment will be made at all or in what form, whether or when the Notes Collateral Agent could or would repossess or dispose of the Collateral, the value of the Collateral as of the commencement date of any bankruptcy proceedings, or whether or to what extent or in what form holders of the notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of the value of the Collateral through the requirements of “adequate protection.”",N/A,as_expected,2024,380

In addition, as noted above, the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement and the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, as applicable, will prohibit the trustee for the notes and the Notes Collateral Agent from objecting following the filing of a bankruptcy petition to proposed debtor-in-possession financing to be provided to us that is secured by the Fixed Asset Priority Collateral or by the ABL Priority Collateral, as applicable, or to the use of cash collateral that has not been opposed to or objected to by the controlling collateral agent or the other controlling secured parties, subject to certain conditions and limited exceptions.

Upon a finding by the bankruptcy court that the notes are under-collateralized, the claims in the bankruptcy proceeding with respect to the notes would be bifurcated between a secured claim and an unsecured claim, and the unsecured claim would not be entitled to the benefits of security in the Collateral. In such event, the secured claims of the holders of the notes would be limited to the value of the Collateral. The consequences of a finding of under-collateralization would include, among other things, a lack of entitlement on the part of the holders of the notes to receive post-petition interest, fees, and expenses and a lack of entitlement on the part of the unsecured portion of the notes to receive “adequate protection” under federal bankruptcy laws, as discussed above. In addition, if any payments of post-petition interest had been made at the time of such a finding of under-collateralization, those payments could be re-characterized by the bankruptcy court as a reduction of the principal amount of the secured claim with respect to the notes. ----- - If a bankruptcy petition were filed by or against us in the United States, the allowed claim for the notes may be less than the principal amount of the notes stated in the indenture. - If a bankruptcy petition were filed by or against us under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code after the issuance of the notes, the claim by any holder of the notes for the principal amount thereof may be allowed in an amount equal to the sum of: - the original issue price of the notes; and - that portion of the stated principal amount of the notes that exceeds the issue price thereof, if any, that does not constitute “unmatured interest” for the purposes of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

However, on May 19, 2023, Emerald Debt Merger Sub L.L.C (“Merger Sub”), a subsidiary of Emerald JV Holdings, L.P., which was merged with and into EMRLD Borrower LP (“EMRLD Borrower”) on the consummation of the Acquisition, and Emerald Co-Issuer Inc., a direct subsidiary of EMRLD Borrower, issued senior secured notes in the aggregate principal amount of $2,275.0 million and aggregate principal amount of €455.0 million (or $500.0 million U.S. dollar equivalent, based on the exchange rate of approximately $1.10 per €1.00), (the “Original Dollar Notes” and the “Original Euro Notes”, respectively, and collectively the “Initial Notes”). The Company incurred $6.2 million of interest expense for the period from May 19, 2023, to May 31, 2023, related to the Initial Notes, which has been recognized in the Successor Period. In addition to the Initial Notes, in connection with the Acquisition, on May 31, 2023, EMRLD Borrower entered into a 5-year senior secured term loan facility in an original aggregate principal amount of $450.0 million (the “Term Loan A Facility”) and a 7-year senior secured term loan facility in an original aggregate principal amount of $2,275.0 million (the “Original Term Loan B Facility” and, together with the Term Loan A Facility, the “Term Loan Facilities”), and a 5-year senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $700.0 million (the “Revolving Credit Facility” and, together with the Term Loan Facilities, the “Senior Secured Credit Facilities”). As of March 31, 2024, the Company has $399.5 million of borrowing availability under the Revolving Credit Facility subject to borrowing base capacity (including borrowing base capacity in foreign jurisdictions after giving effect to approximately $9.1 million of letters of credit expected to be outstanding thereunder), in each case, before giving effect to financing costs. Further, EMRLD Seller Notes Issuer L.P., an entity owned by the Company, issued two senior unsecured notes to subsidiaries of Emerson in the aggregate amount of $2,250.0 million (the “Seller Notes”). The borrowers/issuers under the Term Loan Facilities, the Initial Notes, Revolving Credit Facility, and the Seller Notes (collectively, the “Financing Transactions” and, together with the Acquisition, the “Transactions”) are wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company. Accordingly, in periods after the Acquisition, we have recorded an increase in interest expense. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,380

The Refinanced Term Loan B Facility has identical terms to the Original Term Loan B Facility provided, however, that (a) borrowings under the Refinanced Term Loan B Facility bear interest at the Term SOFR Rate plus a margin of between 2.25% and 2.50% per annum (based on EMRLD Borrower’s first lien net leverage ratio), subject to a Term SOFR Rate floor of 0.00% and (b) any voluntary prepayment, refinancing or repricing of the term loans under the Refinanced Term Loan B Facility in connection with certain repricing transactions that occur on or prior to the six-month anniversary of the closing of the Refinanced Term Loan B Facility are subject to a prepayment premium of 1.00% of the principal amount of such term loans so prepaid, refinanced or repriced, subject to certain exceptions. In connection with the Refinanced Term Loan B Facility, on February 6, 2024, the Company issued new senior secured notes in the aggregate principal amount of $750.0 million, including $500.0 million of Dollar Notes (the “New Dollar Notes”) and €230.0 (or $250.0 million U.S. dollar equivalent, based on the exchange rate of approximately $1.09 per €1.00) of Euro Notes (the “New Euro Notes” and, collectively with the New Dollar Notes, the “New Notes”). The proceeds of the Refinanced Term Loan B Facility, together with the proceeds of the New Notes and cash on hand were used to refinance all of the Original Term Loan B Facility and to pay fees, costs and expenses related to the offering of the New Notes and the Refinanced Term Loan B Facility. The New Dollar Notes were issued at a premium of 100.750, resulting in a premium of $3.8 million. The New Euro Notes were issued at a premium of 104.250, resulting in a USD premium of approximately $10.6 million. The New Notes have the same terms as the Initial Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2024,380
1525,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.4,Comparability of Historical Financial Results,17.4.3,Separation from Emerson and operating as a standalone company,"Following the Acquisition, Copeland is a standalone company with independent functions and operations. However, prior to the Acquisition and Financing Transactions, see “—Comparability of Historical Financial Results—The Acquisition and Financing Transactions,” the Climate Technologies Business historically operated as part of Emerson and not as a standalone entity. The Predecessor period of each of the (i) consolidated and combined financial statements and (ii) unaudited condensed, consolidated and combined financial statements and this section present the historical financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Climate Technologies Business as if it had operated on a standalone basis subject to Emerson’s control and include all accounts of the Climate Technologies Business and its subsidiaries and affiliates on a consolidated basis. Intercompany transactions, profits and balances among Climate Technologies Business entities have been eliminated in consolidation and combination. The Predecessor period of each of the (i) consolidated and combined financial statements and (ii) unaudited condensed, consolidated and combined financial statements were derived from Emerson’s financial statements and accounting records and have been prepared in conformity with GAAP. Sale and purchase transactions between the Climate Technologies Business and other Emerson affiliates are included in the unaudited condensed and consolidated financial statements for the six months ended March 31, 2024 (Successor), the audited condensed and consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2023 (Successor) and for the four months ended September 30, 2023 (Successor), the consolidated and combined financial statements as of September 30, 2022 (Predecessor) and for the eight months ended May 31, 2023 (Predecessor) and the year ended September 30, 2022 (Predecessor), as well as the unaudited condensed, consolidated and combined financial statements for the six months ended March 31, 2023 (Predecessor). As a business of Emerson, the Climate Technologies Business was charged for costs directly related to its business and was allocated a portion of Emerson’s general corporate costs. All of these costs were reflected in the Predecessor period of the each of the (i) consolidated and combined financial statements and (ii) unaudited condensed, consolidated and combined financial statements. The Climate Technologies Business participated in various Emerson programs which included information technology services, employee benefits, medical insurance and other programs. Costs associated with these programs were charged to the Climate Technologies Business based on Emerson’s actual cost and the Climate Technologies Business’ relative level of usage. Emerson provided certain oversight and support services, including assistance with management strategy, logistics, marketing, finance, treasury, insurance, tax, human resources, legal, compliance and other activities. A charge for these services and royalties was allocated to the Climate Technologies Business based principally on ----- revenue. While management believes the methodologies and assumptions used to allocate these costs are reasonable, each of the (i) consolidated and combined financial statements and (ii) unaudited condensed, consolidated and combined financial statements for the Predecessor periods do not purport to represent the financial position, or the results of operations, changes in equity, and cash flows of the Climate Technologies Business as a standalone entity, or what they would have been had the Climate Technologies Business operated as a standalone entity during the periods presented. Income tax expense was recorded as if the Climate Technologies Business filed tax returns on a stand-alone basis separate from Emerson. This separate return methodology applies the accounting guidance for income taxes to the consolidated and combined carve-out financial statements as if the Climate Technologies Business was a standalone enterprise for the periods presented. Our operating results were included in Emerson’s consolidated U.S. federal and state income tax returns or non-U.S. jurisdiction tax returns. The calculation of the Climate Technologies Business’ income taxes involved considerable judgment and the use of both estimates and allocations that affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expenses. Therefore, the tax liabilities and deferred taxes included in each of the (i) unaudited condensed, consolidated and combined financial statements as of March 31, 2023 (Predecessor) and for the six months ended March 31, 2023 (Predecessor) and (ii) consolidated and combined financial statements as of September 30, 2022 (Predecessor) and the eight months ended May 31, 2023 (Predecessor) and the year ended September 30, 2022 (Predecessor) may not be reflective of our actual tax balances that were included in Emerson’s consolidated filings prior to the carve-out.",N/A,as_expected,2024,380

Our sales in the residential and commercial new construction markets correlate to the number of new homes and buildings that are built, which in turn is influenced by cyclical factors such as interest rates, inflation, availability of financing, consumer spending habits and confidence, employment rates and other macroeconomic factors over which we have no control. Significant components of our operating expenses vary directly as we experience a heightened pace of inflation, and we seek to dynamically manage our cost structure using price actions with our customers in response to such changes. Given a portion of our revenue is tied to a contractual lookback provision with respect to price actions, there is a timing lag in our ability to recover increased costs under those contracts during periods of rapid inflation. The contract lag and inability to increase prices real-time to offset increased costs and inflationary pressures, or otherwise mitigate the impact of these macroeconomic conditions and market disruptions on our business, may increase our costs of doing business and reduce our margins in any given period.",N/A,as_expected,2024,380

Adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA as further adjusted to exclude certain items that impact the comparison of the performance of our businesses either period-over-period or with other businesses as more fully described below. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales for the respective period. Standalone Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA further adjusted for standalone costs. We define Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA as Standalone Adjusted EBITDA further adjusted for the estimated normalized “run-rate” benefit from pricing actions and cost saving initiatives that are expected to be realized by the end of fiscal 2026. Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA margin is calculated as Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales for the respective period.

We present EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Standalone Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Margin because we believe they assist investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance, and we believe that these metrics provide useful information to investors in understanding and evaluating our operating results. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Standalone Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Margin do not reflect certain cash expenses that we are obligated to make, and although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Standalone Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Margin do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements.

A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to a customer. Revenue is recognized when, or as performance obligations are satisfied, and control has transferred to the customer, typically when products are shipped or delivered, title and risk of loss pass to the customer, and the Company has a present right to payment. The vast majority of the Company’s revenues are performance obligations related to the sale of manufactured products which are recognized at a point in time when control transfers in accordance with shipping terms. In limited circumstances, contracts include multiple performance obligations, where revenue is recognized separately for each good or service, as well as contracts where revenue is recognized over time as control transfers to the customer. For revenues recognized over time, the Company typically uses an input method to determine progress and recognize revenue, based on costs incurred. The Company believes costs incurred closely correspond with its performance under the contract and the transfer of control to the customer. In sales arrangements that involve multiple performance obligations, revenue is allocated based on the relative standalone selling price for each performance obligation. Observable selling prices from actual transactions are used whenever possible. In other instances, the Company determines the standalone selling price based on thirdparty pricing or management’s best estimate. Payment terms vary but are generally short-term in nature. The Company’s long-term contracts, where revenue is generally recognized over time, are billed as work progresses in accordance with the contract terms and conditions, either at periodic intervals or upon achievement of certain milestones. The timing of revenue recognition and billings under these contracts results in either unbilled receivables (contract assets) when revenue recognized exceeds billings, or customer advances (contract liabilities) when billings exceed revenue recognized. Unbilled receivables are reclassified to accounts receivable when an unconditional right to consideration exists, typically when a milestone in the contract is achieved. The Company does not evaluate whether the transaction price includes a significant financing component for contracts where the time between cash collection and performance is less than one year. Certain arrangements with customers include variable consideration, typically in the form of rebates, cash discounts or penalties. Other than standard product warranty provisions, sales arrangements provide no other post shipment obligations on the Company. In most instances, returns are limited to product quality issues. The Company records a reduction to revenue at the time of sale to reflect the ultimate amount of consideration it expects to receive. The Company’s estimates are updated quarterly based on historical experience, trend analysis, and expected market conditions. Variable consideration is typically not constrained at the time revenue is recognized. The Company records amounts billed to customers for the costs of shipping and handling in sales transactions as Revenue and such costs are not considered separate performance obligations. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,380

Goodwill is not amortized and is required to be assessed at least annually for impairment, or more frequently if triggering events indicate a possible impairment. The Company continually evaluates financial performance, economic conditions and other recent developments in assessing if a triggering event indicates that the carrying value of goodwill is impaired. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level by first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If the reporting unit does not pass the qualitative assessment, then a quantitative assessment is performed to compare the reporting unit’s carrying value to its fair value. Estimated fair values are developed primarily under an income approach that discounts estimated future cash flows using risk adjusted interest rates, as well as earnings multiples or other techniques as warranted. Fair values are subject to changes in underlying economic conditions. Alternatively, we are permitted to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to performing the quantitative assessment. Goodwill is considered impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. The fair value of the reporting unit is based on a discounted cash flow model involving several assumptions. Identifiable intangible assets consist of intellectual property, trade names, developed technology, backlog, and customer relationships and are also subject to evaluation for potential impairment if events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.

We provide products that help enhance human health and comfort, protect food quality and safety, advance energy efficiency, and create environmentally sustainable infrastructure. Key components in an HVACR ecosystem include the compressor, controls, the condenser and the evaporator. We provide best-in-class compressors, controls, components and solutions for residential, commercial, industrial and transportation applications. We are the largest global manufacturer in our served markets with approximately 40% share in overall global compression, including approximately 70% in the North America residential HVAC segment, and strong positions within our non-compression offerings. Our large installed base of more than 150 million HVAC compressor units globally drives profitable aftermarket sales due to replacement dynamics, with approximately 80% of our net sales tied to repair or replacement activity. Ongoing technology leadership is a key driver of our ability to capitalize on the replacement cycle, as each successive generation of compressor provides greater cost savings, energy efficiency and higher levels of environmental sustainability impact. The replacement cycle is primarily driven by repair and replacement of HVACR systems. Our installed base provides a foundation for ongoing earnings resilience as systems age and require repair or replacement. Global regulations around the impact of refrigerants on global warming and the need for energy efficiency amplify replacement dynamics in our business. Globally, government programs and incentives support the adoption of new, more sustainable products creating a strong forward looking growth environment. Secular trends tied to human health and comfort, as well as food quality, safety and sustainability drive additional demand for our compression and solutions offerings. As the heart of an HVAC system, the compressor is the system’s most critical component, yet represents a small percentage of the unit cost to the consumer. For example, approximately three to five percent of the residential HVAC unit cost is associated with the compressor, but the compressor has a mission-critical impact on function and efficiency. Compressors enable the separation of the low-pressure side of an HVAC system, where heat is absorbed into the refrigerant, from the high-pressure side of the system, where heat is discharged from the refrigerant to a cooling medium (typically the ambient outside air). The compressor mechanically reduces the volume of low-side refrigerant, thereby increasing its pressure and enabling heated refrigerant to flow to the high-pressure side of the system, where it is cooled. ----- We offer a variety of compressor technologies to meet customer-specific applications. Compression technology is essential to improving system efficiency. In addition, refrigerant selection is dependent on rigorous testing by compressor manufacturers to evaluate for performance and reliability and approve for use. Globally, the HVACR system manufacturers are dependent upon compressor innovation to meet regulations for efficiency and more environmentally friendly refrigerants. Because compressors are highly engineered to meet our customers’ technical requirements, we work closely with them on ER&D efforts to develop technology that meets consumer needs and complies with regulatory changes. These tightly coupled relationships result from our industry leadership and help provide us with good forward-looking visibility to market needs and opportunities to differentiate ourselves.",N/A,as_expected,2024,380

Through our market and technology leadership and global production capacity, we have achieved significant share with leading OEMs who represent approximately one-third of global sales. Our approximately 800 other customers account for the other two-thirds of global sales. These longtenured OEM relationships provide long-term volume stability, scale and influence. Our highly diversified customer base helps minimize risks associated with customer concentration. We tailor our go-to-market strategy across the value chain to best suit specific segments and end customers. Approximately two-thirds of our products are sold directly to OEMs globally. OEM customers seek advantages in efficiency, applied cost and compressor performance to reduce design complexity and improve performance. We also sell our products directly to secondary buyers such as distributors and contractors. Our strong reputation for product quality and durability, which reduce warranty costs for OEMs and the total long-term cost of ownership for end customers, has pull-through effects on OEMs and the entire value chain. We further collaborate with channel influencers, such as researchers, regulators, technical schools and utility providers, to create connectivity with the entire HVACR ecosystem. In the food retail and food service industries, we work directly with end users as well as the OEMs to provide solutions, which are sold either to the OEM, through intermediaries or directly to the end user. We and our customers invest significant time and resources in designing products to meet required specifications for each application and technology platform. As a result, we are highly integrated with our customers, augmenting our strong market position. OEMs launch new product platforms every seven to ten years, typically in connection with new regulatory standards. These new platforms require significant redesigns that need ----- many years of product development and close alignment between the OEM and its compressor suppliers. This dynamic inherently favors our company due to the long-standing, close working relationships between our engineering teams and our key OEM customers. Between formal launches, platforms are continually modified to reduce cost and improve efficiency and reliability.

1525,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.29,Our Industry,17.29.1,,"We participate in the HVACR compression and related solutions and controls markets with a focus on residential, commercial, refrigeration, transportation, industrial and cold chain applications. We estimate that the total annual sales in the market segments addressable by our current product offerings is approximately $13.4 billion and such market is expected to grow at a compound annual rate of approximately 4% over the next five years. Demand in our markets is supported by attractive macro drivers such as global regulation shifts, industrydriven sustainability goals and regulatory subsidies and incentives. Based on our current market positioning, our global scale and flexibility of our supply chain, and our manufacturing and ER&D capabilities, we are wellpositioned to capitalize on these trends. - **Regulatory Changes: Regulatory changes have driven change and innovation in our industry for decades. However, the frequency and impact of those changes has increased in recent years. These changes include updates to SEER requirements (and other global efficiency standards) and new standards on refrigerants that drive more frequent compressor and system innovations. The complexity resulting from these changes favors our global breadth and the depth of our engineering, technology and operations. In the United States, new efficiency regulations went into effect January 1, 2023. In 2025, new refrigerant regulations will again drive new compressors and systems into the market. Additional new regulations in the next seven to ten years are anticipated. Engineering and development efforts typically begin years in advance of the applicable regulation effective date. Our OEM customers depend on us to help them meet these requirements in a timely fashion while simultaneously helping them innovate and differentiate to meet their sustainability goals. Europe’s sustainability goals and their desire for energy sovereignty is driving goals and incentives targeting the installation of 30 million new heat pumps by 2030. - **Heat Pump Conversion: The growth of heat pumps is expected to bring new customers into the HVAC market, as households convert a furnace-only or gas-only system to a heat pump. According to a major consulting practice, consumers enjoy on average approximately $4,000 in lifetime savings ----- from heat pumps, supported by government subsidy programs and incentives available from utility providers. - Conversion to heat pumps is expected to be particularly strong in Europe, where high natural gas prices are incentivizing a transition to less energy-intensive heat pumps. The EU is in the process of revising its EPBD to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030, a legal obligation under the European climate law, and make the EU climate-neutral by 2050. While the revision is still under negotiation, the EPBD is expected to require member states to ensure that all new buildings after 2027 are zero-emission, and set deadlines after which the use of fossil fuel heating systems in new buildings, or in major building renovations or renovations of the heating systems, will not be permitted. Existing regulations across nine European countries have already implemented, or will implement by 2026, fossil fuel boiler bans in residential buildings. With the upcoming revision of the EPBD, we expect that all other EU member states will implement similar restrictions and the scope will ultimately comprise all existing buildings. Some countries also already provide, or are expected to provide, monetary incentives to accelerate the transition to clean heating, including heat pumps. With strong channel benefits and an existing customer base, the major legacy boilermakers are playing a critical role in the heat pump transition. Our HVAC compression expertise positions us as an important partner as legacy boilermakers help drive heat pump adoption. Our partnership and existing share with legacy boilermakers and HVAC OEMs positions us well to enable this transition. We are currently a leader in compression for the heat pump segment in Europe. - **COVID-19 / Hybrid Working: More waking hours spent at home are expected to maintain HVAC usage above pre-COVID-19 levels, shortening system useful life. According to a major consulting practice, these new working arrangements are expected to keep replacement rates elevated as approximately 45% of employees are predicted to be in hybrid working models in the future versus approximately 10% pre-COVID-19. HVACR industry executives also expect replacement rates to remain elevated. Run times in 2020 were quoted as being 30% higher than 2019 levels (after adjusting for weather), which should correlate to higher rates of replacement over time. - **Environmental and Population Shifts: With environmental change resulting in more extreme temperatures across the United States, and a population mix increasingly shifting to warmer southern states, HVAC usage has increased and is expected to continue to increase, resulting in shorter useful lives for HVAC equipment and higher replacement rates.",N/A,as_expected,2024,380

Replacement sales are more resilient and are associated with durable spend, often outperforming GDP growth rates during economic cycles. Both HVACR systems broadly and compressors specifically suffer from wear. Compressors may be replaced to extend the life of an HVACR system. Full system replacement occurs when HVACR units are beyond repair or when an end-user determines that the payback in higher efficiency, lower emissions and better reliability is sufficient to warrant the cost of replacement. Repair or replacement of a unit is non-discretionary because HVACR systems provide essential heating, cooling and refrigeration. Our resilient recovery during the 2007-2008 Global Financial Crisis speaks to the largely non-discretionary nature of HVAC repair and replacement. Despite an approximately 15% revenue contraction in 2009, our revenues rebounded quickly in 2010 with more than 19% growth before returning to normalized long-term growth rates. Over the same period, we delivered improvements in gross margin and EBITDA margin as we moved quickly to manage costs. Our cost structure is largely variable, enabling us to preserve margin during downturns such as the 2007-2008 Global Financial Crisis, the U.S. manufacturing downturn, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Secular industry tailwinds, including upcoming regulatory changes, heat pump conversion, shifts in population and the impact of hybrid working, are expected to drive an increase in HVAC usage. This increase in usage can create more wear on HVAC systems and shorten systems’ useful lives, resulting in increased repair and replacement rates and driving further demand for replacement products supporting our long-term resilient growth.",N/A,as_expected,2024,380

LLC (“JV NewCo GP”), BCP Emerald and certain wholly owned holding company subsidiaries of Emerson, and (ii) JV NewCo GP entered into an amended and restated limited liability company agreement (the “JV NewCo GP LLCA” and, together with the JV NewCo LPA, the “Governance Documents”) with BCP Emerald and certain wholly owned holding company subsidiaries of Emerson. Capitalized terms used in this section and not defined herein have the meanings set forth in the JV NewCo LPA and the JV NewCo GP LLCA, as applicable. Upon the closing of the Unit Purchase Transaction, Emerson’s rights under the Governance Documents will terminate (other than in respect of certain indemnification and confidentiality obligations) and the Governance Documents will be amended and restated to reflect such termination of rights. Pursuant to the Governance Documents: _Board Rights. JV NewCo is governed by the board of managers of JV NewCo GP (the “JV NewCo GP_ Board”), which will be comprised of up to ten managers and currently consists of three managers appointed by BCP Emerald, two managers to be appointed by Emerson, the CEO of JV NewCo (who will be a non-voting manager), and three independent managers appointed by BCP Emerald in consultation with Emerson. Each of BCP Emerald and Emerson have the right to appoint up to three non-voting board observers. The rights of BCP Emerald and Emerson to appoint managers to the JV NewCo GP Board (and the number of votes each manager may cast) are subject to agreed step-downs in connection with transfers of their equity interests in JV NewCo (provided that each will have the right to appoint at least one manager if they own more than 10% of JV NewCo). Actions of the JV NewCo GP Board require consent of the managers holding a majority of the votes. The managers appointed by BCP Emerald hold a majority of the votes of the JV NewCo GP Board, and such votes are controlled by the BCP Emerald managers who are investment professionals of Blackstone. _Consent Rights. Each of BCP Emerald and Emerson have consent rights over certain fundamental matters_ including, without limitation, related party transactions, any acquisition or disposition of assets or stock with a purchase price in excess of $1 billion, and any incurrence of indebtedness that would exceed a certain specified pro forma leverage ratio. The consent rights are subject to certain fall-away provisions. _Transfer and Liquidity Rights._ Emerson will not be able to transfer any interest in JV NewCo, subject to certain exceptions, including transfers (i) to certain affiliates, (ii) in an IPO or a change of control sale, (iii) following an IPO (subject to certain restrictions discussed below), (iv) with the approval of the JV NewCo GP Board prior to the second anniversary of the Closing, (v) subject to BCP Emerald’s “tag-along” rights, in an amount not to exceed 50% and 100% of its interests in JV NewCo after the second and fifth anniversaries of the Closing, respectively (provided that Emerson may not sell its interests to a competitor or activist investor), or (vi) pursuant to the exercise of Emerson’s customary “tag-along” rights or in a change of control sale. Transfers by Emerson are generally subject to a “right of first offer” by BCP Emerald over the interests proposed to be transferred. BCP Emerald generally has the right to transfer any interest in JV NewCo, however, Emerson has customary “tag-along” rights (as mentioned above) unless such transfer is (i) pursuant to customary permitted transfer provisions, including to certain affiliates, (ii) in an IPO or a change of control sale, or (iii) in connection with a syndication of BCP Emerald’s equity within six months of closing, subject to certain parameters. BCP Emerald will also have the ability to force a change of control sale of JV NewCo; however, before the second anniversary of the Closing, any such sale must generate an agreed upon return.

Certain volume-related transfer restrictions will apply to Emerson in and following an IPO of JV NewCo, through a priority sell-down right granted to BCP Emerald, until BCP Emerald has received an agreed amount of sale proceeds. _Preemptive rights.

Until 24 months after Emerson’s ownership interest in JV NewCo falls below_ 10%, Emerson and JV NewCo may not solicit the following employees of the other: (i) executive or managerial employees; and (ii) employees engaged in the provision of services to the other under the Transition Services Agreement (discussed further below) in a senior, technical or managerial role, in each case of (i) and (ii), subject to certain customary exceptions.",N/A,as_expected,2024,380

The Convertible PIK Preferred Equity is mandatorily convertible upon a Qualified IPO (as defined in the JV NewCo GP LLCA) by JV NewCo or upon a Change of Control (as defined in the JV NewCo LPA) of JV NewCo. In an IPO, if the price per share of common stock sold in such IPO is greater than a 10% premium above the common equity purchase price at the Closing, the Convertible PIK Preferred Equity will automatically convert into common shares of the IPO Corporation. Otherwise, the Convertible PIK Preferred Equity will convert into a cash-pay preferred instrument (the “Cash-Pay Preferred Equity”) paying dividends at a 9% annual rate. The CashPay Preferred Equity remains convertible into common stock up to the accreted amount of the Convertible PIK Preferred Equity. If the Seller Notes remain outstanding after a Non-Qualified IPO, dividends on the Cash-Pay Preferred Equity compound at a 9% rate, but are not paid until the Seller Notes are repaid in full.

The Guarantors, as primary obligors and not merely as sureties, will jointly and severally guarantee, fully and unconditionally, on a senior secured basis, the performance and full and punctual payment when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all obligations of the Issuers under the Indenture and the Notes, whether for payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the Notes or expenses, indemnification or otherwise, on the terms set forth in the Indenture by executing the Indenture or a supplement thereto. As further described in “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries,” in the future, certain additional Restricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer (other than the Co-Issuer) that guarantee certain Indebtedness of the Issuers or any Subsidiary Guarantor will guarantee the Notes, subject to certain exceptions and subject to release and discharge as described in this “Description of Notes.” Each of the Guarantees will be: - a general senior obligation of such Guarantor; - equal in right of payment with any existing and future Senior Indebtedness of such Guarantor; - senior in right of payment to any future Indebtedness of such Guarantor that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Guarantee of such Guarantor; - effectively senior to all existing and future unsecured Indebtedness of such Guarantor, to the extent of the value of the Collateral owned by such Guarantor; ----- - effectively senior as to the Fixed Asset Priority Collateral owned by such Guarantor with respect to all existing and future Indebtedness of such Guarantor that has a junior priority lien on the Fixed Asset Priority Collateral, including the Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations, to the extent of the value of such Fixed Asset Priority Collateral; - equal in priority as to the Collateral owned by such Guarantor with respect to any Equal Priority Obligations of such Guarantor, including the Senior Secured Credit Facility Obligations and the Existing Notes, to the extent of the value of such Collateral; - effectively subordinated as to the ABL Priority Collateral owned by such Guarantor with respect to all existing and future Indebtedness of such Guarantor that has a senior priority lien on the ABL Priority Collateral, including the Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations, to the extent of the value of such ABL Priority Collateral; - effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness of such Guarantor that is secured by Liens on assets that do not constitute a part of the Collateral to the extent of the value of such assets; and - structurally subordinated to all existing and future Indebtedness, claims of holders of Preferred Stock and other liabilities of such Guarantor’s Subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes (other than the Issuers). As of March 31, 2024, after giving effect to the offering, the New Term Loan B Facility and the use of proceeds therefrom: - the Issuers and the Guarantors would have had approximately $7,388.7 million in total indebtedness outstanding (excluding approximately $9.1 million of issued and undrawn letters of credit), none of which would have been subordinated and all of which would have been senior secured indebtedness, consisting of $950.0 million under the New Term Loan B Facility, $1,965.5 million of borrowings under the Term Loan Facilities, $3,523.2 million (equivalent) of the Existing Notes and $950.0 million of the notes; and - the Issuers would have had approximately $399.5 million of availability to incur additional secured indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility, subject to borrowing base capacity (after giving effect to approximately $9.1 million of letters of credit outstanding thereunder). From and after the Issue Date, all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries will be “Restricted Subsidiaries” unless designated as Unrestricted Subsidiaries in accordance with the Indenture. Under certain circumstances, we will be permitted to designate certain of our existing and future subsidiaries as “Unrestricted Subsidiaries.” Any Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture and will not guarantee the Notes.

In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization or similar proceeding of any of our non-guarantor Subsidiaries, such nonguarantor Subsidiaries will pay the holders of their debt and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to the Issuers or a Guarantor. As a result, all of the existing and future liabilities of our nonguarantor Subsidiaries, including any claims of trade creditors, will be structurally senior to the Notes and the Guarantees. The Indenture will not limit the amount of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness which may be incurred by the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries, including the non-guarantor Subsidiaries. Holdings and each Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer (other than the Co-Issuer) that guarantees the Senior Secured Credit Facilities will guarantee the Notes. The obligations of each Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance under applicable law. This provision may not, however, be ----- effective to protect a Guarantee from being voided under fraudulent transfer law, or may reduce the applicable Guarantor’s obligation to an amount that effectively makes its Guarantee worthless. If a Guarantee was rendered voidable, it could be subordinated by a court to all other indebtedness (including guarantees and other contingent liabilities) of the Guarantor, and, depending on the amount of such indebtedness, a Guarantor’s liability on its Guarantee could be reduced to zero. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to our Indebtedness and the Notes—Federal and state fraudulent transfer laws permit a court, under certain circumstances, to void the notes and the guarantees, and the liens securing the notes and the guarantees, subordinate claims in respect of the notes, the guarantees and the liens securing the notes and the guarantees and/or require holders of the notes to return payments received from us in respect of the guarantees and the liens and, if that occurs, you may not receive any payments on the notes.” Any Guarantor that makes a payment under its Guarantee will be entitled upon payment in full of all guaranteed obligations under the Indenture to a contribution from each other Guarantor in an amount equal to such other Guarantor’s pro rata portion of such payment based on the respective net assets of all the Guarantors at the time of such payment determined in accordance with GAAP. Each Guarantor may consolidate with, amalgamate or merge with or into or wind up into, or consummate a Division as a Dividing Person, or sell all or substantially all its assets to an Issuer or another Guarantor without limitation or any other Person upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Indenture.

Notwithstanding clause (5) above, if, after any Covenant Suspension Event, a Reversion Date shall occur, then the Suspension Period with respect to such Covenant Suspension Event shall terminate and all actions reasonably necessary to provide that the Notes shall have been unconditionally guaranteed by each Guarantor (to the extent such guarantee is required by the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries”) shall be taken within 90 days after such Reversion Date or as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter.

Under the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement, subject to the provisions set forth in the ABL/Fixed Asset Intercreditor Agreement with respect to the ABL Priority Collateral, only the “Controlling Collateral Agent” will have the right to act or refrain from acting with respect to any Shared Collateral. The Controlling Collateral Agent will initially be the Bank Collateral Agent and will remain the Bank Collateral Agent until the earlier of (1) the Discharge of Equal Priority Obligations that are Senior Secured Credit Facility Obligations and (2) the Non-Controlling Collateral Agent Enforcement Date (such earlier date, the “Controlling Collateral Agent Change Date”). After the Controlling Collateral Agent Change Date, the Controlling Collateral Agent will be the Collateral Agent (other than the Bank Collateral Agent) of the Series of Equal Priority Obligations that constitutes the largest outstanding principal amount of any then outstanding Series of Equal Priority Obligations (excluding the obligations under the Term Loan Facilities) with respect to such Shared Collateral (the “Major Non-Controlling Collateral Agent”).

Notwithstanding the equal priority of the Liens with respect to the Shared Collateral, the Controlling Collateral Agent may deal with the Shared Collateral as if the Controlling Collateral Agent had a senior Lien on such Collateral.

It is the intention of the Equal Priority Secured Parties of each Series that the holders of Equal Priority Obligations of such Series (and not the Equal Priority Secured Parties of any other Series) bear the risk of (i) any determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that (x) any of the Equal Priority Obligations of such Series are unenforceable under applicable law or are subordinated to any other obligations (other than another Series of Equal Priority Obligations), (y) any of the Equal Priority Obligations of such Series do not have an enforceable security interest in any of the Collateral securing any other Series of Equal Priority Obligations and/or (z) any intervening security interest exists securing any other obligations (other than another Series of Equal Priority Obligations) on a basis ranking prior to the security interest of such Series of Equal Priority Obligations but junior to the security interest of any other Series of Equal Priority Obligations or (ii) the existence of any Collateral for any other Series of Equal Priority Obligations that is not Shared Collateral (any such condition referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) or (ii) with respect to any Series of Equal Priority Obligations, an “Impairment” of such Series). In the event of any Impairment with respect to any Series of Equal Priority Obligations, the results of such Impairment shall be borne solely by the holders of such Series of Equal Priority Obligations, and the rights of the holders of such Series of Equal Priority Obligations (including, without limitation, the right to receive distributions in respect of such Series of Equal Priority Obligations permitted by the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement) set forth in the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement shall be modified to the extent necessary so that the effects of such Impairment are borne solely by the holders of the Series of such Equal Priority Obligations subject to such Impairment. Additionally, in the event the Equal Priority Obligations of any Series are modified pursuant to applicable law (including, without limitation, pursuant to Section 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code), any reference to such Equal Priority Obligations or the Equal Priority Documents governing such Equal Priority Obligations shall refer to such obligations or such documents as so modified. None of the Equal Priority Secured Parties may institute in any suit, bankruptcy, insolvency or other proceeding any claim against the Controlling Collateral Agent or any other Equal Priority Secured Party seeking damages from or other relief by way of specific performance, instructions or otherwise with respect to any Shared ----- Collateral. In addition, none of the Equal Priority Secured Parties may seek to have any Collateral or any part thereof marshaled upon any foreclosure or other disposition of such Collateral. If any Equal Priority Secured Party obtains possession of any Shared Collateral or realizes any proceeds or payment in respect thereof pursuant to any Equal Priority Security Document or by the exercise of any rights available to it under applicable law or in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding or through any other exercise of remedies (including pursuant to any intercreditor agreement), at any time prior to the discharge of each of the Equal Priority Obligations, then it must hold such Shared Collateral, proceeds or payment in trust for the other Equal Priority Secured Parties and promptly transfer such Shared Collateral, proceeds or payment to the Controlling Collateral Agent to be distributed in accordance with the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement. Under the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement, if at any time the Controlling Collateral Agent forecloses upon or otherwise exercises remedies against any Shared Collateral resulting in a sale or disposition thereof, then (whether or not any insolvency or liquidation proceeding is pending at the time) the Liens in favor of the other Collateral Agents for the benefit of the Trustee, the Notes Collateral Agent and the Holders of the Notes and each other Series of Equal Priority Secured Parties upon such Shared Collateral will automatically be released and discharged. However, any proceeds of any Shared Collateral realized therefrom will be applied as described in the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement. The Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the provisions of it are intended to be and shall be enforceable under Section 510(a) of the Bankruptcy Code or under any equivalent provision of any other applicable Bankruptcy Law. _Certain Limitations Applicable in Bankruptcy Proceedings_ If the Issuers or any Guarantor become subject to any bankruptcy case, the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement provides that if the Issuers or any Guarantor shall, as debtor(s)-in-possession, move for approval of financing (“DIP Financing”) to be provided by one or more lenders (the “DIP Lenders”) under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code and/or the use of cash collateral under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code (in each case, or under any equivalent provision of any other applicable bankruptcy law), each Equal Priority Secured Party will agree not to object to any such financing or to the Liens on the Shared Collateral securing the same (the “DIP Financing",N/A,as_expected,2024,380

The Notes Collateral Agent will enter into a joinder to the ABL/Fixed Asset Intercreditor Agreement in respect of the Collateral securing the Equal Priority Obligations. The ABL/Fixed Asset Intercreditor Agreement sets forth the relative priority of the Liens securing the Equal Priority Obligations and, if applicable, certain future Junior Lien Obligations (the “Non-ABL Obligations”), on the one hand, compared to the Liens on the Collateral securing the Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations (collectively, all such Non-ABL Obligations and Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations, the “Applicable Obligations”), on the other hand. Although the holders of Non-ABL Obligations and Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations will not be parties to the ABL/Fixed Asset Intercreditor Agreement, by their acceptance of the instruments evidencing such Obligations, each authorizes their Applicable Collateral Agent to enter into the ABL/Fixed Asset Intercreditor Agreement and each agrees to be bound thereby. The ABL/Fixed Asset Intercreditor Agreement will allocate the benefits of any Collateral between the holders of the Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations on the one hand and the holders of the Non-ABL Obligations on the other hand. The ABL/Fixed Asset Intercreditor Agreement will provide, among other things: _Lien Priority. Notwithstanding the time, order or method of grant, creation, attachment or perfection of any_ Liens securing any Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations (the “ABL Liens”), the Liens securing any Non-ABL Obligations (the “Non-ABL Liens”), the defects or deficiencies in any such Liens or other circumstances whatsoever, (1) the ABL Liens on the ABL Priority Collateral securing such Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations will rank senior to any Non-ABL Liens on the ABL Priority Collateral securing such Non-ABL Obligations, and (2) the Non-ABL Liens on the Fixed Asset Priority Collateral securing such Non-ABL Obligations will rank senior to any ABL Liens on the Fixed Asset Priority Collateral securing such Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations. _Prohibition on Contesting Liens and Obligations. No Applicable Collateral Agent with respect to, and no_ holder of, any class of Applicable Obligations may contest or support any other person in contesting the validity, perfection, priority or enforceability of the Liens of any other Applicable Collateral Agent with respect to, or holder of, any other class of Applicable Obligations. ----- _Exercise of Remedies and Release of Liens with respect to the ABL Priority Collateral. Prior to the_ discharge of the Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations, the Senior ABL Credit Agreement Collateral Agent will have the sole power to exercise remedies against the ABL Priority Collateral (subject to the right of each Collateral Agent for any series of Equal Priority Obligations to take limited protective measures with respect to the Non-ABL Liens and to take certain actions that would be permitted to be taken by unsecured creditors not otherwise prohibited by the ABL/Fixed Asset Intercreditor Agreement) and to foreclose upon and dispose of the ABL Priority Collateral. Upon any sale of any ABL Priority Collateral in connection with any exercise of remedies with respect to such ABL Priority Collateral that results in the release of the Liens of the Senior ABL Credit Agreement Collateral Agent on such item of ABL Priority Collateral, the Liens of each other class of Applicable Obligations on such item of ABL Priority Collateral will be automatically released. _Exercise of Remedies and Release of Liens with respect to the Fixed Asset Priority Collateral. Prior to the_ discharge of the Non-ABL Obligations, the Controlling Collateral Agent (or any person authorized by it) will have the sole power to exercise remedies against the Fixed Asset Priority Collateral (subject to the right of the Senior ABL Credit Agreement Collateral Agent to take limited protective measures with respect to the ABL Liens and to take certain actions that would be permitted to be taken by unsecured creditors not otherwise prohibited by the ABL/Fixed Asset Intercreditor Agreement) and to foreclose upon and dispose of the Fixed Asset Priority Collateral.

In connection with any enforcement action with_ respect to the Collateral or in respect of any insolvency or liquidation proceeding, (x)(1) all proceeds of ABL Priority Collateral will first be applied to the repayment of all Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations in accordance with the Senior ABL Credit Agreement, before being applied to any Non-ABL Obligations; and (2) after the discharge of Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations, if any Non-ABL Obligations remain outstanding, all proceeds of ABL Priority Collateral will be applied to the repayment of any outstanding Non-ABL Obligations in accordance with the terms of the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement and any other applicable intercreditor agreement; and (y)(1) all proceeds of Fixed Asset Priority Collateral shall be applied to Non-ABL Obligations in accordance with the terms of the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement and any other applicable intercreditor agreement, before being applied to the Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations; and (2) after the discharge of Non-ABL Obligations, if any Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations remain outstanding, all proceeds of Fixed Asset Priority Collateral will be applied to the repayment of any outstanding Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations in accordance with the Senior ABL Credit Agreement. If any holder of any Applicable Obligations or if any Applicable Collateral Agent receives any proceeds of Collateral in contravention of the foregoing, such proceeds will be turned over to the Applicable Collateral Agent entitled to receive such proceeds pursuant to the prior sentence, for application in accordance with the prior sentence. _Amendment and Refinancings.

The ABL/Fixed Asset Intercreditor Agreement will also provide for customary access and use of the Fixed Asset Priority Collateral for purposes of exercising remedies with respect to the ABL Priority Collateral, and that the Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations and the Non-ABL Obligations shall be deemed separate classes of secured obligations.

Plans of Reorganization No Junior Lien Representative or any other Junior Lien Secured Party (whether in the capacity of a secured or unsecured creditor) may directly or indirectly propose, support or vote in favor of any plan of reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan that is inconsistent with the priorities or other provisions of the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement, other than with the prior written consent of the Controlling Collateral Agent or to the extent any such plan is proposed or supported by the class of holders of Equal Priority Obligations required under Section 1126(c) of the Bankruptcy Code. Each Junior Lien Representative, for itself and on behalf of each applicable Junior Lien Secured Party, will acknowledge and agree that (a) the grants of Liens securing the Equal Priority Obligations and the Junior Lien Obligations constitute separate and distinct grants of Liens and (b) because of, among other things, their differing rights in the Collateral, the Junior Lien Obligations are fundamentally different from the Equal Priority Obligations and must be separately classified in any plan of reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan proposed, confirmed or adopted in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding. To further effectuate the intent of the parties as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, if it is held that the claims of the Equal Priority Secured Parties and the Junior Lien Secured Parties in respect of the Collateral constitute only one secured claim (rather than separate classes of senior and junior secured claims) under a plan of reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan, then each Junior Lien Representative, for itself and on behalf of the applicable Junior Lien Secured Parties, will acknowledge and agree that all distributions from the Collateral shall be made as if there were separate classes of senior and junior secured claims against the Issuers and the Guarantors in respect of the Collateral (with the effect being that, to the extent that the aggregate value of the Collateral is sufficient (for this purpose ignoring all claims held by the Junior Lien Secured Parties), the Equal Priority Secured Parties shall be entitled to receive, in addition to amounts distributed to them in respect of principal, pre-petition interest and other claims, all amounts owing in respect of post-petition interest, fees, and expenses (whether or not allowed or allowable in such insolvency or liquidation proceeding) before any distribution is made from the Collateral in respect of the Junior Lien Obligations, with each Junior Lien Representative, for itself and on behalf of each applicable Junior Lien Secured Party, acknowledging and agreeing to turn over to the Controlling Collateral Agent amounts otherwise received or receivable by them from the Collateral to the extent necessary to effectuate the intent of this sentence, even if such turnover has the effect of reducing the claim or recovery of the Junior Lien Secured Parties. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,380

The amount to be received upon a sale of the Collateral would also be dependent on numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the actual fair market value of the Collateral at such time and the timing and the manner of the sale. By their nature, portions of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Collateral can be sold in a short period of time or in an orderly manner. In addition, as discussed further below, the Holders of the Notes will not be entitled to receive post-petition interest or applicable fees, costs, expenses, or charges to the extent the amount of the obligations due under the Notes exceeds the value of the Collateral (after taking into account all other first- priority debt that is also secured by the Collateral), or any “adequate protection” on account of any undersecured portion of the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2024,380

Upon the commencement of a case for relief under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, a secured creditor such as the Notes Collateral Agent is prohibited from foreclosing upon or repossessing its security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from disposing of previously repossessed security without prior bankruptcy court approval (which may not be given under the circumstances). In view of the broad equitable powers of a U.S. bankruptcy court and the lack of a precise definition of the meaning of “adequate protection,” it is impossible to predict whether or when payments under the Notes could be made following the commencement of a bankruptcy case (or the length of the delay in making any such payments), whether or when the Notes Collateral Agent could or would repossess or dispose of the Collateral, the value of the Collateral at any time during a bankruptcy case or whether or to what extent Holders of the Notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the Collateral. The U.S. Bankruptcy Code permits the payment and/or accrual of post-petition interest, expenses, costs and attorneys’ fees to a secured creditor during a debtor’s bankruptcy case only to the extent the value of such creditor’s interest in the Collateral is determined by the bankruptcy court to exceed the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the obligations secured by the Collateral. Furthermore, in the event a domestic or foreign bankruptcy court determines that the value of the Collateral is not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes, the Holders of the Notes would hold secured claims only to the extent of the value of the Collateral to which the Holders of the Notes are entitled, and unsecured “deficiency” claims with respect to such shortfall, which deficiency claims would not need to be adequately protected during a bankruptcy case.",N/A,as_expected,2024,380

On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuers will, to the extent permitted by law: (1) accept for payment all Notes issued by it or portions thereof validly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (2) deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the aggregate Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions thereof so tendered and not validly withdrawn; and (3) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee for cancellation the Notes so accepted together with an Officer’s Certificate stating that such Notes or portions thereof have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuers. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Senior ABL Credit Agreement provide, and future credit agreements or other agreements relating to Indebtedness to which the Issuers (or one of its Affiliates) become a party may provide, that certain change of control events with respect to the Issuers would constitute a default thereunder (which may include a Change of Control or a Change of Control Triggering Event under the Indenture). In addition, the indenture governing the Existing Notes contain a change of control provision that provides for a put right upon the occurrence of a “change of control triggering event” (defined in a manner similar to “Change of Control Triggering Event” as defined herein). If we experience a change of control event that triggers a default under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Senior ABL Credit Agreement, the Existing Notes or any such future Indebtedness, we could seek a waiver of such default or seek to refinance the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Senior ABL Credit Agreement and/or such future Indebtedness or results in a requirement to offer to repurchase either series of Existing Notes. In the event we do not obtain such a waiver or do not refinance the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Senior ABL Credit Agreement, the Existing Notes and/or such future Indebtedness, such default or failure to repurchase any tendered Existing Notes could result in amounts outstanding under the Senior ----- Secured Credit Facilities, the Senior ABL Credit Agreement, the Existing Notes or such future Indebtedness being declared due and payable and/or cause a Securitization Facility or other financing arrangements to be wound down. Our ability to pay cash to the Holders following the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be limited by our then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Change of Control Triggering Event purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. We have no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control, although it is possible that we could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, we could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” and, in the case of Secured Indebtedness, “— Certain Covenants—Liens.” Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Required Holders. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders of the Notes protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. The Issuers will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control Triggering Event if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuers and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) in connection with or in contemplation of any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Issuers (or any Affiliate of the Issuers) have made an offer to purchase (an “Alternate Offer”) any and all Notes validly tendered at a cash price equal to or higher than the Change of Control Payment and has purchased all Notes properly tendered in accordance with the terms of the Alternate Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event, conditional upon such Change of Control Triggering Event, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of making of the Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer. A Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer may be made at the same time as consents are solicited with respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture, Notes, Guarantees and/or Security Documents (but the Change of Control Offer and the Alternate Offer may not condition tenders on the delivery of such consents). The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuers to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event, including the definition of “Change of Control,” may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Required Holders.",N/A,as_expected,2024,380

If the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of Notes or such other Equal Priority Obligations or other Obligations, as the case may be, surrendered by such holders thereof exceeds the amount offered in the Asset Sale Offer (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Issuers shall purchase the Notes (subject to applicable DTC procedures as to global notes) and such other Equal Priority Obligations or other Obligations, as the case may be, on a pro rata basis based on the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of the Notes or such other Equal Priority Obligations or other Obligations, as the case may be, tendered with adjustments as necessary so that no Notes or such other Equal Priority Obligations or other Obligations, as the case may be, will be repurchased in part in an unauthorized denomination. Upon completion of any such Asset Sale Offer (or Advance Offer), the amount of Excess Proceeds (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) that resulted in the requirement to make an Asset Sale Offer shall be reset to zero (regardless of whether there are any remaining Excess Proceeds (or Advance Portion) upon such completion). Additionally, the Issuers may, at their option, make an Asset Sale Offer using Applicable Proceeds at any time after the consummation of such Asset Sale. Upon consummation or expiration of any Asset Sale Offer (or Advance Offer), any remaining Applicable Proceeds shall not be deemed Excess Proceeds and the Issuers may use such Applicable Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited under the Indenture. An Asset Sale Offer or Advance Offer may be made at the same time as consents are solicited with respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture, Notes, Guarantees and/or Security Documents (but the Asset Sale Offer or Advance Offer may not condition tenders on the delivery of such consents). Pending the final application of the amount of any Applicable Proceeds pursuant to this covenant, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily reduce Indebtedness, or otherwise use such Applicable Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture. The Issuers will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer or an Advance Offer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuers may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions.

The Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Senior ABL Credit Agreement and future credit agreements or other similar agreements to which the Issuers become a party may contain restrictions on the Issuers’ ability to repurchase Notes. In the event an Asset Sale occurs at a time when the Issuers are prohibited from purchasing Notes, the Issuers could seek the consent of its lenders to the repurchase of Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Issuers do not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, the Issuers will remain prohibited from repurchasing Notes. In such a case, the Issuers’ failure to repurchase tendered Notes would constitute a Default under the Indenture which would, in turn, likely constitute a default under such other agreements. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,380

The principal amount or liquidation preference of any Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, if incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such respective Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing. The Indenture will not treat (1) unsecured Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to Secured Indebtedness merely because it is unsecured or (2) Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to any other Indebtedness merely because it has a junior priority with respect to the same collateral or because it is secured by different collateral or issued or guaranteed by other obligors.",N/A,as_expected,2024,380

In addition, each Directing Holder is deemed, at the time of providing a Noteholder Direction, to covenant to provide the Issuer with such other information as the Issuer may reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such Directing Holder’s Position Representation within five Business Days of request therefor (a “Verification Covenant”). In any case in which the Holder is DTC or DTC’s nominee, any Position Representation or Verification Covenant required hereunder shall be provided by the beneficial owner of the Notes in lieu of DTC or DTC’s nominee and DTC shall be entitled to conclusively rely on such Position Representation and Verification Covenant in delivering its direction to the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Issuer determines in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was, at any relevant time, in breach of its Position Representation and the Issuer provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate certifying that the Issuer has (i) a good faith reasonable basis to believe that one or more Directing Holders were at any relevant time in breach of their Position Representation or their Verification Covenant and (ii) initiated proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction seeking a determination that such Directing Holders were, at such time, in breach of their Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder ----- Direction, the cure period with respect to such Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to such Event of Default shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending a final and nonappealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction on such matter. If such Officer’s Certificate has been delivered to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, if applicable, the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, shall refrain from acting in accordance with such Noteholder Direction until such time as the Issuer provides to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, if applicable, an Officer’s Certificate stating that (i) such Directing Holders have satisfied their Verification Covenant or (ii) such Directing Holders have failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant, and during such time the cure period with respect to any Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending satisfaction of such Verification Covenant. Any breach of the Position Representation shall result in such Directing Holder’s participation in such Noteholder Direction being disregarded; and, if, without the participation of such Directing Holder, the percentage of Notes held by the remaining Holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio (other than any indemnity such Holder may have offered or provided to the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent), with the effect that such Event of Default shall be deemed never to have occurred, and any related acceleration rescinded, and the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, if applicable, shall be deemed not to have received such Noteholder Direction or any notice of such alleged Default or Event of Default, shall not be permitted to act thereon and shall be restricted from accepting and acting on any future Noteholder Direction in relation to such Event of Default. If the Directing Holder has satisfied its Verification Covenant, then the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, if applicable, shall be permitted to act in accordance with such Noteholder Direction. Notwithstanding the above, if such Directing Holder’s participation is not required to achieve the requisite level of consent of Holders required under the Indenture to give such Noteholder Direction, the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, if applicable, shall be permitted to act in accordance with such Noteholder Direction notwithstanding any action taken or to be taken by the Issuer (as described above). Each of the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any Noteholder Direction or Officer’s Certificate delivered to it in accordance with the Indenture without verification, investigation or otherwise as to the statements made therein. Notwithstanding anything in the preceding two paragraphs to the contrary, any Noteholder Direction delivered to the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent during the pendency of an Event of Default as the result of a bankruptcy or similar proceeding shall not require compliance with the foregoing paragraphs. In addition, for the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing paragraphs shall not apply to any Holder that is a Regulated Bank. Each Holder by accepting a Note acknowledges and agrees that neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent (nor any agent) shall not be liable to any person for acting or refraining to act in accordance with (i) the foregoing provisions, (ii) any Noteholder Direction, (iii) any Officer’s Certificate or (iv) its duties under the Indenture, as the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent, if applicable, may determine in its sole discretion. Neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent shall have any obligation (i) to monitor, investigate, verify or otherwise determine if a Holder has a Net Short position, (ii) investigate the accuracy or authenticity of any Position Representation, (iii) inquire if the Issuer will seek action to determine if a Directing Holder has breached its Position Representation, (iv) enforce any Verification Covenant, (v) monitor any court proceedings undertaken in connection therewith, (vi) monitor or investigate whether any Default or Event of Default has been publicly reported or (vii) otherwise make any calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to any Derivative Instruments, Net Short position, Long Derivative Instrument, Short Derivative Instrument or otherwise. Upon the effectiveness of such declaration, or in the case of clauses (3), (4), (5), (7), (8) or (9) of the first paragraph of this section, upon a valid Noteholder Direction, to accelerate the Notes, such principal of and premium, if any, and interest will be due and payable immediately. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an Event of Default arising under clause (6) of the first paragraph of this section, all outstanding Notes will become due and payable without further action or notice. The Indenture will provide that the Trustee may withhold from the Holders notice of any continuing Default, except a Default relating to the payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest, if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest. The Indenture will provide, subject to the foregoing, that the Required Holders, by notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes waive any existing Default and its consequences under the Indenture or the Security Documents and rescind any acceleration with respect to the Notes and its consequences (except if such rescission would conflict with any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction and except a ----- continuing Default in the payment of interest on, premium, if any, or the principal of, any Note held by a nonconsenting Holder). In the event of any Event of Default specified in clauses (3), (4), (5), (7), (8) or (9) of the first paragraph of this section, such Event of Default and all consequences thereof (excluding any resulting payment default, other than as a result of acceleration of the Notes) shall be annulled, waived and rescinded, automatically and without any action by the Trustee or the Holders, if after such Event of Default arose: (1) the Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been discharged; (2) the requisite number of holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action (as the case may be) giving rise to such Event of Default; or (3) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured. In case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent will be under any obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders of the Notes unless the Holders have offered and, if requested, provided to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, if applicable, indemnity or security satisfactory to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, if applicable, against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium (if any) or interest when due on or after the respective due dates expressed in an outstanding Note, no Holder of a Note may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless: (1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing and, if such Event of Default is in respect of clause (3), (4), (5), (7), (8) or (9) of the first paragraph of this section, such Holder is not in breach of a Position Representation or Verification Covenant; (2) the Holders, or in the case of clauses (3), (4), (5), (7) (8) or (9) of the first paragraph of this section, Directing Holders that are not in breach of a Position Representation or Verification Covenant, comprising at least 30% in the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have requested in writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) Holders of the Notes have offered, and if requested, provided to the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt thereof and the offer of security or indemnity; and (5) the Required Holders have not given the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such written request within such 60-day period. Subject to certain restrictions contained in the Indenture, including those described above, the Required Holders are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder of a Note or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability, and may take any other action that is not inconsistent with any such direction received from Holders of the Notes (it being understood that the Trustee does not have an affirmative duty to determine whether any action is prejudicial to any Holder). The Indenture will provide that the Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding compliance with the Indenture, and the Issuer is required, within 20 Business Days upon becoming aware of any Default, to deliver to the Trustee a statement specifying such Default (unless such Default has been cured or waived within such 20-Business Day time period). The Trustee will not be deemed to have knowledge of any ----- Defaults or Events of Default unless written notice of an event, which is in fact a Default, has been delivered to the Trustee at its office specified in the Indenture and such notice references the Notes and the Indenture and states that it is a “Notice of Default.” Any Default or Event of Default resulting from the failure to deliver a notice, report or certificate under the Indenture shall cease to exist and be cured in all respects if the underlying Default or Event of Default giving rise to such notice, report or certificate requirement shall have ceased to exist and/or be cured (including pursuant to this paragraph). For the avoidance of doubt, each of the parties hereto agree that any court of competent jurisdiction may (x) extend or stay any grace period set forth in the Indenture prior to when any actual or alleged Default becomes an actual or alleged Event of Default or (y) stay the exercise of remedies by the Trustee or Holders contemplated by the Indenture or otherwise upon the occurrence of an actual or alleged Event of Default, in each case of clauses (x) and (y), in accordance with the requirements of applicable law.",N/A,as_expected,2024,380

The notes will be issued at the closing of this offering only against payment in immediately available funds. Except as set forth below, the notes will be issued in registered, global form in minimum denominations of $2,000 and any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof. Until the end of the Distribution Compliance Period, beneficial interests in the Regulation S Global Notes may be held only through Euroclear and Clearstream (as Indirect Participants in DTC), unless transferred to a person that takes delivery through a Rule 144A Global Note in accordance with the certification requirements described below.

These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the respective settlement systems and ----- are subject to changes by them. The Issuers, Trustee, Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent take no responsibility for these operations and procedures and urge investors to contact the system or their Participants directly to discuss these matters. DTC has advised us that DTC is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of New York, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the Uniform Commercial Code and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC was created to hold securities for its participating organizations (collectively, the “Participants”) and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of transactions in those securities between Participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of its Participants. The Participants include securities brokers and dealers (including the initial purchasers), banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access to DTC’s system is also available to other entities such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Participant, either directly or indirectly (collectively, the “Indirect Participants”). Persons who are not Participants may beneficially own securities held by or on behalf of DTC only through the Participants or the Indirect Participants. The ownership interests in, and transfers of ownership interests in, each security held by or on behalf of DTC are recorded on the records of the Participants and Indirect Participants. DTC has also advised us that, pursuant to procedures established by it: (1) upon deposit of the Global Notes, DTC will credit the accounts of Participants designated by the initial purchasers with portions of the principal amount of the Global Notes; and (2) ownership of these interests in the Global Notes will be shown on, and the transfer of ownership of these interests will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to the Participants) or by the Participants and the Indirect Participants (with respect to other owners of beneficial interests in the Global Notes). Investors in the Rule 144A Global Notes who are Participants in DTC’s system may hold their interests therein directly through DTC. Investors in the Rule 144A Global Notes who are not Participants may hold their interests therein indirectly through organizations (including Euroclear and Clearstream) which are Participants in such system. Investors in the Regulation S Global Notes must initially hold their interests therein through Euroclear or Clearstream, if they are Participants in such systems, or indirectly through organizations that are Participants. After the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period (but not earlier), investors may also hold interests in the Regulation S Global Notes through Participants in the DTC system other than Euroclear and Clearstream. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in the Regulation S Global Notes on behalf of their Participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective depositories, which are Euroclear Bank SA/NV, as operator of Euroclear, and Citibank, N.A., as operator of Clearstream. All interests in a Global Note may be subject to the procedures and requirements of DTC. Those interests held through Euroclear or Clearstream may also be subject to the procedures and requirements of such systems. The laws of some states require that certain Persons take physical delivery in definitive form of securities that they own. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests in a Global Note to such Persons will be limited to that extent. Because DTC can act only on behalf of Participants, which in turn act on behalf of Indirect Participants, the ability of a Person having beneficial interests in a Global Note to pledge such interests to Persons that do not participate in the DTC system, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interests, may be affected by the lack of a physical certificate evidencing such interests.",N/A,as_expected,2024,380

Any beneficial interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a Person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in another Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be an interest in such Global Note and will become an interest in such other Global Note and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions and other procedures applicable to beneficial interests in such other Global Note for so long as it remains such an interest.

We expect that secondary trading in any Certificated Notes will also be settled in immediately available funds. Because of time zone differences, the securities account of a Euroclear or Clearstream Participant purchasing an interest in a Global Note from a DTC Participant will be credited, and any such crediting will be reported to the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream Participant, during the securities settlement processing day (which must be a business day for Euroclear and Clearstream) immediately following the settlement date of DTC.

DTC has advised us that its current practice, upon receipt of any payment in respect of securities such as the notes (including principal and interest), is to credit the accounts of the relevant Participants with the payment on the payment date unless DTC has reason to believe it will not receive payment on such payment date. Each relevant Participant is credited with an amount proportionate to its beneficial ownership of an interest in the principal amount of the relevant security as shown on the records of DTC. Payments by the Participants and the Indirect Participants to the beneficial owners of notes will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices and will be the responsibility of the Participants or the Indirect Participants and will not be the responsibility of DTC, the Trustee or the Issuers.

DTC has advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of notes only at the direction of one or more Participants to whose account DTC has credited the interests in the Global Notes and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of the notes as to which such Participant or Participants has or have given such direction. However, if there is an event of default under the notes, DTC reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for legended notes in certificated form, and to distribute such notes to its Participants. Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the notes described herein, cross-market transfers between DTC Participants, on the one hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream Participants, on the other hand, will be effected through DTC in accordance with DTC’s rules on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by their respective depositaries; however, such cross-market transactions will require delivery of instructions to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by the counterparty in such system in accordance with the rules and procedures and within the established deadlines (Brussels time) of such system. Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, will, if the transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to its respective depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving interests in the relevant Global Note in DTC, and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-day funds settlement applicable to DTC. Euroclear Participants and Clearstream Participants may not deliver instructions directly to the depositories for Euroclear or Clearstream. Although DTC has agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests in the Global Notes among Participants in DTC, it is under no obligation to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued or changed at any time. Neither the Issuers nor the Trustee, Dollar Paying Agent, Dollar Registrar and Transfer Agent, nor any of their respective agents, will have any responsibility for the performance by DTC or its Participants or Indirect Participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,380

Our position is binding on you unless you disclose that you are taking a contrary position in the manner required by applicable United States Treasury regulations. However, the position is not binding on the IRS. If the IRS were to successfully challenge this position, you might be required to, among other things, accrue interest income at a higher rate than the stated interest rate on the notes, and to treat as ordinary income (rather than capital gain) any gain recognized on the taxable disposition of a note.

The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all-inclusive. Due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries or other persons considering purchasing or holding the notes (or any interest therein) on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their legal advisors regarding the potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws to such investment and whether an exemption would be applicable to the purchase and holding of the notes (and any interest therein). Each purchaser and subsequent transferee has exclusive responsibility for ensuring that its purchase and holding of the notes (and any interest therein) does not violate the fiduciary responsibility or prohibited transaction rules of ERISA or the Code, or the provisions of any applicable Similar Laws.

1525,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,243,WHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION,243.4,Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm,243.4.1,,"To the Shareholders and Board of Directors Emerald JV Holdings L.P.: _Opinion on the Consolidated and Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements_ We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Emerald JV Holdings L.P. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of September 30, 2023 (Successor) and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive (loss) income, equity, and cash flows for the four months ended September 30, 2023 (Successor period) and the consolidated and combined balance sheet as of September 30, 2022 (Predecessor) and the related consolidated and combined statements of operations, comprehensive (loss) income, equity, and cash flows for the eight months ended May 31, 2023 and the year ended September 30, 2022 (Predecessor periods) and the related notes to the consolidated and consolidated and combined financial statements (collectively, the consolidated and consolidated and combined financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated and consolidated and combined financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2023 (Successor) and September 30, 2022 (Predecessor), and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the Successor and Predecessor periods, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. _New Basis of Accounting_ As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated and consolidated and combined financial statements, effective May 31, 2023, the Company was acquired in a business combination. As a result of the acquisition, the financial information for the period after the acquisition is presented on a different cost basis than that for the periods before the acquisition and, therefore, is not comparable. _Basis for Opinion_ These consolidated and consolidated and combined financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated and consolidated and combined financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB and in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated and consolidated and combined financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated and consolidated and combined financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated and consolidated and combined financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated and consolidated and combined financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. KPMG LLP, a Delaware limited liability partnership and a member firm of ----- _Critical Audit Matters_ The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated and consolidated and combined financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated and consolidated and combined financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated and consolidated and combined financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. _Sufficiency of audit evidence over net sales_ As discussed in Notes 1 and 3 to the Company’s consolidated and consolidated and combined financial statements, and disclosed in the consolidated and consolidated and combined statements of operations, the Company recorded $1,676.9 million of net sales for the four months ended September 30, 2023 (Successor) and $3,162.3 million for the eight months ended May 31, 2023 (Predecessor). We identified the evaluation of the sufficiency of audit evidence over net sales as a critical audit matter. Net sales are recognized primarily from the sale of manufactured products at locations in multiple countries around the world. Evaluating the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained required subjective auditor judgment because of the geographical dispersion of the Company’s net sales generating activities. This included determining the locations at which procedures were performed and evaluating the evidence obtained over net sales. The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We applied auditor judgment to determine the nature and extent of procedures to be performed over net sales, including the determination of the Company locations at which those procedures were to be performed. For one financially significant location, we performed a software-assisted data analysis to test the relationships among certain revenue transactions. For other locations for which procedures were performed, we assessed the recorded net sales by selecting a sample of transactions and compared the amounts recognized for consistency with underlying documentation, including contracts with customers and other third-party evidence. We evaluated the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained by assessing the results of procedures performed, including the appropriateness of the nature and extent of such evidence. _Valuation of customer relationships acquired in the business combination._ As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated and consolidated and combined financial statements, on October 30, 2022, the Company entered into a Transaction Agreement with Emerson, BCP Emerald Aggregator L.P. (BCP) and Emerald Debt Merger Sub L.L.C. whereby BCP agreed to purchase, and Emerson agreed to sell, equity interests in JV NewCo following the Restructuring for a purchase price of $13,647.1 million. The acquisition was consummated on May 31, 2023. As of the date of the transaction, the Company recognized customer relationships intangible assets acquired with a provisional estimated fair value of $4,250.0 million, which includes customer relationships related to the HVACR Technologies business unit. The Company determined the fair value of the customer relationships using the multi-period excess earnings methodology. We identified the valuation of the customer relationship intangible asset related to the HVACR Technologies business unit as a critical audit matter. We performed a sensitivity analysis to determine which assumptions used by management most significantly impacted the fair value of the customer relationship intangible asset. A high degree of subjective auditor judgement was required to evaluate certain assumptions in the valuation of the customer relationship intangible asset, specifically the revenue growth rates and EBITDA margins. Additionally, evaluating the discount rate and the customer attrition rate required the involvement of valuation professionals with specialized skills. Changes in these assumptions ----- could have had a significant impact on the fair value of the HVACR Technologies business unit customer relationship intangible asset. The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design of certain internal controls related to the Company’s acquisition date valuation process, including controls related to the development of the revenue growth rates, EBITDA margins and customer attrition rate assumptions. We evaluated the revenue growth rates and EBITDA margins by comparing them to the historical financial results of the acquired business and historical financial results and projections of certain peer companies. We involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in: - evaluating the discount rate by comparing it to independently developed ranges of the weighted average cost of capital and the weighted average return on assets, and recomputing the discount rate - evaluating the customer attrition rate by comparing it to the Company’s historical customer attrition data - evaluating the customer attrition rate by comparing it to implied customer attrition rates in similar transactions in the Company’s industry. _Valuation of developed technology and trade name acquired in the business combination_ As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated and consolidated and combined financial statements, on October 30, 2022, the Company entered into a Transaction Agreement with Emerson, BCP Emerald Aggregator L.P. (“BCP”) and Emerald Debt Merger Sub L.L.C. whereby BCP agreed to purchase, and Emerson agreed to sell, equity interests in JV NewCo following the Restructuring for a purchase price of $13,647.1 million. The acquisition was consummated on May 31, 2023. As of the date of the transaction, the Company recognized developed technology and trade name intangible assets acquired at provisional estimated fair values of $1,300.0 million and $880.0 million, respectively, which includes developed technology and trade name intangible assets related to the HVACR Technologies business unit. The Company determined the fair value of developed technology and trade name intangible assets using the relief from royalty methodology. We identified the valuation of developed technology and trade name intangible assets related to the HVACR Technologies business unit as a critical audit matter. We performed a sensitivity analysis to determine which assumptions used by management most significantly impacted the fair value of the developed technology and trade name intangible assets. A high degree of subjective auditor judgement was required to evaluate certain assumptions used in the valuation of the developed technology and trade name intangible assets, specifically the revenue growth rates. Additionally, evaluating the discount rates, royalty rates, as well as the obsolescence factor as it relates to the valuation of the developed technology intangible asset, required the involvement of valuation professionals with specialized skills. Changes in these assumptions could have had a significant impact on the fair value of the HVACR Technologies business unit developed technology and trade name intangible assets. The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design of certain internal controls related to the Company’s acquisition date valuation process, including controls related to the development of the revenue growth rates, royalty rates, and the obsolescence factor assumptions. We evaluated the revenue growth rates by comparing them to the historical financial results of the acquired business and historical financial results and projections of certain peer companies. We involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in: - evaluating the discount rates by comparing them to independently developed ranges of the weighted average cost of capital and the weighted average return on assets, and recomputing the discount rates ----- - evaluating the royalty rates against comparable licensing agreements - evaluating the obsolescence factor by comparing it to implied annual obsolescence rates in similar transactions in the Company’s industry. We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2022. Columbus, Ohio January 26, 2024 ----- ### Consolidated Statements of Operations EMERALD JV HOLDINGS L.P.

(Dollars in millions, except where noted) #### (1) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Description of Business Emerald JV Holdings L.P. (“Emerald,” “JV NewCo,” or the “Company”) is a leading provider of compression technologies, electronics and controls products, as well as components, software and solutions that broadly serve applications across the Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning and Refrigeration (“HVACR”) and Industrial industries. The Company's businesses are primarily organized by product offering. The Company's products are organized into two broad categories - HVACR Technologies and Electronics and Controls (which includes the Cold Chain and Comfort Control technologies). The served applications include, among others, heating and cooling including heat pump applications, food service / retail / industrial refrigeration, perishable goods, transportation, healthcare / life sciences, and renewable energy. The Company’s compression technologies enable higher efficiency in commercial and residential HVAC units, as well as in commercial and industrial refrigeration units. The Company also has a solution portfolio that manages, monitors and controls refrigeration units in the commercial setting, as well as software solutions that measure and monitor temperature conditions of refrigerated goods in transit. The Company’s industrial products are designed into renewable energy processes including RNG and Biogas applications. In general, the company’s technologies and solutions address global trends, including i. the decarbonization and increased energy efficiency of heating, cooling, refrigeration, and industrial processes, ii. the drive towards lower-GWP refrigerants, and iii. the efficient transport of perishable goods including food and medicine. The Company now operates under the Copeland brand, as well as the Sensi, Verdant, Vilter and White-Rodgers sub-brands. Emerald JV Holdings L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, was formed by Emerson Electric Co. (“Emerson”), to hold its Climate Technologies Business (“Climate Technologies”) in connection with the acquisition of a majority stake in Climate Technologies (the “Acquisition”) by certain investment funds affiliated with Blackstone Inc. (“Blackstone”). The Company currently holds Climate Technologies, after the completion of certain restructuring steps undertaken by Emerson to transfer Climate Technologies to JV NewCo (the “Restructuring”). As Emerald JV Holdings L.P. did not have any previous operations, Climate Technologies is viewed as the predecessor to the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries. Accordingly, these consolidated financial statements include certain historical consolidated financial and other data for Climate Technologies for periods prior to the completion of the Acquisition. Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation As a result of the Acquisition as further discussed in Note 2, periods prior to May 31, 2023 reflect the financial statements of Climate Technologies prior to the Acquisition (referred to herein as the “Predecessor” period). Periods subsequent to May 31, 2023 reflect the financial statements of the Company after the Acquisition (referred to herein as the “Successor” period). The Company’s assets and liabilities were adjusted to fair value on the closing date of the Acquisition. Due to the change in the basis of accounting, the consolidated and combined financial statements for the Predecessor and the consolidated financial statements for the Successor are not comparable. Where applicable, a “black line” separates the Successor and Predecessor periods to highlight the lack of comparability. The Successor Statement of Operations reflects the results of the business following the closing of the Acquisition. However, on May 19, 2023, Emerald Debt Merger Sub L.L.C (“Merger Sub”), a subsidiary of Emerald JV Holdings, L.P., and which was merged with and into EMRLD Borrower LP (“EMRLD Borrower”) on the Acquisition Date (as defined below), and Emerald Co-Issuer Inc., a direct subsidiary of Merger Sub, issued senior secured notes in the aggregate principal amount of $2,275.0 and aggregate principal amount of €455.0 (or $500.0 U.S. dollar equivalent, based on the exchange rate of approximately $1.10 per €1.00), the “Dollar Notes” and “Euro Notes”, respectively and collectively the “Notes”. The Company incurred $6.2 of interest ----- expense for the period from May 19, 2023 to May 31, 2023 related to the Notes (see Note 12 for further details), which has been recognized in the Successor period. This report includes historical consolidated financial statements and certain financial data of the Company in lieu of consolidated financial statements and financial data for EMRLD Borrower, the borrower under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the issuer of the Notes and the direct subsidiary of EMRLD Guarantor LP (“Holdings”). The Company does not have any material operating, investing, or financing activities other than being (i) the issuer of the Preferred Equity and (ii) a holding company for EMRLD Seller Notes Issuer LP (the “Emerson Notes Issuer”) and Holdings and its subsidiaries. Accordingly, with the exception of the Preferred Equity issued by the Company (see Note 15 for further details), and the Emerson Notes issued by the Emerson Notes Issuer (see Note 12 for further details), the consolidated Balance Sheet and results of operations of Holdings and its subsidiaries, including EMRLD Borrower, would be substantially identical to those of the Company and its subsidiaries for the periods for which financial information is presented in this report. Prior to the consummation of the Acquisition, Climate Technologies had historically operated as part of Emerson and not as a standalone entity. The consolidated and combined financial statements for the Predecessor period present the historical financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of the Company as if it had operated on a standalone basis subject to Emerson’s control and include all accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates on a consolidated basis. Intercompany transactions, profits and balances among Climate Technologies entities have been eliminated in consolidation. The Predecessor period consolidated and combined financial statements were derived from Emerson’s financial statements and accounting records and have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). Sale and purchase transactions between the Company and other Emerson affiliates are included in the consolidated financial statements. See Note 16 for further details. As a business of Emerson, during the Predecessor period, Climate Technologies was charged for costs directly related to the Company and has been allocated a portion of Emerson’s general corporate costs. These costs are reflected in the consolidated and combined financial statements. The Company participated in various Emerson programs which include information technology services, employee benefits, medical insurance, and other programs. Costs associated with these programs were charged to the Company based on Emerson’s actual cost and the Company’s relative level of usage. The Company also utilized Emerson’s global shared service centers and was charged for direct costs and its share of facilities overhead. Emerson provided certain oversight and support services, including assistance with management strategy, logistics, marketing, finance, treasury, tax, human resources, legal and other activities. Emerson also charged royalties for use of Emerson’s trademarks and trade names and supply chain services. A charge for these services and royalties was allocated to the Company based principally on revenue. While management believes the methodologies and assumptions used to allocate these costs were reasonable, the consolidated and combined financial statements for the Predecessor period do not purport to represent the financial position, or the results of operations, changes in equity, and cash flows of the Company for the Successor period or in the future, or what they would have been had the Company operated as a standalone entity during the Predecessor periods presented. The Company has applied the same accounting policies between Predecessor and Successor periods. Certain information has been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Use of Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses for the periods presented. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Foreign Currency The consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, which is the Company's reporting currency. The functional currency for the Company's operations in Mexico, Argentina, Thailand, Hong Kong, Denmark, and the majority in the Middle East is U.S. dollars while most other non-U.S. operations use the local currency. ----- Adjustments resulting from translating local currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies are subject to changes in exchange rates with resulting gains/losses recorded in net earnings. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. Our short-term investments are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient, and therefore, are not classified in the fair value hierarchy. Our cash held in banks is measured in the fair value hierarchy using Level 1 inputs. Receivables and Allowance for Credit Losses Receivables are shown net of allowance for credit losses. The Company monitors customer-specific payment and write-off history as well as forward-looking trends and macro-economic factors to estimate an allowance for credit losses. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value and are valued based on standard costs which approximate average costs. Cost standards are revised at the beginning of each fiscal year. The annual effect of resetting standards plus operating variances incurred during each period are allocated between inventories and recognized in cost of sales as products are sold. Property, Plant and Equipment The Company records investments in land, buildings, and machinery and equipment at cost. Depreciation is computed principally using the straight-line method over estimated service lives, which for principal assets are 30 to 40 years for buildings and 10 to 12 years for machinery and equipment. Long-lived tangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Impairment losses, if any, are recognized based on estimated fair values if the sum of expected future undiscounted cash flows of the related assets is less than the carrying values. Costs of software developed for internal use are accounted for in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Subtopic 350-40, Internal-Use Software. Capitalized internal use software and the related accumulated amortization have been classified on the consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2023 (Successor) and the consolidated and combined Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2022 (Predecessor) have been reclassified from Other intangible assets to Property, plant and equipment, net to more closely align these net assets with the category of the assets they represent. Goodwill and Other Intangibles Assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method and recorded at their respective fair values. Goodwill represents the excess of consideration paid over total fair value of the net assets acquired. The Company conducts its annual impairment test of goodwill, typically in the fourth quarter, and between tests if events or circumstances indicate a reporting unit's fair value may be less than its carrying value. If an initial assessment indicates it is more likely than not goodwill might be impaired, it is evaluated by comparing the reporting unit's estimated fair value to its carrying value. An impairment charge would be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. Estimated fair values are developed primarily under an income approach that discounts estimated future cash flows using risk adjusted interest rates, as well as market approaches such as earnings multiples or other techniques as warranted. Fair values are subject to changes in underlying economic conditions. All of the Company's identifiable intangible assets are subject to amortization on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Identifiable intangible assets consist of intellectual property, customer relationships, ----- developed technology, trade name, and backlog and are also subject to evaluation for potential impairment if events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. No goodwill or intangible asset impairment was recorded for any of the periods presented. Leases As the lessee The Company leases offices, manufacturing facilities and equipment, and transportation, information technology, and office equipment primarily under operating lease arrangements. The Company determines whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease at contract inception. An arrangement contains a lease if the Company has the right to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the economic benefits of an identified asset. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at lease commencement based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recognized on the Balance Sheet and are recorded as short-term lease expenses. The discount rate used to calculate present value is the Company's incremental borrowing rate based on the lease term and the economic environment of the applicable country or region. Certain leases have renewal options or options to terminate prior to lease expiration, which are included in the measurement of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities when it is reasonably certain they will be exercised. The Company has elected to account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for its offices and manufacturing facilities. Some lease arrangements include payments that are adjusted periodically based on actual charges incurred for common area maintenance, utilities, taxes and insurance, or changes in an index or rate referenced in the lease. The fixed portion of these payments is included in the measurement of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities at lease commencement, while the variable portion is recorded as variable lease expense. The Company's leases do not contain material residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants. As the lessor The Company is a lessor in arrangements to lease certain properties. As a lessor, the Company’s leases are classified as operating leases under ASC 842 and accounted for as operating leases. The underlying asset in an operating lease is carried at depreciated cost and is included in Property, plant and equipment, net. The company has elected to account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. Variable lease payments, if any, are recognized as income in the period received. Rental income from operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Lease income is recognized as an offset to selling, general and administrative expenses, within the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the Successor period. Noncontrolling Interests in a Subsidiary The Company holds a 51% controlling financial interest in Alliance Compressors LLC (""Alliance"") and therefore, the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of Alliance have been included in the Company's consolidated financial statements. The remaining 49% interest in Alliance are accounted for as noncontrolling interests in subsidiary in the Company's consolidated financial statements. Net Parent Investment The net parent investment balance included in the consolidated and combined Predecessor Balance Sheet represents Emerson’s historical investment in the Company, the Company’s accumulated net earnings after income taxes, and the net effect of the transactions with Emerson. ----- Revenue Recognition In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, the Company evaluates its contracts with customers to identify the promised goods or services and recognize revenue for the identified performance obligations at the amount the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to a customer. Revenue is recognized when, or as performance obligations are satisfied, and control has transferred to the customer, typically when products are shipped or delivered, title and risk of loss pass to the customer, and the Company has a present right to payment. The vast majority of the Company's revenues are performance obligations related to the sale of manufactured products which are recognized at a point in time when control transfers in accordance with shipping terms. In limited circumstances, contracts include multiple performance obligations, where revenue is recognized separately for each good or service, as well as contracts where revenue is recognized over time as control transfers to the customer. For revenues recognized over time, the Company typically uses an input method to determine progress and recognize revenue, based on costs incurred. The Company believes costs incurred closely correspond with its performance under the contract and the transfer of control to the customer. In sales arrangements that involve multiple performance obligations, revenue is allocated based on the relative standalone selling price for each performance obligation. Observable selling prices from actual transactions are used whenever possible. In other instances, the Company determines the standalone selling price based on third-party pricing or management's best estimate. Payment terms vary but are generally short-term in nature. The Company's long-term contracts, where revenue is generally recognized over time, are billed as work progresses in accordance with the contract terms and conditions, either at periodic intervals or upon achievement of certain milestones. The timing of revenue recognition and billings under these contracts results in either unbilled receivables (contract assets) when revenue recognized exceeds billings, or customer advances (contract liabilities) when billings exceed revenue recognized. Unbilled receivables are reclassified to accounts receivable when an unconditional right to consideration exists, typically when a milestone in the contract is achieved. The Company does not evaluate whether the transaction price includes a significant financing component for contracts where the time between cash collection and performance is less than one year. Certain arrangements with customers include variable consideration, typically in the form of rebates, cash discounts or penalties. Other than standard product warranty provisions, sales arrangements provide no other post shipment obligations on the Company. In most instances, returns are limited to product quality issues. The Company records a reduction to revenue at the time of sale to reflect the ultimate amount of consideration it expects to receive. The Company's estimates are updated quarterly based on historical experience, trend analysis, and expected market conditions. Variable consideration is typically not constrained at the time revenue is recognized. The Company records amounts billed to customers for the costs of shipping and handling in sales transactions as revenue and such costs are not considered separate performance obligations. Shipping and handling costs incurred by the Company to deliver products to customers were $9.9, $20.6, and $35.5 for the four months ended September 30, 2023 (Successor), eight months ended May 31, 2023 (Predecessor) and year ended September 30, 2022 (Predecessor), respectively, and were reported in selling, general and administrative expenses. Interest (Expense) Income, Net Interest income and expense are recognized in the consolidated Statement of Operations line Interest (expense) income, net, when earned or incurred, on an accrual basis using the effective interest rate method. The effective interest rate method is an approach to calculating the amortized cost of a financial asset or financial liability using the effective interest rate. The effective interest rate is used to discount estimated future cash payments or receipts as of the maturity date to the present value. Interest expense consists of interest ----- incurred on debt issued in the Successor period (see Note 12 for further details). In the Predecessor period, interest income consisted of interest earned on a note receivable Climate Technologies made to a subsidiary of Emerson (see Note 16 for further details). In the Successor period, the Company earned $1.1 of interest income on deposits. Warranty Warranties largely provide assurance that the product will function as intended and generally extend for a period of one to two years from the date of sale. Warranties vary by product line and are competitive for the markets in which the Company operates. Provisions for warranty expense are estimated at the time of sale based on historical experience and adjusted quarterly for any known issues that may arise. The changes in product warranty liabilities are as follows: Successor Total warranty liability as of June 1, 2023 $ 40.5 Payments made (9.8) Changes resulting from issuance of new warranties 11.7 Changes in estimates associated with pre-existing liabilities (0.1) Changes in foreign currency translation rates and other (0.2) Total warranty liability as of September 30, 2023 $ 42.1 Predecessor Total warranty liability as of October 1, 2021 $ 35.1 Payments made (23.4) Changes resulting from issuance of new warranties 31.0 Changes in estimates associated with pre-existing liabilities (1.4) Changes in foreign currency translation rates and other (1.1) Total warranty liability as of September 30, 2022 $ 40.2 Payments made (16.1) Changes resulting from issuance of new warranties 18.4 Changes in estimates associated with pre-existing liabilities (2.6) Changes in foreign currency translation rates and other 0.6 Total warranty liability as of May 31, 2023 $ 40.5 Supplier Finance Program In the Successor period, the Company facilitates a voluntary supplier finance program (the ""Program"") to provide certain suppliers with the opportunity to sell receivables due from the Company to the participating financial institution in the Program. Such sales are conducted at the sole discretion of both the suppliers and the financial institution on a non-recourse basis at a rate that leverages the Company's credit rating and thus might be more beneficial to the supplier. The Company's responsibility is limited to making payment on the terms originally negotiated with its suppliers, regardless of whether the suppliers sell their receivables to the financial institution. The amount owed to the participating financial institution under the Program and included in accounts payable was $92.3 at September 30, 2023. In the Predecessor period, Emerson facilitated a similar program with a balance of $170.8 at September 30, 2022. Fair Value Measurement ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement, establishes a formal hierarchy and framework for measuring certain financial statement items at fair value, and requires disclosures about fair value measurements and the reliability of valuation inputs. Under ASC 820, measurement assumes the transaction to sell an asset or transfer a liability occurs in the principal or at least the most advantageous market for that asset or liability. Within the hierarchy, Level 1 instruments use observable market prices for the identical item in active markets and have the most ----- reliable valuations. Level 2 instruments are valued through broker/dealer quotation or through marketobservable inputs for similar items in active markets, including forward and spot prices, interest rates and volatilities. Level 3 instruments are valued using inputs not observable in an active market, such as companydeveloped future cash flows, and are considered the least reliable. Valuations for all the Company's financial instruments, identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the Acquisition, Emerson Notes, and Preferred Equity Class P Units fall within Level 2. Carrying value approximates fair value for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The Company's foreign currency exposures relate to transactions denominated in currencies that differ from the functional currencies of its subsidiaries, principally Mexican pesos. Foreign exchange forwards are utilized, as needed, to hedge foreign currency exposures impacting earnings, firm commitments, or the fair value of assets and liabilities. Commodity exposures are price fluctuations on forecasted purchases of copper and aluminum. All derivatives are associated with specific underlying exposures and the Company does not hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. The initial duration of hedge positions is generally less than two years. All derivatives are accounted for under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and recognized at fair value. For derivatives hedging variability in future cash flows, any gain or loss is deferred in equity and recognized when the underlying hedged transaction impacts earnings. The Company's foreign currency derivatives and most commodity derivatives qualify for hedge accounting. Gains or losses on derivative instruments that do not receive hedge accounting treatment under ASC 815 are recognized in the income statement immediately. Income Taxes Prior to the Acquisition (Predecessor period), the Company's operations were historically included in Emerson's combined U.S. and non-U.S. income tax returns in most locations. Effective on the date of the Acquisition (Successor period), substantially all U.S. operations are effectively owned by an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. tax purposes, which is not subject to U.S. income tax. Income tax expense included in the financial statements has been calculated following the separate return method, which applies ASC 740, Income Taxes, as if the Company was a stand-alone enterprise and a separate taxpayer for the periods presented. The calculation of income taxes on a separate return basis requires considerable judgment and the use of both estimates and allocations that affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expenses. As a result, the Company's deferred income tax rate and deferred tax balances may differ from those in Emerson's historical results. The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of ASC 740. Under this approach, deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. Deferred taxes result from differences between the financial statement and tax basis of the Company's assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted rates in effect for the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. The tax carryforwards reflected in the Company's consolidated and combined financial statements have been determined using the separate return method. The complexity of tax regulations requires assessments of uncertainties in estimating taxes the Company will ultimately pay. The Company recognizes liabilities for anticipated tax audit uncertainties in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether, and the extent to which additional taxes would be due on a separate return basis. Tax liabilities are presented net of any related tax loss carryforwards. The Company also provides for income taxes, net of any potentially available foreign tax credits, on earnings intended to be repatriated from foreign subsidiaries. The undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of ----- September 30, 2023 are considered permanently invested or otherwise indefinitely retained for continuing international operations. Recognition of income taxes on undistributed foreign earnings, if any, would be triggered by a decision to repatriate earnings. Determination of the amount of taxes that might be paid on any undistributed earnings if eventually remitted is not practicable. Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Effective October 1, 2021, the Company adopted three accounting standard updates which had an immaterial or no impact on the Company’s financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2022. These included: - Updates to ASC 805, Business Combinations, which clarify the accounting for contract assets and liabilities assumed in a business combination. In general, this will result in contract liabilities being recognized at their historical amounts under ASC 606, rather than at fair value in accordance with the general requirements of ASC 805. - Updates to ASC 740, Income Taxes, which require the recognition of a franchise tax that is partially based on income as an income-based tax with any incremental amount as a non-income-based tax. These updates also make certain changes to intra-period tax allocation principles and interim tax calculations. - Updates to ASC 321, Equity Securities, ASC 323, Investments – Equity Method and Joint Ventures, and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, which clarify how to account for the transition into and out of the equity method of accounting when evaluating observable transactions. #### (2) BUSINESS COMBINATIONS On October 30, 2022, the Company entered into a Transaction Agreement (“Transaction Agreement”) with Emerson, BCP Emerald Aggregator L.P. (“BCP”) and Merger Sub whereby BCP agreed to purchase, and Emerson agreed to sell, equity interests in JV NewCo following the Restructuring, for a purchase price of $13,647.1, as detailed below. The Acquisition was consummated on May 31, 2023 (the “Acquisition Date”). The Acquisition is accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting which requires, among other things, that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their estimated fair values (based on Level 3 measurements) as of the Acquisition Date. Additional information existing as of the Acquisition Date, but unknown to us, may become known during the remainder of the measurement period, not to exceed 12 months from the Acquisition Date, which may result in changes to the purchase price allocation. The following tables summarize the purchase consideration and the provisional purchase price allocation to estimated fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The preliminary calculation of the total consideration and allocation of the purchase price to the fair value of the Company’s assets acquired and liabilities assumed has not been completed. The detailed valuations necessary to estimate the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and, accordingly, the adjustments to record the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value reflects the best estimates based on the information currently available and are subject to change once additional analyses are completed. Debt proceeds paid to sellers, net of fees $ 5,167.1 Issued ownership interest in the Company (Preferred) 2,981.0 Issued ownership interest in the Company (Common) 3,396.7 Issuance of debt to an affiliate of the Emerson (“Emerson Notes”) 2,052.3 Cash paid for seller’s transactions expenses 50.0 Total purchase consideration $ 13,647.1 ----- Provisional purchase price allocation $ 13,647.1 Non-controlling interest in subsidiary 216.0 Total to allocate 13,863.1 Less: fair value of net assets acquired and liabilities assumed Cash and equivalents 118.3 Receivables, net of allowance for credit losses 800.1 Note receivable from related party 947.3 Inventories 600.7 Other current assets 75.5 Property, plant and equipment, net 1,828.1 Other intangible assets 6,582.0 Deferred tax assets 17.8 Other long-term assets 150.1 Accounts payable (709.5) Note payable to related party (947.3) Accrued expenses (520.9) Income taxes payable (38.1) Deferred tax liabilities (652.4) Other long-term liabilities (204.8) Net assets acquired 8,046.9 Goodwill $ 5,816.2 Goodwill is primarily attributable to assembled workforce, expected synergies, and other factors. Goodwill is generally not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. The fair values of the identifiable intangible assets acquired at the Acquisition Date are as follows: Acquisition Date Weighted-Average Useful Fair Value Life (Years) Customer relationships $ 4,250.0 12.88 Developed technology 1,300.0 7.85 Trade name 880.0 12.03 Backlog 152.0 0.25 Total identifiable intangible assets acquired $ 6,582.0 The fair values of our trade name and developed technology were determined using relief from royalty methodology. The fair values of our customer relationships and backlog were determined using multi-period excess earnings methodology. The valuations of intangible assets incorporate significant unobservable inputs and require significant judgment and estimates, including the amount and timing of future cash flows. Customer relationships, developed technology, trade name and backlog are amortized over the respective useful lives and the expense is recorded in the amortization of intangibles financial statement line item within the consolidated Statement of Operations. The Company recognized $147.8 of transaction expenses related to the Acquisition, including $50.0 related to due-diligence costs, legal fees, and advisor charges; $52.0 related to a breakage fee from alternative standby debt financing; $25.2 related to buyer stand-up costs, and $20.5 related to the rights and warranty insurance policy. These costs are recorded in the Transaction and separation-related expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. |Customer relationships $ 4,250.0|12.88| |---|---| |Total identifiable intangible assets acquired $ 6,582.0|Col2| |---|---| ----- #### (3) REVENUE RECOGNITION The following table summarizes the balances of the Company’s unbilled receivables (contract assets), which are reported in other current assets, and its customer advances (contract liabilities), which are reported in accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities. Successor Predecessor Sep 30, 2023 Sep 30, 2022 Unbilled receivables (contract assets) $ 10.9 8.9 Customer advances (contract liabilities) (136.3) (102.6) Net contract liabilities $ (125.4) (93.7) The majority of the Company’s contract balances relate to arrangements where revenue is recognized over time and payments from customers are made according to a contractual billing schedule. The increase in net contract liabilities was due to customer advances which exceeded revenue recognized for performance completed during the period. Revenue recognized for the four months ended September 30, 2023 (Successor) and eight months ended May 31, 2023 (Predecessor) of approximately $9.3 and $69.0, respectively, was included in the beginning contract liability balance. Revenue recognized for the four months ended September 30, 2023 (Successor) and eight months ended May 31, 2023 (Predecessor) for performance obligations that were satisfied in previous periods, including cumulative catchup adjustments on the Company’s long-term contracts, was not material. Capitalized amounts related to incremental costs to obtain customer contracts and costs to fulfill contracts are immaterial.

This results in an effective tax rate for the Successor period that is significantly lower than the Predecessor periods, because in such prior periods the U.S. operations were owned by an entity treated as a corporation for U.S. tax purposes, and thus were subject to U.S. income tax. |Successor Four months ended Sep 30, 2023|Col2|Predecessor Eight months Year ended ended May 31, Sep 30, 2022 2023|Col4| |---|---|---|---| |United States $ (363.5)||378.1|649.1| |Non-U.S. (62.6)||235.8 284.8|| |Total earnings before income taxes $ (426.1)||613.9|933.9| |Successor Four months ended Sep 30, 2023|Col2|Predecessor Eight months Year ended ended May 31, Sep 30, 2022 2023| |---|---|---| |Current:||| |Federal 1.7||118.0 119.4 12.9 13.5| |State and local 0.1 Non-U.S. 25.5||| |||64.9 61.6| |Deferred:||| |||(16.3) (1.6)| |Federal (0.4) State and local 0.0||| |||(1.7) 0.6 (5.1) (0.1)| |Non-U.S. (50.2)||| ----- Reconciliation of U.S. federal statutory taxes to the Company’s total income tax expense follows: Successor Predecessor Four months Eight months Year ended ended Sep 30, ended May 31, Sep 30, 2022 2023 2023 Taxes at U.S. statutory rate (21%) 21.0% 21.0% 21.0% Federal pass-through of U.S. partnership (18.2) 0.0 0.0 State and local taxes, net of U.S. federal (0.0) 1.4 1.2 tax benefit Rate differential on international 1.4 4.5 1.3 operations, net FDII 0.0 (1.8) (1.0) Provision to return adjustments 0.0 3.0 0.0 Other 1.3 0.1 (1.8) Total effective income tax rate 5.5% 28.2% 20.7% Non-U.S. tax holidays reduce tax rates in certain jurisdictions including China and are expected to expire in the next one to three years.

As of September 30, 2023, and 2022, total accrued interest and penalties were $1.2 and $3.1, respectively. The U.S. is a significant jurisdiction for which the Company files income tax returns; the initial U.S. partnership tax return will be filed in early 2024. Potential audit adjustments for tax years the Company was owned by Emerson are indemnified under the transaction agreement. The status of other significant tax returns varies due to the numerous legal entities and jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Uncertain tax positions and deferred tax balances assumed in connection with the transaction are initially estimated as of the transaction date. The Company reevaluates these items based upon the facts and circumstances that existed as of the transaction date, with any adjustments to its preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill, provided that the Company is within the measurement period. |Successor Four months ended Sep 30, 2023|Col2|Predecessor Eight months Year ended ended May 31, Sep 30, 2022 2023|Col4| |---|---|---|---| |Taxes at U.S. statutory rate (21%) 21.0%||21.0%|21.0%| |Federal pass-through of U.S. partnership (18.2)||0.0 0.0 1.4 1.2|| |State and local taxes, net of U.S. federal (0.0) tax benefit Rate differential on international 1.4 operations, net|||| |||4.5 1.3 (1.8) (1.0)|| |FDII 0.0 Provision to return adjustments 0.0|||| |||3.0 0.0 0.1 (1.8)|| |Other 1.3|||| |Successor Four months ended Sep 30, 2023|Col2|Predecessor Eight months Year ended ended May 31, Sep 30, 2022 2023|Col4| |---|---|---|---| |Beginning balance $ 14.1|||13.5 13.4| |Additions for current year tax positions 0.5||1.4 2.0 0.0 0.0|| |Additions for prior year tax positions 0.0 Reductions for prior year tax positions 0.0|||| |||(0.8) (0.8) 0.0 (1.1)|| |Reductions for expirations of statute of 0.0 limitations Ending balance $ 14.6|||| |||14.1 13.5|| ----- Successor Predecessor Sep 30, 2023 Sep 30, 2022 Deferred tax assets: Net operating losses and tax credits $ 8.1 7.3 Accrued liabilities 9.8 28.2 Employee compensation and benefits 10.0 22.9 Other 3.3 9.8 Total deferred tax assets $ 31.2 68.2 Valuation allowances (2.5) (3.4) Total deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances $ 28.7 64.8 Deferred tax liabilities: Intangibles $ (516.6) (32.3) Property, plant and equipment (97.0) (50.9) Other (0.8) — Total deferred tax liabilities $ (614.4) (83.2) Net deferred income tax liability $ (585.7) (18.4) Total income taxes paid were approximately $27.4, $150.1, and $192.0 in the four months ended September 30, 2023 (Successor), eight months ended May 31, 2023 (Predecessor) and year ended 2022 (Predecessor), respectively.

Based on intangible asset balances as of September 30, 2023, expected amortization expense is $572.4 for each of the next five years. #### (10) FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Hedging Activities The Company is exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Foreign currency forward contracts are utilized, as need, to hedge foreign currency exposures impacting earnings, firm commitments, or the fair value of assets and liabilities. As of September 30, 2023 (Successor), the notional amount of foreign currency hedge positions was $423.5. The Company also hedges its exposure to commodity price fluctuations of copper and aluminum. Commodity derivatives totaled approximately $137.5 (35.8 pounds) for copper and $7.2 (6.8 pounds) for aluminum. All foreign currency forward contracts and the majority of commodity derivatives are cash flow hedges and receive hedge accounting treatment. A small percentage of the aluminum commodity derivatives do not receive hedge accounting treatment and are marked to market through other income (expense). The majority of the unrealized gains and losses deferred in other comprehensive income (“OCI”) as of September 30, 2023 (Successor) are expected to be recognized over the next twelve months as the underlying transactions occur. The following gains and losses are included in earnings and OCI: Into Earnings Successor Predecessor Four months Eight months Year ended ended Sep 30, ended May 31, |Gross carrying amount $ 4,221.9|1,291.2|874.0 152.0 6,539.1| |---|---|---| |Net carrying amount $ 4,112.8|1,235.6|848.3 — 6,196.7| |---|---|---| |Col1|Col2|Into Earnings|Col4| |---|---|---|---| |Successor Four months ended Sep 30, 2023||Predecessor Eight months Year ended ended May 31, Sep 30, 2022 2023|| |Commodity Cost of sales $ (3.3)||(9.9)|11.7| |Other (expense) — Commodity income, net||0.0 (0.3) 15.8 17.4 0.1 —|| |Foreign currency Cost of sales 12.5 Other (expense) (0.1) Foreign currency income, net|||| |Total $ 9.1||6.0|28.8| ----- Into OCI Successor Predecessor Four months Eight months Year ended ended Sep 30, ended May 31, Sep 30, 2022 2023 2023 Commodity Cost of sales $ 3.2 6.2 (20.1) Other (expense) — 0.0 — Commodity income, net Foreign currency Cost of sales 10.7 27.0 28.6 Total $ 13.9 33.2 8.5 Regardless of whether derivatives receive hedge accounting, the Company expects hedging gains or losses to be offset by losses or gains on the related underlying exposures. The amounts ultimately recognized will differ from those presented above for open positions, which remain subject to ongoing market price fluctuations until settlement. Derivatives receiving hedge accounting are highly effective and no amounts were excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. Fair Value Measurement Valuations for all derivatives fall within Level 2 of the GAAP valuation hierarchy.

The effective interest rates for the Dollar Notes and Euro Notes as of September 30, 2023, were 6.855% and 6.567%, respectively. Principal on both the Dollar Notes and Euro Notes will be payable upon maturity. In connection with the Dollar Notes and Euro Notes, the Company incurred and paid debt issuance costs of $36.5, which was capitalized and is amortized over the term of the Dollar and Euro Notes. ABL Credit Agreement On May 31, 2023, the Merger Sub entered into a credit agreement (the “ABL Credit Agreement”). Upon consummation of the Acquisition on the Closing Date, Merger Sub merged with and into EMRLD Borrower with EMRLD Borrower surviving such merger. The ABL Credit Agreement provides the Company with access to an up to $700.0 senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility” and, together with the Term Loan Facilities, the “Senior Secured Credit Facilities”). In connection with the Revolving Credit Facility, the Company incurred and paid debt issuance costs of $21.5, which was capitalized in other assets and is amortized over the term of the Revolving Credit Facility. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at Term SOFR Rate plus a margin of between 1.5% and 2.0% per annum (based on the Borrower’s average excess availability), subject to a Term SOFR Rate floor of 0.00%. The Revolving Credit Facility also requires a commitment fee of between 0.25% and 0.375% per annum (based on average daily revolving credit exposure) on undrawn commitments to be paid quarterly in arrears. The Revolving Credit Facility terminates on May 31, 2028. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had total capacity and available capacity of $397.3 and $293.4, respectively, under the Revolving Credit Facility. The debt agreements governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Notes described above contain covenants requiring compliance with, and govern among other things, restrictions on additional borrowings, investments (including acquisitions) and distributions. As of September 30, 2023, and at all times during the period, the Company was in compliance with its debt covenants. Emerson Notes On May 31, 2023, the Emerson Notes Issuer, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, issued two unsecured notes, the Emerson Notes, to EMR Holdings, Inc., an affiliate of Emerson, in the aggregate amount of $2,250.0. The Emerson Notes will mature on May 31, 2033. No debt issuance costs were incurred associated with the issuance of the Emerson Notes. The Emerson Notes include provisions for the payment of interest on the outstanding principal amount by adding the interest to the unpaid principal amount, which is referred to as paid ----- in kind (“PIK”) interest. Interest compounds on a semi-annual basis. The stated interest rate of the Emerson Notes is 5% per annum and the effective rate as of September 30, 2023, is 5.944%. Upon a change of control, the Company is required to prepay the entire principal amount, plus accrued unpaid interest through the prepayment date without any premium or penalty. The Emerson Notes are structurally subordinated to the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Notes. Future maturities of long-term debt as of September 30, 2023, are as follows: Fiscal year ended 2024 $ 22.8 Fiscal year ended 2025 25.6 Fiscal year ended 2026 34.0 Fiscal year ended 2027 39.6 Fiscal year ended 2028 541.8 Thereafter [(1)] 8,606.1 Total [(1)] $ 9,269.9 (1) Included in Thereafter and Total are the Emerson Notes, including PIK over the term of the Emerson Notes as stated above. #### (13) PENSION & POSTRETIREMENT PLANS Most of the Company's employees participate in defined contribution plans, including 401(k), profit sharing, and other savings plans that provide retirement benefits. Total expenses related to employees participating in these plans were $5.2, $19.2, and $20.7 for the four months ended September 30, 2023 (Successor), eight months ended May 31, 2023 (Predecessor), and year ended September 30, 2022 (Predecessor), respectively. In addition, certain employees in the U.S., U.K., and other countries participate in Emerson defined benefit plans. The Company accounts for the cost of these plans as if it were a participant in a multiemployer plan. Costs charged to the Company related to Emerson defined benefit plans were based on specific actuarially determined service costs to Company employees. Total charges related to employees participating in these plans were $0, $7.6, and $13.4 for the four months ended September 30, 2023 (Successor), eight months ended May 31, 2023 (Predecessor), and year ended September 30, 2022 (Predecessor), respectively. Certain U.S. and non-U.S. employees participate in Company specific or statutorily required defined benefit plans. In general, the Company's policy is to fund these plans based on legal requirements, required benefit payments, and other factors. Below are the disclosures related to these defined benefit plans.

The expected return on plan assets assumption is determined by reviewing the investment returns of the plans for the past 10 years plus longer-term historical returns of an asset mix approximating the Company's asset allocation targets, and periodically comparing these returns to expectations of investment advisors and actuaries to determine whether long-term future returns are expected to differ significantly from the past. The Company's asset allocations at September 30, 2023 and 2022, and weighted-average target allocations follow: U.S. Plans Non-U.S. Plans Successor Predecessor Successor Predecessor Sep 30, Sep 30, Sep 30, Sep 30, 2023 2022 Target 2023 2022 Target Equity securities 43% 46% 45-50% 0% 0% 0% Debt securities 50% 49% 45-50% 1% 1% 1% Other 7% 5% 0-10% 99% 99% 99% Total 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% The primary objective for the investment of pension assets is to secure participant retirement benefits by earning a reasonable rate of return. Plan assets are invested consistent with the provisions of the prudence and diversification rules of ERISA and with a long-term investment horizon. The Company continuously monitors the value of assets by class and routinely rebalances to remain within target allocations. The equity strategy is to minimize concentrations of risk by investing primarily in a mix of companies that are diversified across geographies, market capitalization, style, sectors and industries worldwide. The approach for bonds emphasizes investment-grade corporate and government debt with maturities matching a portion of the longer duration pension liabilities. The bonds strategy also includes a high-yield element which is generally shorter in duration. For diversification, a small portion of U.S. plan assets is allocated to private equity partnerships and real asset fund investments, providing opportunities for above market returns. Leveraging techniques are not used and the use of derivatives in any fund is limited and inconsequential. The fair values of defined benefit plan assets as of September 30, organized by asset class and by the fair value hierarchy of ASC 820 as outlined in Note 1, follow. Investments valued based on the net asset value (NAV) of fund units held, as derived from the fair value of the underlying assets, are excluded from the fair value hierarchy.

International equites are comprised of companies domiciled in developed nations outside the U.S. Emerging market equities are comprised of companies domiciled in portions of Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America. Corporate bonds represent investment-grade debt of issuers primarily from the U.S. Government bonds include investmentgrade instruments issued by federal, state and local governments, primarily in the U.S. Other includes cash, interests in mixed asset funds investing in commodities, natural resources, agriculture, real estate and infrastructure funds, life insurance contracts (U.S.), and shares in certain general investment funds of financial institutions or insurance arrangements (non-U.S.) that typically ensure no market losses or provide for a small minimum return guarantee. Fair Value Hierarchy Categories Valuations of Level 1 assets for all classes are based on quoted closing market prices from the principal exchanges where the individual securities are traded. Cash is valued at cost, which approximates fair value. Debt securities categorized as Level 2 assets are generally valued based on independent broker/dealer bids or by comparison to other debt securities having similar durations, yields and credit ratings. Valuation techniques and inputs for these assets include discounted cash flow analysis, earnings multiple approaches, recent transactions, transfer restrictions, prevailing discount rates, volatilities, credit ratings and other factors. In the Other class, interests in mixed asset funds are Level 2, and U.S. life insurance contracts and non-U.S. general fund investments and insurance arrangements are Level 3. Investments measured at NAV are primarily nonexchange-traded commingled or collective funds where the underlying securities have observable prices available from active markets and typically provide liquidity daily or within a few days.

Long-Term Incentive Plan Under the terms of the LTIP, employees are granted awards (the “LTIP Awards”) that become payable upon meeting both a service condition (the “LTIP Service Condition”) and a liquidity event condition (the “LTIP Liquidity Condition”). Awards issued under the LTIP have a maximum contractual term of the earlier to occur of the date on which the vested award amount has been settled or 7 years. LTIP Awards are liability classified since they allow for settlement in cash at the option of the Company. Unit Incentive Plan The MIP allows for the issuance of up to 466,881,550 units. Under the terms of the MIP, employees are awarded stock options (“Options”) or Unit Appreciation Right awards (“UARs”). Awards issued under the MIP have a maximum contractual term of 10 years. Options under the MIP are equity classified. UARs are liability classified since they require settlement in cash. During the four-months ended September 30, 2023 (Successor), the Company granted share-based payment awards to its employees. Under the MIP, one half of the Options and UARs will vest in five (5) equal installments on the first through fifth anniversaries of the vesting commencement date, so long as the employee remains employed by the Company through the applicable vesting date (“Time-Vesting Units”). One half of the Options and UARs granted under the MIP may vest upon a liquidity event based on the extent that Blackstone Capital Partners VIII L.P. and its Affiliates (”Sponsor”) receives cash proceeds in respect of the Sponsor’s original investment in an amount that meets certain multiples on invested capital and internal rate of return hurdles subject to the recipient’s continued employment at the time the hurdles are met (“Performance-Vesting Units”). Additionally, with regard to the UARs, both the Time-Vesting Units and Performance-Vesting Units may only be exercised by an employee following a liquidity event. The Company has elected to recognize forfeitures of Options and UARs as they occur in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation – Stock Compensation. Options Compensation expense for the Time-Vesting Units is recognized on a straight-line basis over the five-year requisite service period. Performance-Vesting Units vest upon the achievement of certain liquidity events which are not considered probable until consummated and, as such, no compensation expense has been recognized. Share-based compensation expense for the four months ended September 30, 2023 (Successor) for the TimeVesting Options was $2.6 and was included in selling, general and administrative expenses. ----- A summary of the Options issued to employees of the Company, is as follows: Weighted Weighted Averaged Average Time Performance Exercise Exercise Price Vesting Vesting Price per per Units Units Time Vesting Performance Units Vesting Units Outstanding, May 31, 2023 — $ — — $ — Granted 95,397,563 0.34 95,397,563 0.27 Forfeited or expired 4,125,000 0.34 4,125,000 0.27 Unvested and outstanding, 91,272,563 $ 0.34 91,272,563 $ 0.27 September 30, 2023 The weighted average grant date fair value for Time Vesting Units and Performance Vesting Units awarded during the four months ended September 30, 2023, was $0.34 and $0.27, respectively. As of September 30, 2023, there was $28.4 of unamortized share-based compensation expense related to Time-Vesting Units which is expected to be recognized over a remaining weighted average period of 4.5 years. As of September 30, 2023, the unvested and outstanding Performance-Vesting Units were deemed not probable, with an aggregate value of $24.3 of unrecognized share-based compensation expense. Unit Appreciation Rights As all UARs granted may only be exercised by an employee following a liquidity event, and achievement of such liquidity events are not considered probable until consummated, the Company will not recognize expense for the UARs until the occurrence of a liquidity event.

Pricing Model Assumptions The fair market values of the Time-Based Units and Performance-Based Units as of the grant date were estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model that utilized significant assumptions, including a risk-free rate interest rate, expected volatility, expected life (in years), dividend rate, and discount for lack of marketability (“DLOM”).These assumptions were determined using the methods discussed below. - The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. constant maturity treasury yield curve. - The expected volatility is estimated based on the volatility analysis of comparable companies. - The expected life (in years) is based on management’s estimate of the term to achieve a liquidity ----- event. - The dividend rate is 0% because the Company does not expect for the foreseeable future to pay a dividend. - The DLOM, which is an amount of value in ownership interest of a security that is lost due to its absence of marketability. DLOM is often used not only to capture incremental rate of return that market participants may require for investing in an interest that is not marketable (such as restricted stock) but also to capture the incremental rate of return that market participants may require for investing in illiquid interests. Several quantitative methods have been developed to estimate the DLOM for privately held interests. The DLOM utilized in the Company’s pricing model is the Finnerty Model, which is a commonly used method for calculating DLOM. The range of assumptions used to determine the grant date fair value for the Time-Based Units and Performance-Based Units is as follows: Pricing Model Assumptions Risk-free interest rate 4.4% Expected volatility 55.0% Expected life (years) 5.0 Dividend rate 0.0% DLOM 25.0% Predecessor Period Share-based Compensation Certain employees of the Company participated in Emerson’s share-based compensation plans, which include performance shares and restricted stock units. Compensation expense was recognized based on the grant date fair value – or in the case of liability classified awards, the fair value at each reporting date – of the awards. Share-based compensation expense recognized for the eight months ended May 31, 2023 (Predecessor) and year ended September 30, 2022 (Predecessor) was $16.4 and $15.6, respectively. Expense in the eight months ended May 31, 2023 (Predecessor) period includes both historical vesting expense and acceleration of any remaining expense related to the historical Emerson awards due to the Acquisition. #### (15) EQUITY INTERESTS Partnership Interests in the Successor Period The consolidated statements of equity reflect the issuance of general partner’s interest and limited partners’ interest in connection of the Acquisition as detailed in Note 2. As of September 30, 2023, the Company has three main classes of units, General Partner Units, issued to the general partner (“General Partner”), and Class P Units and Common Units, issued to the limited partners (“Limited Partners”). As of the Acquisition Date, the Company estimated the value of the Class P and Class A Units (as defined below) using an option pricing model in a Contingent Claim Analysis (""CCA"") framework. A CCA allocates the total available proceeds to various classes of equity securities at an expected liquidity event in accordance to the rights and distribution preferences of the holders for a range of potential exit value outcomes. The assumptions used in the CCA model for the Class P and Class A Units were as follows: Dividend yield 0.0% Expected volatility (based on observed volatility for comparable companies) 55.0% Risk-free interest rate (based on US Constant Maturity Treasury Yield) 3.7% Expected time to liquidity event (in years) 5.0 General Partner Units The General Partner has the exclusive power and authority to manage and control the business and operations of the Company. The General Partner is authorized to create additional classes of equity units and can issue ----- an unlimited number of units of any class. As of September 30, 2023, the Company has a singular issued and outstanding unit of General Partner Units. Limited Partners’ Preferred Equity (Class P Units) Class P Units do not contain voting rights (subject to certain standard exceptions) but have priority with respect to rights on the distribution of assets and dividend upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation and dissolution. Class P Units accrete at an amount equal to 7% per annum. The holder of each Class P Unit has the option to, if permitted by the Class P majority holder, convert the units into Class A-1 Units to participate in tag-along rights of the General Partner LLC Agreement. In the occurrence of an initial public offering, if the price per share of common stock is greater than the Conversion Price, all outstanding Class P Units will automatically convert into an aggregate number of Class A-1 Units, determined by dividing the accreted amount of Class P Units by the Conversion Price (“Mandatory IPO Conversion”). If an initial public offering occurs but does not meet the conditions for Mandatory IPO Conversion, the class P majority holder can elect to have all of the Class P Units converted to Class A-1 Units in the same manner as if a Mandatory IPO Conversion occurs, or, alternatively, can elect to convert the Class P Units into a preferred security that pays interest at a 9% annual rate in cash, on the terms and conditions set forth in the Company’s limited partnership agreement. Upon a change in control or when the holder of Class P Unit elects to participate in tag-along rights, the Class P Units will automatically convert into Class A-1 Units in the amount equal to the greater of the accreted amount of Class P Units divided by the price per Class A-1 Unit or Conversion Price. The Company has 2.0 million Class P Units issued and outstanding as of September 30, 2023. Conversion Price The “Conversion Price” for the Class P Units will be calculated as the product of 1.10 and the common equity consideration in connection with the Acquisition divided by the number of Class A Units acquired by BCP Ruby Limited Partners. The initial and current Conversion Price for the Class P Units is $1.1 dollar per unit. The Conversion Price is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain anti-dilutive common stock events, including stock splits, the issuance of common stock dividends. Limited Partners’ Common Equity (Common Units) Common Units consist of Class A-1 Units and Class A-2 Units. The Class A-2 Units are issued to management and do not contain voting rights. Common Units rank subsequent to holders of Class P units in any distributions or dividends. As of September 30, 2023, the Company has approximately 4,201.9 million Class A-1 units and 2.0 million Class A-2 units issued and outstanding. Predecessor Period Equity Interests The net parent investment balance included in the consolidated and combined Balance Sheets represents Emerson’s historical investment in the Climate Technologies, the Climate Technologies’ accumulated net earnings after income taxes, and the net effect of transactions with Emerson. #### (16) RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS Related-Party Transactions in the Successor Period On May 31, 2023, the Emerson Notes Issuer issued the Emerson Notes to EMR Holdings, Inc., an affiliate of Emerson, in the aggregate amount of $2,250.0. See Note 12 for further details. Per the terms of the Transaction Agreement, the Company is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to enable an amount of cash, equal to 283.9 million CNY or approximately $38.9 as of September 30, 2023 (“China Holdover Cash”), net of the applicable withholding tax liability and other costs, to be repatriated to an entity of Emerson prior to September 30, 2024, which is included in Other long-term liabilities. In addition, per the terms of the Transaction Agreement, the Company has paid $45.0 of foreign cash to Emerson. ----- In connection with the Acquisition, the Company and Emerson entered into a transition services agreement to provide various support services, including human resource functions, information technology services, finance and accounting, and other certain services from Emerson personnel, and other transitional services. Costs incurred for Emerson-managed functions, including those through the transition services agreements, are as follows: Successor Four months ended Sep 30, 2023 Information technology $ 10.3 Shared services 17.6 Other corporate costs 55.1 Total $ 83.0 The Company had an immaterial amount of sales to and purchases from Emerson affiliates for the four months ended September 30, 2023 (Successor). Related-party amounts reported in the Balance Sheet are as follows: Successor Sept 30, 2023 Accounts receivable $ 1.3 Accounts payable $                    16.3 The Company also has certain related-party lease arrangements with Emerson, refer to Note 11 for further details. Related-Party Transactions in the Predecessor Period As a business of Emerson, Climate Technologies had charged for costs directly attributable to Climate Technologies and allocated a portion of Emerson’s general corporate costs. All these costs are reflected in the Climate Technologies’ consolidated financial statements in the Predecessor period. Management believes the methodologies and assumptions used to allocate costs to the Climate Technologies are reasonable. Emerson maintains a centralized information technology function that supports its business units. The services provided include application hosting, network support, network security, messaging and technology related services. Charges to Climate Technologies for these services were based on Emerson’s cost and Climate Technologies’ actual usage. Emerson administers a medical insurance program for its U.S. employees in which Climate Technologies participates and for which it records the cost of claims incurred each period. Climate Technologies participated in other Emerson programs including, but not limited to, workers’ compensation and general and product liability insurance. Other Emerson programs are charged to Climate Technologies based on costs incurred and usage. Climate Technologies utilized Emerson global shared service centers that host Company-dedicated resources providing customer facing support, engineering and back office financial services. Costs for these resources are charged directly to Climate Technologies, with the majority relating to employee compensation and benefits and the remaining portion relating to facility overhead. In addition, general corporate costs incurred by Emerson and trademark and tradename royalties and supply chain services are allocated to Climate Technologies primarily based on its proportionate share of Emerson’s total consolidated revenue and include the cost of support functions such as procurement, logistics, marketing, human resources, legal, finance, internal audit and other Emerson corporate functions. ----- Costs incurred for Emerson-managed functions are as follows: Predecessor Eight months ended Year ended Sep 30, May 31, 2023 2022 Information technology $ 25.5 30.3 Insurance / other services $ 18.9 34.9 Shared services $ 28.3 35.2 Corporate costs $ 44.7 75.0 Royalties and other services $ 19.8 33.6 Climate Technologies had sales to Emerson affiliates of $6.1 and $84.0 for the eight months ended May 31, 2023 (Predecessor) and year ended September 30, 2022 (Predecessor), respectively. The change in the Climate Technologies’ sales to Emerson affiliates is due to Emerson’s disposal of its InSinkErator business in October 2022. Climate Technologies had purchases from Emerson affiliates of $1.6 and $1.9 for the eight months ended May 31, 2023 (Predecessor), and year ended September 30, 2022 (Predecessor), respectively. Related-party amounts reported in the Balance Sheet are as follows: Predecessor Sept 30, 2022 Accounts receivable $ 29.9 Accounts payable $ 13.8 In December 2022, Climate Technologies loaned a subsidiary of Emerson $947.3, and borrowed $947.3 from another Emerson subsidiary, which are presented as note receivable from related party and note payable to related party on the consolidated and combined Balance Sheet, respectively. The note receivable bears interest at the 3-month Hong Kong Interbank CNH less 15 basis points with a minimum of 0.25%, while the note payable is non-interest bearing. Both the note receivable and the note payable were settled in cash concurrently as of June 30, 2023. Interest income of $1.5 and $11.0 for the four months ended September 30, 2023 (Successor) and for the eight months ended May 31, 2023 (Predecessor), respectively, was recorded in interest expense, net, on these notes. #### (17) CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS The Company is a party to a number of pending legal proceedings and claims, including those involving general and product liability (including asbestos), and other matters. The Company accrues for such liabilities when it is probable that future costs will be incurred, and such costs can be reasonably estimated. Accruals are based on developments to date; management's estimates of the outcomes of these matters; the Company's experience in contesting, litigating and settling similar matters; and any related insurance coverage. While the Company believes a material adverse impact is unlikely, it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of these matters. Given the inherent uncertainty of litigation, a remote possibility exists that a future development could have a material adverse impact on the Company. The Company engages an outside expert to develop an actuarial estimate of its expected costs to resolve all pending and future asbestos claims, including defense costs, as well as its related insurance receivable. The reserve for asbestos litigation, which is recorded on an undiscounted basis, was $53.8 and $17.8 and the insurance receivable was $26.3 and $16.6 as of September 30, 2023 (Successor) and September 30, 2022 (Predecessor), respectively. As part of the Transaction Agreement, Emerson has indemnified the Company for asbestos claims filed against the Company for up to 7 years after the Acquisition Date, up to a maximum of $75.0; with Emerson having the right to offset any such amount against the Emerson Notes. The Company anticipates the total amount of claims filed during the 7-year period will be $28.5 with a related insurance receivable of $10.0, and therefore an indemnification receivable equal to $18.5 has been recorded as of Acquisition Date and September 30, 2023. ----- The Company is also responsible for environmental remediation at various facilities presently or formerly operated by the Company. The environmental remediation liability is recorded based upon the best estimate of costs to be incurred in light of the progress made in determining the magnitude of remediation costs, the timing, and extent of remedial actions required by governmental authorities. The actual costs the Company will incur are dependent on final determination of contamination and required remedial action, negotiations with governmental authorities with respect to cleanup levels, changes in regulatory requirements, innovations in investigatory and remedial technologies, effectiveness of remedial technologies employed, the ability of other responsible parties to pay, and any insurance or other third-party recoveries. As of September 30, 2023 (Successor), the Company has recorded, on an undiscounted basis, a total liability of $16.6 for environmental remediation costs regarding these facilities. Approximately $3.7 and $12.9 was recorded in accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities, respectively. As of September 30, 2022 (Predecessor) the total liability was $14.3, approximately $3.0 and $11.3 was recorded in accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities, respectively. As of September 30, 2023 (Successor), there were no other known contingent liabilities (including guarantees and other claims) that management believes will be material in relation to the Company’s financial statements, nor were there any material commitments outside the normal course of business. #### (18) ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) Successor Predecessor Four months Eight months Year ended ended Sep 30, ended May 31, Sep 30, 2023 2023 2022 Foreign currency translation, beginning $ — (19.8) 22.5 Other comprehensive (loss) income (93.5) 18.9 (42.3) Foreign currency translation, ending $ (93.5) (0.9) (19.8) Pension, beginning $ — (2.1) (13.7) Amortization of deferred losses (gains) into earnings, net of — (1.0) 1.3 income taxes of $—, $(0.2), and $(0.6), respectively Actuarial gains deferred during the period, net of income taxes 5.0 — 10.3 of: $—, $—, and $(4.5), respectively Pension, ending $ 5.0 (3.1) (2.1) Cash flow hedges, beginning $ — (6.2) 10.6 Gains deferred during the period, net of income taxes of $—, 13.9 29.5 6.3 $(7.7) and $(2.2), respectively Reclassification of (gains) losses to cost of sales, net of income (9.2) (4.7) (23.1) taxes of $—, $1.2 and $6.0, respectively Cash flow hedges, ending $ 4.7 18.6 (6.2) Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) $ (83.8) 14.6 (28.1) #### (19) OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION Significant items reported in accrued expenses include the following: Successor Predecessor Sep 30, 2023 Sep 30, 2022 Salaries and other employee compensation $ 84.7 78.9 Advance payments contract liabilities 104.4 44.9 Customer rebates and quantity discounts 64.8 67.2 Research and development expense reported in earnings was $66.2, $127.2, and $182.4 during the four months ended September 30, 2023 (Successor), eight months ended May 31, 2023 (Predecessor), and year ended September 30, 2022 (Predecessor). |Successor Four months ended Sep 30, 2023|Predecessor Eight months Year ended ended May 31, Sep 30, 2023 2022| |---|---| |Foreign currency translation, beginning $ —|(19.8) 22.5| |Other comprehensive (loss) income (93.5)|18.9 (42.3)| |Foreign currency translation, ending $ (93.5)|(0.9) (19.8)| ||(2.1) (13.7)| |Pension, beginning $ — Amortization of deferred losses (gains) into earnings, net of — income taxes of $—, $(0.2), and $(0.6), respectively|| ||(1.0) 1.3 — 10.3| |Actuarial gains deferred during the period, net of income taxes 5.0 of: $—, $—, and $(4.5), respectively Pension, ending $ 5.0|| ||(3.1) (2.1)| ||| |Cash flow hedges, beginning $ —|(6.2) 10.6 29.5 6.3| |Gains deferred during the period, net of income taxes of $—, 13.9 $(7.7) and $(2.2), respectively Reclassification of (gains) losses to cost of sales, net of income (9.2) taxes of $—, $1.2 and $6.0, respectively|| ||(4.7) (23.1)| |Cash flow hedges, ending $ 4.7|18.6 (6.2)| |Successor Sep 30, 2023|Col2|Predecessor Sep 30, 2022| |---|---|---| |Salaries and other employee compensation $ 84.7||78.9| |Advance payments contract liabilities 104.4||44.9| |Customer rebates and quantity discounts 64.8||67.2| ----- #### (20) SUBSEQUENT EVENTS The Company has evaluated subsequent events through January 26, 2024, which is the date the financial statements were available to be issued. In October 2023, the Company repaid the entire $100.0 outstanding balance on the Revolving Credit Facility using cash on hand. In January 2024, the Company paid a cash distribution of $37.7 to its partners pursuant to Section 4.6(d) of the Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement. ----- KPMG LLP Suite 500 191 West Nationwide Blvd. Columbus, OH 43215-2568 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Stockholders and Board of Directors Emerson Electric Co.: Opinion on the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated and combined balance sheets of Climate Technologies (a Business of Emerson Electric Co.) (the Company) as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated and combined statements of earnings, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2022, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated and combined financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated and combined financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Basis for Opinion These consolidated and combined financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated and combined financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB and in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated and combined financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated and combined financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated and combined financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated and combined financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated and combined financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated and combined financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated and combined financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. KPMG LLP, a Delaware limited liability partnership and a member firm of ----- Sufficiency of audit evidence over net sales As discussed in Notes 1, 2 and 15 to the Company’s consolidated and combined financial statements, and disclosed in the consolidated and combined statements of earnings, the Company recorded $5.1 billion of net sales in 2022. We identified the evaluation of the sufficiency of audit evidence over net sales as a critical audit matter. Net sales are recognized primarily from the sale of manufactured products at locations in multiple countries around the world. Evaluating the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained required subjective auditor judgment because of the geographical dispersion of the Company’s net sales generating activities. This included determining the locations at which procedures were performed and evaluating the evidence obtained over net sales. The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We applied auditor judgment to determine the nature and extent of procedures to be performed over net sales, including the determination of the Company locations at which those procedures were to be performed. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company’s net sales process. At each location where procedures were performed, we assessed the recorded net sales by selecting a sample of transactions and compared the amounts recognized for consistency with underlying documentation, including contracts with customers and other third-party evidence. We evaluated the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained by assessing the results of procedures performed, including the appropriateness of the nature and extent of such evidence. We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2022.

CT is a leading provider of compression products, electronics, software and solutions across many applications within Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning and Refrigeration (HVACR) and other heating applications, food service and retail, transportation, and healthcare/life sciences. CT’s compression technologies enable higher efficiency in commercial and residential HVAC units, as well as in commercial refrigeration units. CT also has a solution portfolio that manages, monitors and controls refrigeration units in the commercial setting, as well as software solutions that measure and monitor temperature conditions of refrigerated goods in transit. The Proposed Transaction On October 31, 2022, Emerson announced an agreement to sell a majority stake in Climate Technologies to private equity funds managed by Blackstone in a transaction valued at $14.0 billion. Emerson will receive upfront, pre-tax cash proceeds of approximately $9.5 billion and a note of $2.25 billion at close, while retaining a 45 percent non-controlling common equity ownership interest in a new standalone joint venture between Emerson and Blackstone. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of calendar year 2023, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation The Company has historically operated as part of Emerson and not as a stand-alone entity. These consolidated and combined financial statements present the historical financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of the Company as if it had operated on a standalone basis subject to Emerson’s control and include all accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates on a consolidated basis. Intercompany transactions, profits and balances among CT entities have been eliminated in consolidation. These financial statements were derived from Emerson’s financial statements and accounting records and have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). Sale and purchase transactions between the Company and other Emerson affiliates are included in the financial statements. See Note 12. As a business of Emerson, CT has been charged for costs directly related to the Company and has been allocated a portion of Emerson’s general corporate costs. All of these costs are reflected in these consolidated and combined financial statements. The Company participates in various Emerson programs which include information technology services, employee benefits, medical insurance, and other programs. Costs associated with these programs are charged to the Company based on Emerson’s actual cost and the Company’s relative level of usage. The Company also utilizes Emerson’s global shared service centers and is charged for direct costs and its share of facilities overhead. Emerson provides certain oversight and support services, including assistance with management strategy, logistics, marketing, finance, treasury, tax, human resources, legal and other activities. Emerson also charges royalties for use of Emerson’s trademarks and trade names and supply chain services. A charge for these services and royalties has been allocated to the Company based principally on revenue. While management believes the methodologies and assumptions used to allocate these costs are reasonable, the financial statements do not purport to represent the financial position, or the results of operations, changes in equity, and cash flows of the Company in the future, or what they would have been had the Company operated as a stand-alone entity during the periods presented. ----- Emerson utilizes a centralized treasury function which manages the working capital and financing needs of all of its business operations. This function oversees a cash pooling arrangement which sweeps participating CT cash accounts into pooled Emerson cash accounts on a daily basis. Pooled cash and nontrade intercompany balances attributable to Emerson have not been presented as assets and liabilities in the accompanying consolidated and combined financial statements. These balances are reflected as ""Net parent investment"" in the equity section of the consolidated and combined balance sheets. Changes in these balances are reflected as ""Net transfer to Emerson'' in the financing activities section of the consolidated and combined statements of cash flows. Cash and cash equivalents from CT entities not participating in the Emerson centralized treasury function and specifically attributable to the Company have been reflected in the consolidated and combined financial statements. Use of Estimates The preparation of the consolidated and combined financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses for the periods presented. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Foreign Currency The consolidated and combined financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, which is the Company’s reporting currency. The functional currency for the Company’s operations in Mexico, Argentina, Thailand, Hong Kong, Denmark and the majority in the Middle East is U.S. dollars while most other non-U.S. operations use the local currency. Adjustments resulting from translating local currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies are subject to changes in exchange rates with resulting gains/losses recorded in net earnings. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of highly-liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. Receivables and Allowance for Credit Losses Receivables are shown net of allowance for credit losses. The Company monitors customer-specific payment and write-off history as well as forward-looking trends and macro-economic factors to estimate an allowance for credit losses. Inventories Inventories are primarily stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value and are valued based on standard costs which approximate average costs. Cost standards are revised at the beginning of each fiscal year. The annual effect of resetting standards plus operating variances incurred during each period are allocated between inventories and recognized in cost of sales as products are sold. Following are the components of inventories as of September 30: 2021 2022 Raw materials $ 177.6 212.7 Work in process 26.7 25.7 Finished products 168.5 210.3 Total inventories $ 372.8 448.7 Property, Plant and Equipment The Company records investments in land, buildings, and machinery and equipment at cost. Depreciation is computed principally using the straight-line method over estimated service lives, which for principal assets are 30 to 40 years for buildings and 10 to 12 years for machinery and equipment. Long-lived tangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Impairment losses, if any, are recognized based on estimated fair values if the sum of expected future undiscounted cash flows of the related assets is less ----- than the carrying values. Following are the components of property, plant and equipment as of September 30: 2021 2022 Land $ 32.4 32.5 Buildings 578.5 572.6 Machinery and equipment 2,517.3 2,536.0 Construction in progress 116.7 196.6 Property, plant and equipment, at cost $ 3,244.9 3,337.7 Less: Accumulated depreciation (2,249.3) (2,306.0) Property, plant and equipment, net $ 995.6 1,031.7 Goodwill and Other Intangibles Assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method and recorded at their respective fair values. Goodwill represents the excess of consideration paid over total fair value of the net assets acquired. The Company conducts its annual impairment test of goodwill in the fourth quarter and between tests if events or circumstances indicate a reporting unit’s fair value may be less than its carrying value. If an initial assessment indicates it is more likely than not goodwill might be impaired, it is evaluated by comparing the reporting unit’s estimated fair value to its carrying value. An impairment charge would be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. Estimated fair values are developed primarily under an income approach that discounts estimated future cash flows using risk adjusted interest rates, as well as earnings multiples or other techniques as warranted. Fair values are subject to changes in underlying economic conditions. All of the Company’s identifiable intangible assets are subject to amortization on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Identifiable intangible assets consist of capitalized software, intellectual property and customer relationships and are also subject to evaluation for potential impairment if events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. No goodwill or intangible asset impairment was recorded for any of the periods presented. Leases The Company leases offices; manufacturing facilities and equipment; and transportation, information technology, and office equipment primarily under operating lease arrangements. The Company determines whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease at contract inception. An arrangement contains a lease if the Company has the right to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the economic benefits of an identified asset. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at lease commencement based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recognized on the balance sheet and are recorded as short-term lease expenses. The discount rate used to calculate present value is the Company’s incremental borrowing rate based on the lease term and the economic environment of the applicable country or region. Certain leases have renewal options or options to terminate prior to lease expiration, which are included in the measurement of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities when it is reasonably certain they will be exercised. The Company has elected to account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for its offices and manufacturing facilities. Some lease arrangements include payments that are adjusted periodically based on actual charges incurred for common area maintenance, utilities, taxes and insurance, or changes in an index or rate referenced in the lease. The fixed portion of these payments is included in the measurement of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities at lease commencement, while the variable portion is recorded as variable lease expense. The Company’s leases do not contain material residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants. Noncontrolling Interests in a Subsidiary The Company holds a 51% controlling financial interest in Alliance Compressors LLC (“Alliance”) and therefore, the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of Alliance have been included in the ----- Company’s consolidated and combined financial statements. The remaining 49% interest in Alliance are accounted for as noncontrolling interests in subsidiary in the Company’s consolidated and combined financial statements. The Alliance joint venture agreement includes contingent put options that could require the Company to purchase the noncontrolling interests in the event of a change in control of Emerson or Alliance. In the event that a change of control occurs, and the put options are exercised by holders of the 49% interests, the Company would be required to purchase the noncontrolling interests in Alliance for approximately $130. Net Parent Investment The net parent investment balance included in the consolidated and combined balance sheets represents Emerson’s historical investment in the Company, the Company’s accumulated net earnings after income taxes, and the net effect of transactions with Emerson. Revenue Recognition In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, the Company evaluates its contracts with customers to identify the promised goods or services and recognize revenue for the identified performance obligations at the amount the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to a customer. Revenue is recognized when, or as performance obligations are satisfied, and control has transferred to the customer, typically when products are shipped or delivered, title and risk of loss pass to the customer, and the Company has a present right to payment. The vast majority of the Company's revenues are performance obligations related to the sale of manufactured products which are recognized at a point in time when control transfers in accordance with shipping terms. In limited circumstances, contracts include multiple performance obligations, where revenue is recognized separately for each good or service, as well as contracts where revenue is recognized over time as control transfers to the customer. For revenues recognized over time, the Company typically uses an input method to determine progress and recognize revenue, based on costs incurred. The Company believes costs incurred closely correspond with its performance under the contract and the transfer of control to the customer. In sales arrangements that involve multiple performance obligations, revenue is allocated based on the relative standalone selling price for each performance obligation. Observable selling prices from actual transactions are used whenever possible. In other instances, the Company determines the standalone selling price based on third-party pricing or management's best estimate. Payment terms vary but are generally short-term in nature. The Company’s long-term contracts, where revenue is generally recognized over time, are billed as work progresses in accordance with the contract terms and conditions, either at periodic intervals or upon achievement of certain milestones. The timing of revenue recognition and billings under these contracts results in either unbilled receivables (contract assets) when revenue recognized exceeds billings, or customer advances (contract liabilities) when billings exceed revenue recognized. Unbilled receivables are reclassified to accounts receivable when an unconditional right to consideration exists, typically when a milestone in the contract is achieved. The Company does not evaluate whether the transaction price includes a significant financing component for contracts where the time between cash collection and performance is less than one year. Certain arrangements with customers include variable consideration, typically in the form of rebates, cash discounts or penalties. Other than standard product warranty provisions, sales arrangements provide no other post shipment obligations on the Company. In most instances, returns are limited to product quality issues. The Company records a reduction to revenue at the time of sale to reflect the ultimate amount of consideration it expects to receive. The Company’s estimates are updated quarterly based on historical experience, trend analysis, and expected market conditions. Variable consideration is typically not constrained at the time revenue is recognized. See Notes 2 and 15 for additional information about the Company’s revenues. ----- In the years presented, the Company had one significant customer who accounted for over 10 percent of net sales. This customer had approximately 12 to 13 percent of net sales in 2022, 2021, and 2020. The Company records amounts billed to customers for the costs of shipping and handling in sales transactions as revenue and such costs are not considered separate performance obligations. Shipping and handling costs incurred by the Company were $35.5, $50.6 and $39.8 for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and were reported in selling, general and administrative expenses. Warranty Warranties largely provide assurance that the product will function as intended and generally extend for a period of one to two years from the date of sale. Warranties vary by product line and are competitive for the markets in which the Company operates. Provisions for warranty expense are estimated at the time of sale based on historical experience and adjusted quarterly for any known issues that may arise. Warranty costs were, $29.7, $27.5 and $32.4, respectively, or approximately 0.6 percent, 0.6 percent and 0.9 percent of net sales in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Supplier Finance Program Emerson facilitates a voluntary supplier finance program (the ""Program"") to provide certain Company suppliers with the opportunity to sell receivables due from the Company to the participating financial institution in the Program. Such sales are conducted at the sole discretion of both the suppliers and the financial institution on a non-recourse basis at a rate that leverages Emerson’s credit rating and thus might be more beneficial to the supplier. The Company's responsibility is limited to making payment on the terms originally negotiated with its suppliers, regardless of whether the suppliers sell their receivables to the financial institution. Emerson and the Company do not enter into any agreements with suppliers regarding their participation in the Program. The amount owed to the participating financial institution under the Program and included in accounts payable was $170.8 at September 30, 2022 and $161.2 at September 30, 2021. Fair Value Measurement ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement, establishes a formal hierarchy and framework for measuring certain financial statement items at fair value, and requires disclosures about fair value measurements and the reliability of valuation inputs. Under ASC 820, measurement assumes the transaction to sell an asset or transfer a liability occurs in the principal or at least the most advantageous market for that asset or liability. Within the hierarchy, Level 1 instruments use observable market prices for the identical item in active markets and have the most reliable valuations. Level 2 instruments are valued through broker/dealer quotation or through market-observable inputs for similar items in active markets, including forward and spot prices, interest rates and volatilities. Level 3 instruments are valued using inputs not observable in an active market, such as company-developed future cash flows, and are considered the least reliable. Valuations for all the Company’s financial instruments fall within Level 2. See Note 7. Carrying value approximates fair value for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The Company’s foreign currency exposures relate to transactions denominated in currencies that differ from the functional currencies of its subsidiaries, principally Mexican pesos. Foreign exchange forwards are utilized, as needed, to hedge foreign currency exposures impacting sales or cost of sales transactions, firm commitments, or the fair value of assets and liabilities. Commodity exposures are price fluctuations on forecasted purchases of copper and aluminum. All derivatives are associated with specific underlying exposures and the Company does not hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. The initial duration of hedge positions is less than two years. All derivatives are accounted for under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and recognized at fair value. For derivatives hedging variability in future cash flows, any gain or loss is deferred in equity and recognized when the underlying hedged transaction impacts earnings. The Company’s foreign currency derivatives and most commodity derivatives qualify for hedge accounting. Gains or losses on derivative instruments ----- that do not receive hedge accounting treatment under ASC 815 are recognized in the income statement immediately. Income Taxes The Company’s operations have historically been included in Emerson’s combined U.S. and non-U.S. income tax returns in most locations. Income tax expense included in the financial statements has been calculated following the separate return method, which applies ASC 740, Income Taxes, as if the Company was a stand-alone enterprise and a separate taxpayer for the periods presented. The calculation of income taxes on a separate return basis requires considerable judgment and the use of both estimates and allocations that affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expenses. As a result, the Company’s deferred income tax rate and deferred tax balances may differ from those in Emerson’s historical results. The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of ASC 740. Under this approach, deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. Deferred taxes result from differences between the financial statement and tax basis of the Company’s assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted rates in effect for the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. The tax carryforwards reflected in the Company’s consolidated and combined financial statements have been determined using the separate return method. The complexity of tax regulations requires assessments of uncertainties in estimating taxes the Company will ultimately pay. The Company recognizes liabilities for anticipated tax audit uncertainties in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether, and the extent to which additional taxes would be due on a separate return basis. Tax liabilities are presented net of any related tax loss carryforwards. The Company also provides for income taxes, net of any potentially available foreign tax credits, on earnings intended to be repatriated from foreign subsidiaries. The undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of September 30, 2022 are considered permanently invested or otherwise indefinitely retained for continuing international operations. Recognition of income taxes on undistributed foreign earnings, if any, would be triggered by a decision to repatriate earnings. Determination of the amount of taxes that might be paid on any undistributed earnings if eventually remitted is not practicable. Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Effective October 1, 2021, the Company adopted three accounting standard updates which had an immaterial or no impact on the Company’s financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2022. These included:  Updates to ASC 805, Business Combinations, which clarify the accounting for contract assets and liabilities assumed in a business combination. In general, this will result in contract liabilities being recognized at their historical amounts under ASC 606, rather than at fair value in accordance with the general requirements of ASC 805.  Updates to ASC 740, Income Taxes, which require the recognition of a franchise tax that is partially based on income as an income-based tax with any incremental amount as a non-income based tax. These updates also make certain changes to intra-period tax allocation principles and interim tax calculations.  Updates to ASC 321, Equity Securities, ASC 323 Investments- Equity Method and Joint Ventures, and ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging, which clarify how to account for the transition into and out of the equity method of accounting when evaluating observable transactions. ----- In fiscal 2021, the Company adopted two accounting standard updates and one new accounting standard and in fiscal 2020 adopted updates to ASC 815, all of which had an immaterial or no impact on the Company’s financial statements. These included:  Updates to ASC 350, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other, which eliminate the requirement to measure impairment based on the implied fair value of goodwill compared to the carrying amount of a reporting unit’s goodwill. Instead, goodwill impairment will be measured as the excess of a reporting unit carrying amount over its estimated fair value.  Updates to ASC 350, Intangibles- Goodwill and Other, which align the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a software hosting arrangement with the requirements for costs incurred to developer obtain internal-use software.  Adoption of ASC 326, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses, which amends the impairment model by requiring entities to use a forward-looking approach to estimate lifetime expected credit losses on certain types of financial instruments, including trade receivables.  Updates to ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, which permit hedging certain contractually specified risk components. The updates eliminate the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness and simplify hedge documentation and effectiveness assessment requirements. #### (2) REVENUE RECOGNITION The following table summarizes the balances of the Company's unbilled receivables (contract assets), which are reported in Other current assets, and its customer advances (contract liabilities), which are reported in Accrued expenses and Other long-term liabilities. 2021 2022 Unbilled receivables (contract assets) $       3.1 8.9 Customer advances (contract liabilities) (23.0) (102.6) Net contract liabilities $     (19.9) (93.7) The majority of the Company's contract balances relate to arrangements where revenue is recognized over time and payments from customers are made according to a contractual billing schedule. The increase in net contract liabilities was due to customer advances which exceeded revenue recognized for performance completed during the period. Revenue recognized for 2022 included approximately $18.5 that was included in the beginning contract liability balance. Revenue recognized for 2022 for performance obligations that were satisfied in previous periods, including cumulative catchup adjustments on the Company's long-term contracts, was not material. Capitalized amounts related to incremental costs to obtain customer contracts and costs to fulfill contracts are immaterial. As of September 30, 2022, the Company's backlog relating to unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) performance obligations in contracts with its customers was approximately $1.0 billion. The Company expects to recognize approximately 93 percent of its remaining performance obligations as revenue over the next 12 months, with the remainder substantially over the subsequent two years thereafter. #### (3) ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES In January 2021, the Company sold its 40% interest in Ruking for $68.0 and in September 2021, sold certain product lines for $4.1. Pretax gains of $30.1 and $2.9, respectively, were recognized related to these divestitures. ----- In November 2020, the Company acquired the remaining 60% equity interest it did not already own of 7AC Technologies Inc. (7AC), a company specializing in liquid desiccant-based technology for HVAC applications, for approximately $19.0, net of cash acquired. This acquisition is reported in the HVACR Tech segment. The total fair value of 7AC was approximately $48.0 at the date of acquisition, including $15.1 and $23.0 allocated to In-process research and development (IPR&D) and goodwill, respectively. CT recognized a gain of $16.7 related to the excess of the fair value of its previously held equity investment over its carrying value. In March 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of Verdant, a leader in energy management solutions for the hotel and hospitality industries, for approximately $97.3, net of cash acquired. This business, which had annual sales of approximately $25.0 at the time of acquisition and is reported in the Comfort Control segment, broadens CT’s growing energy management and optimization capabilities for residential and commercial applications. The Company recognized goodwill of $58.9 (none of which is expected to be tax deductible), identifiable intangible assets of $38.7, primarily intellectual property and customer relationships with a weighted-average useful life of approximately 7 years, and deferred tax liabilities of $9.2. Results of operations for the year ended September 30, 2020 included first year pretax acquisition accounting charges related to inventory and deferred revenue of $1.2 and $0.3, respectively. #### (4) OTHER DEDUCTIONS (INCOME), NET Other deductions (income), net, are summarized as follows: 2020 2021 2022 Environmental expenses $ 1.0 0.8 1.2 Restructuring expense (see Note 5) 16.7 12.3 10.5 Amortization of intangibles 22.1 23.0 21.1 Gain on acquisitions and divestitures (see Note 3) - (49.7) Interest income, net (1.8) (1.6) (1.5) Foreign currency loss (gain), net 4.7 1.5 (7.6) Other, net 5.3 1.1 1.6 Total $ 48.0 (12.6) 25.3 Other, net is composed of several items that are individually immaterial including, bad debt expense, losses on disposals of property, plant and equipment and other items. #### (5) RESTRUCTURING COSTS Restructuring activity reflects costs associated with the Company's efforts to continually improve operational efficiency and deploy assets to remain competitive. Restructuring expenses were $10.5, $12.3 and $16.7, for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Restructuring expense by business segment follows: 2020 2021 2022 HVACR Tech $ 9.9 6.8 7.0 Comfort Control 1.3 1.3 1.4 Cold Chain 5.3 3.4 0.7 Corporate and other 0.2 0.8 1.4 Total $ 16.7 12.3 10.5 ----- The change in the liability for the restructuring of operations during the years ended September 30 follows: Paid/ Paid/ 2020 Expense 2021 Expense 2022 Utilized Utilized Severance and $ 10.6 11.2 (4.6) 17.2 3.5 (5.5) 15.2 benefits Other - 1.1 (0.5) 0.6 7.0 (7.1) 0.5 Total $ 10.6 12.3 (5.1) 17.8 10.5 (12.6) 15.7 Costs incurred in 2022 included startup costs from moving certain production from the US to Mexico, shutdown costs related to contractual termination in Asia and severance and benefit costs related to a reduction in force in Europe and an early retirement program in the US. Actions in 2022 resulted in total workforce reductions of 61 positions. Costs incurred in 2021 included severance and benefits related to moving certain production from the US to Mexico, the reduction of 100 positions related to the transfer of responsibilities to Emerson sharedservice centers and workforce reductions in the US. Actions in 2021 resulted in total workforce reductions of approximately 400 positions. Costs incurred in 2020 included severance and benefits related to reductions in force in the US, Mexico, Europe, and Asia to improve operating margins. These actions resulted in the elimination of approximately 300 positions. Shutdown costs were also incurred from contract termination related to a facility in Europe. (6) GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES The change in the carrying value of goodwill follows: HVACR Tech Comfort Control Cold Chain Total Balance, September 30, 2019 $ 352.5 12.0 276.9 641.4 Acquisitions  - 58.9  - 58.9 Foreign currency translation (0.1) (0.1) 3.1 2.9 and other Balance, September 30, 2020 $ 352.4 70.8 280.0 703.2 Acquisitions and divestitures 23.0 (0.6)  - 22.4 Foreign currency translation 0.1                          - (0.3) (0.2) and other Balance, September 30, 2021 $ 375.5 70.2 279.7 725.4 Foreign currency translation (3.2)                           - (6.3) (9.5) and other Balance, September 30, 2022 $ 372.3 70.2 273.4 715.9 ----- The gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization of identifiable intangible assets by major class follow: Customer Intellectual Capitalized Total Relationships Property Software 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 Gross carrying $ 172.5 169.4 160.3 160.6 141.5 140.7 474.3 470.7 amount Less: Accumulated (91.2) (98.8) (87.2) (95.8) (117.3) (124.5) (295.7) (319.1) amortization Net carrying $ 81.3 70.6 73.1 64.8 24.2 16.2 178.6 151.6 amount Total intangible asset amortization expense for 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $31.2, $35.3, and $35.2, respectively. Based on intangible asset balances as of September 30, 2022, expected amortization expense is $28.7 in 2023, $25.2 in 2024, $22.0 in 2025, $20.0 in 2026, and $15.3 in 2027. #### (7) FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Hedging Activities The Company is exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Foreign currency forward contracts are utilized to hedge anticipated costs of sales primarily denominated in Mexican Peso. As of September 30, 2022, the notional amount of foreign currency hedge positions was $342.0. The Company also hedges its exposure to commodity price fluctuations of copper and aluminum. Commodity derivatives totaled approximately $106.7 (31.3 million pounds) for copper and $5.4 (5.5 million pounds) for aluminum. All foreign currency forward contracts and the majority of commodity derivatives are cash flow hedges and receive hedge accounting treatment. A small percentage of the aluminum commodity derivatives do not receive hedge accounting treatment and are marked to market through other income (deductions). The majority of the unrealized gains and losses deferred in OCI as of September 30, 2022 are expected to be recognized over the next twelve months as the underlying transactions occur. The following gains and losses are included in earnings and other comprehensive income (OCI): Gain (Loss) Gain (Loss) to Earnings to OCI Location 2020 2021 2022 2020 2021 2022 Commodity Cost of sales $ (7.5) 32.3 11.7 9.9 29.3 (20.1) (0.1) 0.5 (0.3) Commodity Other (deductions) income, net Foreign 1.0 3.8 17.4 (10.5) 16.5 28.6 Cost of Sales currency Total $ (6.6) 36.6 28.8 (0.6) 45.8 8.5 Regardless of whether derivatives receive hedge accounting, the Company expects hedging gains or losses to be offset by losses or gains on the related underlying exposures. The amounts ultimately recognized will differ from those presented above for open positions, which remain subject to ongoing market price fluctuations until settlement. Derivatives receiving hedge accounting are highly effective and no amounts were excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. ----- Fair Value Measurement Valuations for all derivatives fall within Level 2 of the GAAP valuation hierarchy. The fair value of foreign currency and copper and aluminum contracts were reported in other current assets and accrued expenses as summarized below: 2021 2022 Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities Foreign Currency $ 8.4 1.7 19.0 1.1 Commodity $ 12.3 5.0 0.1 25.0 #### (8) LEASES The vast majority of Company leases relate to offices and manufacturing facilities. The table below presents information regarding lease assets and liabilities for the years ended September 30 follow: 2021 2022 Assets Operating lease right-of-use assets (Other assets) $ 63.4 49.5 Liabilities Operating leases (Accrued expenses) $ 16.9 15.8 Operating leases (Other liabilities) $ 47.9 35.3 The components of lease expense for the years ended September 30 follows: 2020 2021 2022 Operating lease expense $ 20.6 20.7 20.1 Variable lease expense 0.8 0.7 1.8 Short-term lease expense 2.3 1.6 1.4 Total $ 23.7 23.0 23.3 Sublease income was immaterial for the years ended September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021. Cash paid for operating leases are classified within operating cash flows and was $19.9 and $20.3 for the years ended September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, respectively. The weighted-average remaining lease term for operating leases was 4.5 years, and 4.9 years and the weighted-average discount rate was 3.6 percent and 2.8 percent as of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, respectively. ----- Future maturities of lease liabilities as of September 30, 2022 are summarized below: Operating Leases 2023 $ 17.2 2024 12.8 2025 8.2 2026 6.5 2027 5.5 Thereafter 5.6 Total lease payments $ 55.8 Less: Interest (4.7) Total lease liabilities $ 51.1 Lease commitments that have not yet commenced were immaterial as of September 30, 2022. #### (9) RETIREMENT PLANS Most of the Company’s employees participate in defined contribution plans, including 401(k), profit sharing, and other savings plans that provide retirement benefits. Total expenses related to employees participating in these plans were $20.7, $17.6, and $16.3 for 2022, 2021, and 2020 respectively. In addition, certain employees in the U.S., U.K., and other countries participate in Emerson defined benefit plans. The Company accounts for the cost of these plans as if it were a participant in a multiemployer plan. Costs charged to the Company related to Emerson defined benefit plans were based on specific actuarially determined service costs of Company employees. Total charges related to employees participating in these plans were $13.4, 13.0, and 13.8 for 2022, 2021, and 2020 respectively. Certain U.S. and non-U.S. employees participate in Company specific or statutorily required defined benefit plans. In general, the Company’s policy is to fund these plans based on legal requirements, required benefit payments, and other factors. Below are the disclosures related to these defined benefit plans. Defined benefit plans expense includes the following components: U.S. Plans Non-U.S. Plans 2020 2021 2022 2020 2021 2022 Company defined benefit plans: Service cost (benefits earned during the period) $ 1.6 1.6 1.6 3.1 3.1 2.6 Interest cost 2.2 1.9 2.0 1.5 1.8 1.8 Expected return (4.6) (4.7) (4.9) (0.7) (0.7) (0.7) on plan assets Net amortization 1.8 1.8 0.9 1.6 1.2 1.1 and other Net periodic pension expense (income) $ 1.0 0.6 (0.4) 5.5 5.4 4.8 ----- Details of the changes in the actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets for defined benefit pension plans follow: U.S. Plans Non-U.S. Plans 2021 2022 2021 2022 Projected benefit obligation, 79.7 79.0 79.0 80.9 beginning Service cost $ 1.6 1.6 3.1 2.6 Interest cost 1.9 2.0 1.8 1.8 Actuarial loss (gain) (2.6) (24.3) 0.7 (13.9) Benefits paid (3.0) (3.0) (1.6) (1.5) Plan amendments 1.4  -  -  Settlements  -  - (1.8) (1.3) Foreign currency translation -                                      - (0.3) (9.0) and other Projected benefit obligation, 79.0 55.3 80.9 59.6 ending Fair value of plan assets, $ 76.6 88.7 18.8 19.8 beginning Actual return on plan assets 13.8 (17.9) 0.8 0.8 Employer contributions 1.3 0.6 3.6 2.7 Benefits paid (3.0) (3.0) (1.6) (1.5) Settlements  -  - (1.8) (1.3) Foreign currency translation -                                      -                                      - (2.8) and other Fair value of plan assets, ending 88.7 68.4 19.8 17.7 Net amount recognized in the 9.7 13.1 (61.1) (41.9) balance sheet Location of net amount recognized in the balance sheet: Noncurrent asset 12.7 13.1 - 0.4 Current liability - - (2.7) (2.6) Noncurrent liability (3.0) - (58.4) (39.7) Net amount recognized in the 9.7 13.1 (61.1) (41.9) balance sheet Pretax accumulated other (0.8) (3.1) 21.5 5.0 comprehensive loss (income) Actuarial gains in 2022 were largely due to increase in the discount rates used to estimate the benefit obligations for the U.S. and non-US plans, which were 5.65% and 4.82% at September 30, 2022 compared to 3.03% and 2.26% at September 30, 2021, respectively. Actuarial gains in 2021 were largely due to an increase in the discount rate used to estimate the benefit obligations for the U.S. plan, which was 3.03% at September 30, 2021, compared to 2.94% at September 30, 2020. As of September 30, 2022, U.S. plans were overfunded by $13.1 and non-U.S. plans were underfunded by $41.9. The non-U.S. funded status includes unfunded plans totaling $41.9. ----- As of the September 30, 2022 and 2021 measurement dates, the plans' total accumulated benefit obligation was $105.1 and $145.7, respectively. The total projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for individual plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $44.7, $36.2 and $2.4, respectively, for 2022, and $103.4, $89.2 and $39.2, respectively, for 2021. The total projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for individual plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $42.3, $34.8 and $0.2, respectively, for 2022, and $100.9, $87.8 and $36.8, respectively, for 2021. Future benefit payments by U.S. plans are estimated to be $3.4 in 2023, $3.6 in 2024, $3.7 in 2025, $3.7 in 2026, $3.8 in 2027 and $19.6 in total over the five years 2028 through 2032. Based on foreign currency exchange rates as of September 30, 2022, future benefit payments by non-U.S. plans are estimated to be $3.3 in 2023, $3.3 in 2024, $3.3 in 2025, $3.4 in 2026, $4.0 in 2027 and $26.8 in total over the five years 2028 through 2032. The Company expects to contribute approximately $1.0 to its retirement plans in 2023. Company defined benefit pension plan expense for 2023 is expected to be approximately $1.9, versus $4.4 in 2022. The weighted-average assumptions used in the valuation of pension benefits are as follows: U.S. Plans Non-U.S. Plans 2020 2021 2022 2020 2021 2022 Net pension expense: Discount rate used to determine service cost Discount rate used to determine interest cost 3.53% 3.39% 3.31% 1.88% 2.13% 2.26% 2.96% 2.33% 2.52% 1.88% 2.13% 2.26% Expected return 6.80% 6.55% 6.18% 3.99% 3.87% 3.96% on plan assets Rate of compensation increase 3.50% 3.50% 3.50% 3.87% 3.86% 3.87% Benefit obligations: Discount rate 2.94% 3.03% 5.65% 2.13% 2.26% 4.82% Rate of compensation 3.50% 3.50% 4.54% 3.86% 3.87% 4.15% increase The discount rate for the U.S. retirement plans was 5.65 percent as of September 30, 2022. An actuarially developed, company-specific yield curve is used to determine the discount rate. To determine the service and interest cost components of pension expense for its U.S. retirement plans, the Company applies the specific spot rates along the yield curve, rather than the single weighted-average rate, to the projected cash flows to provide more precise measurement of these costs. The expected return on plan assets assumption is determined by reviewing the investment returns of the plans for the past 10 years plus longer-term historical returns of an asset mix approximating the Company's asset allocation targets, and periodically comparing these returns to expectations of investment advisors and actuaries to determine whether longterm future returns are expected to differ significantly from the past. ----- The Company's asset allocations at September 30, 2022 and 2021, and weighted-average target allocations follow: U.S. Plans Non-U.S. Plans 2021 2022 Target 2021 2022 Target Equity securities 46% 46% 45-50% 0% 0% 0% Debt securities 49% 49% 45-50% 1% 1% 1% Other 5% 5% 0-10% 99% 99% 99% Total 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% The primary objective for the investment of pension assets is to secure participant retirement benefits by earning a reasonable rate of return. Plan assets are invested consistent with the provisions of the prudence and diversification rules of ERISA and with a long-term investment horizon. The Company continuously monitors the value of assets by class and routinely rebalances to remain within target allocations. The equity strategy is to minimize concentrations of risk by investing primarily in a mix of companies that are diversified across geographies, market capitalization, style, sectors and industries worldwide. The approach for bonds emphasizes investment-grade corporate and government debt with maturities matching a portion of the longer duration pension liabilities. The bonds strategy also includes a high-yield element which is generally shorter in duration. For diversification, a small portion of U.S. plan assets is allocated to private equity partnerships and real asset fund investments, providing opportunities for above market returns. Leveraging techniques are not used and the use of derivatives in any fund is limited and inconsequential. The fair values of defined benefit plan assets as of September 30, organized by asset class and by the fair value hierarchy of ASC 820 as outlined in Note 1, follow. Investments valued based on the net asset value (NAV) of fund units held, as derived from the fair value of the underlying assets, are excluded from the fair value hierarchy. Measured Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Percentage at NAV 2022 U.S. equities $ 5.9 - - 20.2 26.1 30% International equities 3.2 - - 0.6 3.8 4% Emerging market -                             -                             - 1.8 1.8 2% equities Corporate bonds - 16.3 - 3.5 19.8 23% Government bonds - 6.7 - 6.7 13.4 16% Other - - 17.6 3.6 21.2 25% Total $ 9.1 23.0 17.6 36.4 86.1 100% 2021 U.S. equities $ 8.4 - - 22.8 31.2 29% International equities 5.2 0.1 - 1.3 6.6 6% Emerging market -                              -                              - 3.1 3.1 3% equities Corporate bonds - 21.3 - 5.3 26.6 24% Government bonds - 9.4 - 7.6 17.0 16% Other 0.6 - 19.7 3.7 24.0 22% Total $ 14.2 30.8 19.7 43.8 108.5 100% |Equity securities 46% 46%|45-50%|0% 0%|0%| |---|---|---|---| ----- Asset Classes U.S. equities reflect companies domiciled in the U.S., including multinational companies. International equities are comprised of companies domiciled in developed nations outside the U.S. Emerging market equities are comprised of companies domiciled in portions of Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America. Corporate bonds represent investment-grade debt of issuers primarily from the U.S. Government bonds include investment-grade instruments issued by federal, state and local governments, primarily in the U.S. Other includes cash, interests in mixed asset funds investing in commodities, natural resources, agriculture, real estate and infrastructure funds, life insurance contracts (U.S.), and shares in certain general investment funds of financial institutions or insurance arrangements (non-U.S.) that typically ensure no market losses or provide for a small minimum return guarantee. Fair Value Hierarchy Categories Valuations of Level 1 assets for all classes are based on quoted closing market prices from the principal exchanges where the individual securities are traded. Cash is valued at cost, which approximates fair value. Debt securities categorized as Level 2 assets are generally valued based on independent broker/dealer bids or by comparison to other debt securities having similar durations, yields and credit ratings. Valuation techniques and inputs for these assets include discounted cash flow analysis, earnings multiple approaches, recent transactions, transfer restrictions, prevailing discount rates, volatilities, credit ratings and other factors. In the Other class, interests in mixed asset funds are Level 2, and U.S. life insurance contracts and non-U.S. general fund investments and insurance arrangements are Level 3. Investments measured at NAV are primarily nonexchange-traded commingled or collective funds where the underlying securities have observable prices available from active markets and typically provide liquidity daily or within a few days. The NAV category also includes fund investments in private equities, real estate and infrastructure where the fair value of the underlying assets is determined by the investment manager. Total unfunded commitments for the private equity funds were approximately $6.0 at September 30, 2022. These investments cannot be redeemed, but instead the funds will make distributions through liquidation of the underlying assets, which is expected to occur over approximately the next 10 years. The real estate and infrastructure funds typically offer quarterly redemption. Details of the changes in value for Level 3 assets are as follows: 2021 2022 Level 3, beginning $ 18.7 19.7 Gains on assets held 0.8 0.8 Purchases, sales and settlements, net 0.2 (2.9) Level 3, ending $ 19.7 17.6 #### (10) INCOME TAXES The Company’s operations have historically been included in Emerson’s combined U.S. and non-U.S. income tax returns, in most locations. Income tax expense and deferred income tax balances are presented in the consolidated and combined financial statements as if the Company filed its own income tax returns in each jurisdiction. Accordingly, tax results are presented utilizing the separate return method, are not necessarily indicative of future performance and do not necessarily reflect the results that the Company would have generated as a separate and independent company for the periods presented. Earnings before income taxes consist of the following: 2020 2021 2022 United States $ 515.4 566.6 649.1 Non-U.S. 215.3 300.0 284.8 Total earnings before income taxes $ 730.7 866.6 933.9 ----- The principal components of income tax expense follow: 2020 2021 2022 Current: Federal 91.8 102.7 119.4 State and local 11.5 11.8 13.5 Non-U.S. 58.3 69.6 61.6 Deferred: Federal 5.2 (2.7) (1.6) State and local 0.3 (0.5) 0.6 Non-U.S. (7.0) (3.8) (0.1) Income tax expense $ 160.1 177.1 193.4 Reconciliation of U.S. federal statutory taxes to the Company’s total income tax expense follows: 2020 2021 2022 Taxes at U.S. statutory rate (21%) 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0% State and local taxes, net of federal tax benefit 1.3 1.0 1.2 Non-U.S. rate differential 2.5 1.1 2.3 FDII (0.9) (0.9) (1.0) Tax Holidays (1.0) (0.3) (1.0) Other (1.0) (1.5) (1.8) Total effective income tax rate 21.9 % 20.4% 20.7% Non-U.S. tax holidays reduce tax rates in certain jurisdictions and are expected to expire over the three years. Following are changes in unrecognized tax benefits before considering recoverability of cross-jurisdictional tax credits (federal, state, and non-U.S.) and temporary differences. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits is not expected to significantly increase within the next 12 months. 2021 2022 Beginning balance $ 11.5 13.4 Additions for current year tax positions 1.9 2.0 Additions for prior year tax positions 2.6 0.0 Reductions for prior year tax positions (0.7) (0.8) Reductions for expirations of statute of limitations (1.9) (1.1) Ending balance $ 13.4 13.5 The Company accrues interest and penalties related to income taxes in income tax expense. Total interest and penalties recognized were $0.3, $1.5, and $1.0 in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, total accrued interest and penalties were $3.1 and $2.8, respectively. The U.S. is the major jurisdiction for which the Company files income tax returns. Examinations for the U.S. are complete through 2013. The status of state and other non-U.S. tax examinations varies due to the numerous legal entities and jurisdictions in which the Company operates. ----- The principal items that gave rise to deferred income tax assets and liabilities follow: 2021 2022 Deferred tax assets: Net operating losses and tax credits $ 10.8 7.3 Accrued liabilities 31.6 28.2 Employee compensation and benefits 29.8 22.9 Other 8.4 9.8 Total $ 80.6 68.2 Valuation allowances (3.0) (3.4) Deferred tax liabilities: Intangibles (38.2) (32.3) Property, plant and equipment (54.0) (50.9) Other (3.4) Total $ (95.6) (83.2) Net deferred income tax liability $ (18.0) (18.4) Total income taxes paid were approximately $192, $169, $130, in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Most of the $7.3 net operating losses and tax credits can be carried forward indefinitely while the remainder expire over varying periods. #### (11) STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION Certain employees of the Company participate in Emerson stock-based compensation plans, which include performance shares and restricted stock units. Compensation expense is recognized based on Emerson’s cost of the awards determined under ASC 718, Compensation – Stock Compensation. Stock-based compensation expenses reflected in the consolidated and combined financial statements related to Company employees were $15.6, $22.4 and $13.3 for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. #### (12) RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS As a business of Emerson, the Company has been charged for costs directly attributable to CT and allocated a portion of Emerson’s general corporate costs. All these costs are reflected in the Company’s financial statements. Management believes the methodologies and assumptions used to allocate costs to the Company are reasonable. Emerson maintains a centralized information technology function that supports its business units. Services provided include application hosting, network support, network security, messaging and technology related services. Charges to the Company for these services are based on Emerson’s cost and the Company’s actual usage. Emerson administers a medical insurance program for its U.S. employees in which the Company participates and for which it records the cost of claims incurred each period. The Company participates in other Emerson programs including, but not limited to, workers’ compensation and general and product liability insurance. Other Emerson programs are charged to the Company based on costs incurred and usage. The Company utilizes Emerson global shared service centers that host Companydedicated resources providing customer facing support, engineering and back office financial services. Costs for these resources are charged directly to the Company, with the majority relating to employee compensation and benefits and the remaining portion relating to facility overhead. In addition, general corporate costs incurred by Emerson and trademark and tradename royalties and supply chain services are allocated to the Company primarily based on its proportionate share of Emerson’s total consolidated revenue, and include the cost of support functions such as procurement, logistics, marketing, human resources, legal, finance, internal audit and other Emerson corporate functions. ----- Costs incurred for Emerson-managed functions for the years ended September 30: 2020 2021 2022 Information technology $ 25.9 25.5 30.3 Insurance / other services $ 28.4 62.5 34.9 Shared services $ 30.5 32.5 35.2 Corporate costs $ 57.5 69.1 75.0 Royalties and other services $ 21.8 27.4 33.6 The Company had sales to Emerson affiliates of $84.0, $59.8 and $55.7 in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Company had purchases from Emerson affiliates of $1.9, $3.2 and $1.6 in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Related-party amounts reported in the balance sheet as of September 30: 2021 2022 Accounts receivable $ 62.5 29.9 Accounts payable $ 25.1 13.8 #### (13) CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS The Company is a party to a number of pending legal proceedings and claims, including those involving general and product liability (including asbestos), and other matters. The Company accrues for such liabilities when it is probable that future costs (including legal fees and expenses) will be incurred and such costs can be reasonably estimated. Accruals are based on developments to date; management's estimates of the outcomes of these matters; the Company's experience in contesting, litigating and settling similar matters; and any related insurance coverage. While the Company believes a material adverse impact is unlikely, it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of these matters. Given the inherent uncertainty of litigation, a remote possibility exists that a future development could have a material adverse impact on the Company. The Company engages an outside expert to develop an actuarial estimate of its expected costs to resolve all pending and future asbestos claims, including defense costs, as well as its related insurance receivable. The reserve for asbestos litigation, which is recorded on an undiscounted basis, was $17.8 and $27.8 and the insurance receivable was $16.6 and $22.7 as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company is also responsible for environmental remediation at various facilities presently or formerly operated by the Company. The environmental remediation liability is recorded based upon the best estimate of costs to be incurred in light of the progress made in determining the magnitude of remediation costs, the timing, and extent of remedial actions required by governmental authorities. As of September 30, 2022, the Company estimated total liability for environmental remediation costs ranges from a minimum of $6.8 to a maximum of $17.1. The actual costs the Company will incur are dependent on final determination of contamination and required remedial action, negotiations with governmental authorities with respect to cleanup levels, changes in regulatory requirements, innovations in investigatory and remedial technologies, effectiveness of remedial technologies employed, the ability of other responsible parties to pay, and any insurance or other third-party recoveries. As of September 30, 2022, the Company estimated a total liability of $14.3 for environmental remediationand related legal costs regarding these facilities. Approximately $3.0 and $11.3 is recorded in accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities, respectively. As of September 30, 2021, approximately $2.8 and $11.4 is recorded in accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities, respectively. As of September 30, 2022, there were no other known contingent liabilities (including guarantees, taxes and other claims) that management believes will be material in relation to the Company’s financial statements, nor were there any material commitments outside the normal course of business. ----- #### (14) ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME 2020 2021 2022 Foreign currency translation, beginning $ (0.2) 11.7 22.5 Other comprehensive income (loss) 11.9 10.8 (42.3) Foreign currency translation, ending $ 11.7 22.5 (19.8) Pension, beginning $ (26.6) (23.0) (13.7) Amortization of deferred losses into earnings, net of income taxes of: 2020 $(0.9); 2021 $(0.6); 2022 2.0 2.2 1.3 $(0.6) Actuarial gains deferred during the period, net of income taxes of: 2020 $(0.8); 2021 $(1.8); 2022 $(4.5) 1.6 7.1 10.3 Pension, ending $ (23.0) (13.7) (2.1) Cash flow hedges, beginning $ (1.4) 3.5 10.6 Gains (losses) deferred during the period, net of income taxes of: 2020 $0.1; 2021, $(10.0); 2022, (0.5) 35.8 6.3 $(2.2) Reclassification of (gains) losses to cost of sales, net of income taxes of: 2020 $(1.1); 2021 $7.4; 2022, $6.0 5.4 (28.7) (23.1) Cash flow hedges, ending $ 3.5 10.6 (6.2) Accumulated other comprehensive income $ (7.8) 19.4 (28.1) #### (15) BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION Climate Technologies is a leading provider of products and solutions for many areas of the climate control industry, including residential heating and cooling, commercial air conditioning, commercial and industrial refrigeration, and cold chain management.

(“Emerald,” “JV NewCo,” or the “Company”) is a leading provider of compression technologies, electronics and controls products, as well as components, software and solutions that broadly serve applications across the Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning and Refrigeration (“HVACR”) and Industrial industries. The Company’s businesses are primarily organized by product offering. The Company’s products are organized into two broad categories - HVACR Technologies and Electronics and Controls. Geographically, we organize through three world areas - Americas, Asia, Middle East and Africa (“AMEA”) and Europe. The served applications include, among others, heating and cooling including heat pump applications, food service / retail / industrial refrigeration, perishable goods, transportation, healthcare / life sciences, and renewable energy. The Company’s compression technologies enable higher efficiency in commercial and residential HVAC units, as well as in commercial and industrial refrigeration units. The Company also has a solution portfolio that manages, monitors and controls refrigeration units in the commercial setting, as well as software solutions that measure and monitor temperature conditions of refrigerated goods in transit. The Company’s industrial products are designed into renewable energy processes including RNG and Biogas applications. In general, the company’s technologies and solutions address global trends, including (i) the decarbonization and increased energy efficiency of heating, cooling, refrigeration, and industrial processes, (ii) the drive towards lower-GWP refrigerants, and (iii) the efficient transport of perishable goods including food and medicine. The Company now operates under the Copeland brand, as well as the Sensi, Verdant, Vilter and White-Rodgers sub-brands. Emerald JV Holdings L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, was formed by Emerson Electric Co. (“Emerson”), to hold its Climate Technologies Business (“Climate Technologies”) in connection with the acquisition of a majority stake in Climate Technologies (the “Acquisition”) by certain investment funds affiliated with Blackstone Inc. (“Blackstone”). The Company currently holds Climate Technologies, after the completion of certain restructuring steps undertaken by Emerson to transfer Climate Technologies to JV NewCo (the “Restructuring”). As Emerald JV Holdings L.P. did not have any previous operations, Climate Technologies is viewed as the predecessor to the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries.

Periods subsequent to May 31, 2023 reflect the financial statements of the Company after the Acquisition (referred to herein as the “Successor” period). The Company’s assets and liabilities were adjusted to fair value on the closing date of the Acquisition. Due to the change in the basis of accounting, the consolidated and combined financial statements for the Predecessor and the consolidated financial statements for the Successor are not comparable. Where applicable, a “black line” separates the Successor and Predecessor periods to highlight the lack of comparability. The Successor Statement of Operations reflects the results of the business following the closing of the Acquisition. However, on May 19, 2023, Emerald Debt Merger Sub L.L.C (“Merger Sub”), a subsidiary of Emerald JV Holdings, L.P., and which was merged with and into EMRLD Borrower LP (“EMRLD Borrower”) on the Acquisition Date (as defined below), and Emerald Co-Issuer Inc., a direct subsidiary of Merger Sub (“Co-Issuer,” together with EMRLD Borrower, the “Issuers”), issued senior secured notes in the aggregate principal amount of $2,275.0 and aggregate principal amount of €455.0 (or $500.0 U.S. dollar equivalent, based on the exchange rate of approximately $1.10 per €1.00), the “Original Dollar Notes” and “Original Euro Notes”, respectively and collectively the “Original Notes”. ----- This report includes historical consolidated financial statements and certain financial data of the Company in lieu of consolidated financial statements and financial data for EMRLD Borrower, the borrower under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities (defined below) and an issuer of the Notes and the direct subsidiary of EMRLD Guarantor LP (“Holdings”). The Company does not have any material operating, investing, or financing activities other than being (i) the issuer of the Preferred Equity and (ii) a holding company for EMRLD Seller Notes Issuer LP (the “Emerson Notes Issuer”) and Holdings and its subsidiaries. Accordingly, with the exception of the Preferred Equity issued by the Company (see Note 15 for further details), and the Emerson Notes (defined below) issued by the Emerson Notes Issuer (see Note 12 for further details), the consolidated Balance Sheet and results of operations of Holdings and its subsidiaries, including EMRLD Borrower, would be substantially identical to those of the Company and its subsidiaries for the periods for which financial information is presented in this report. Prior to the consummation of the Acquisition, Climate Technologies had historically operated as part of Emerson and not as a standalone entity. The consolidated and combined financial statements for the Predecessor period present the historical financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of the Company as if it had operated on a standalone basis subject to Emerson’s control and include all accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates on a consolidated basis. Intercompany transactions, profits and balances among Climate Technologies entities have been eliminated in consolidation. The Predecessor period consolidated and combined financial statements were derived from Emerson’s financial statements and accounting records and have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). Sale and purchase transactions between the Company and other Emerson affiliates are included in the consolidated financial statements. See Note 16 for further details. As a business of Emerson, during the Predecessor period, Climate Technologies was charged for costs directly related to the Company and has been allocated a portion of Emerson’s general corporate costs. These costs are reflected in the consolidated and combined financial statements. The Company participated in various Emerson programs which include information technology services, employee benefits, medical insurance, and other programs. Costs associated with these programs were charged to the Company based on Emerson’s actual cost and the Company’s relative level of usage. The Company also utilized Emerson’s global shared service centers and was charged for direct costs and its share of facilities overhead. Emerson provided certain oversight and support services, including assistance with management strategy, logistics, marketing, finance, treasury, tax, human resources, legal and other activities. Emerson also charged royalties for use of Emerson’s trademarks and trade names and supply chain services. A charge for these services and royalties was allocated to the Company based principally on revenue. While management believes the methodologies and assumptions used to allocate these costs were reasonable, the consolidated and combined financial statements for the Predecessor period do not purport to represent the financial position, or the results of operations, changes in equity, and cash flows of the Company for the Successor period or in the future, or what they would have been had the Company operated as a standalone entity during the Predecessor periods presented. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed and consolidated financial statements include all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of operating results for the interim periods presented. Adjustments consist of normal and recurring accruals. The unaudited condensed and consolidated financial statements included herein do not include all disclosures required for interim financial statements presented in conformity with U.S. GAAP. However, the Company believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. The unaudited condensed and consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended September 30, 2023 and the notes thereto. The Company has applied the same accounting policies between Predecessor and Successor periods. Certain information has been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.",N/A,as_expected,2024,380

To achieve that objective, the company should disclose qualitative and quantitative information about its supplier finance programs. ----- The Company early adopted this standard on September 30, 2023, except for the amendment on roll forward information which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. See Note 10 for more information regarding the Company’s supplier finance program. There were no new accounting pronouncements adopted during the six months ended March 31, 2024 (Successor). **(2) BUSINESS COMBINATIONS** On October 30, 2022, the Company entered into a Transaction Agreement (“Transaction Agreement”) with Emerson, BCP Emerald Aggregator L.P. (“BCP”) and Merger Sub whereby BCP agreed to purchase, and Emerson agreed to sell, equity interests in JV NewCo following the Restructuring, for a purchase price of $13,647.1, as detailed below. The Acquisition was consummated on May 31, 2023 (the “Acquisition Date”). The Acquisition is accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting which requires, among other things, that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their estimated fair values (based on Level 3 measurements) as of the Acquisition Date. Additional information existing as of the Acquisition Date, but unknown to us, may become known during the remainder of the measurement period, not to exceed 12 months from the Acquisition Date, which may result in changes to the purchase price allocation. The following tables summarize the purchase consideration and the provisional purchase price allocation to estimated fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The preliminary calculation of the total consideration and allocation of the purchase price to the fair value of the Company’s assets acquired and liabilities assumed has not been completed. The detailed valuations necessary to estimate the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and, accordingly, the adjustments to record the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value reflects the best estimates based on the information currently available and are subject to change once additional analyses are completed. During the first six months of fiscal 2024, the Company identified and recorded certain immaterial measurement period adjustments based on changes to the preliminary assessment of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,380

The Company continues to take action to offset these headwinds including, but not limited to, implementing global pricing initiatives aimed at offsetting raw material costs.

During the three and six months ended March 31, 2024, the Company recognized $1.4 and $3.5, respectively, in sharebased compensation expense, which was reported in selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. All of this expense related to the Time-Vesting Options (described further below). There were certain Time-Vesting and Performance-Vesting Options (described further below) granted and forfeited during the three and six months ended March 31, 2024, described below. _Long-Term Incentive Plan_ Under the terms of the LTIP, employees are granted awards (the “LTIP Awards”) that become payable upon meeting both a service condition (the “LTIP Service Condition”) and a liquidity event condition (the “LTIP Liquidity Condition”). Awards issued under the LTIP have a maximum contractual term of the earlier to occur of the date on which the vested award amount has been settled or 7 years. LTIP Awards are liability classified since they allow for settlement in cash at the option of the Company. As of March 31, 2024, the unvested and outstanding Long-Term Incentive Plan Awards had an aggregate value of $16.1 of unrecognized share-based compensation expense. _Unit Incentive Plan_ The MIP allows for the issuance of up to 466,881,550 units. Under the terms of the MIP, employees are awarded stock options (“Options”) or Unit Appreciation Right awards (“UARs”). Awards issued under the MIP have a maximum ----- contractual term of 10 years. Options under the MIP are equity classified. UARs are liability classified since they require settlement in cash. Under the MIP, one half of the Options and UARs will vest in five (5) equal installments on the first through fifth anniversaries of the vesting commencement date, so long as the employee remains employed by the Company through the applicable vesting date (“Time-Vesting Units”). One half of the Options and UARs granted under the MIP may vest upon a liquidity event based on the extent that Blackstone Capital Partners VIII L.P. and its Affiliates (“Sponsor”) receives cash proceeds in respect of the Sponsor’s original investment in an amount that meets certain multiples on invested capital and internal rate of return hurdles subject to the recipient’s continued employment at the time the hurdles are met (“Performance-Vesting Units”). Additionally, with regard to the UARs, both the Time-Vesting Units and Performance-Vesting Units may only be exercised by an employee following a liquidity event. _Options_ Compensation expense for the Time-Vesting Units is recognized on a straight-line basis over the five-year requisite service period.

Management believes the methodologies and assumptions used to allocate costs to the Climate Technologies are reasonable. Emerson maintains a centralized information technology function that supports its business units. Services provided include application hosting, network support, network security, messaging and technology related services. Charges to Climate Technologies for these services were based on Emerson’s cost and the Climate Technologies’ actual usage.

As of March 31, 2024, the Company has three main classes of units, General Partner Units, issued to the general partner (“General Partner”), and Class P Units and Common Units, issued to the limited partners (“Limited Partners”). _General Partner Units_ The General Partner has the exclusive power and authority to manage and control the business and operations of the Company. The General Partner is authorized to create additional classes of equity units and can issue an unlimited number of units of any class. As of March 31, 2024, the Company has a singular issued and outstanding unit of General Partner Units. _Limited Partners’ Preferred Equity (Class P Units)_ Class P Units do not contain voting rights (subject to certain standard exceptions) but have priority with respect to rights on the distribution of assets and dividend upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation and dissolution. Class P Units accrete at an amount equal to 7% per annum. The holder of each Class P Unit has the option to, if permitted by the Class P majority holder, convert the units into Class A-1 Units to participate in tag-along rights of the General Partner LLC Agreement. In the occurrence of an initial public offering, if the price per share of common stock is greater than the Conversion Price, all outstanding Class P Units will automatically convert into an aggregate number of Class A-1 Units, determined by dividing the accreted amount of Class P Units by the Conversion Price (“Mandatory IPO Conversion”). If an initial public offering occurs but does not meet the conditions for Mandatory IPO Conversion, the class P majority holder can elect to have all of the Class P Units converted to Class A-1 Units in the same manner as if a Mandatory IPO Conversion occurs, or, alternatively, can elect to convert the Class P Units into a preferred security that pays interest at a 9% annual rate in cash, on the terms and conditions set forth in the Company’s limited partnership agreement. Upon a change in control or when the holder of Class P Unit elects to participate in tag-along rights, the Class P Units will automatically convert into Class A-1 Units in the amount equal to the greater of the accreted amount of Class P Units divided by the price per Class A-1 Unit or Conversion Price. The Company has 2.0 million Class P Units issued and outstanding as of March 31, 2024. _Conversion Price_ The “Conversion Price” for the Class P Units will be calculated as the product of 1.10 and the common equity consideration in connection with the Acquisition divided by the number of Class A-1 Units acquired by BCP Ruby Limited Partners. The initial and current Conversion Price for the Class P Units is $1.1 per share. The Conversion Price is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain anti-dilutive common stock events, including stock splits, the issuance of common stock dividends. _Limited Partners’ Common Equity (Common Units)_ Common Units consist of Class A-1 Units and Class A-2 Units. The Class A-2 Units are issued to management and do not contain voting rights. Common Units rank subsequent to holders of Class P units in any distributions or dividends.

The Company accrues for such liabilities when it is probable that future costs will be incurred and such costs can be reasonably estimated. Accruals are based on developments to date; management’s estimates of the outcomes of these matters; the Company’s experience in contesting, litigating and settling similar matters; and any related insurance coverage. While the Company believes a material adverse impact is unlikely, it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of these matters. Given the inherent uncertainty of litigation, a remote possibility exists that a future development could have a material adverse impact on the Company. The Company engages an outside expert to develop an actuarial estimate of its expected costs to resolve all pending and future asbestos claims, including defense costs, as well as its related insurance receivable. The reserve for asbestos litigation, which is recorded on an undiscounted basis, was $53.8 and the insurance receivable was $26.3 as of both March 31, 2024 (Successor) and September 30, 2023 (Successor). As part of the Transaction Agreement, Emerson has indemnified the Company for asbestos liabilities up to $75.0; with Emerson having the right to offset any such amount against the Emerson Notes. The Company anticipates the total amount of claims filed during the 7-year period will be $28.5 with a related insurance receivable of $10.0, and therefore an indemnification receivable equal to $18.5 has been recorded as of both September 30, 2023 and March 31, 2024. The Company is also responsible for environmental remediation at various facilities presently or formerly operated by the Company. The environmental remediation liability is recorded based upon the best estimate of costs to be incurred in light of the progress made in determining the magnitude of remediation costs, the timing, and extent of remedial actions required by governmental authorities. The actual costs the Company will incur are dependent on final determination of contamination and required remedial action, negotiations with governmental authorities with respect to cleanup levels, changes in regulatory requirements, innovations in investigatory and remedial technologies, effectiveness of remedial technologies employed, the ability of other responsible parties to pay, and any insurance or other third-party recoveries. As of March 31, 2024 (Successor) the Company has recorded, on an undiscounted basis, a total liability of $15.9 for environmental remediation-and related legal costs regarding these facilities. Approximately $3.3 and $12.6 was recorded in accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities, respectively. As of September 30, 2023 (Successor), the Company has recorded, on an undiscounted basis, a total liability of $16.6 for ----- environmental remediation-and related legal costs regarding these facilities. Approximately $3.7 and $12.9 was recorded in accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities, respectively. As of March 31, 2024 (Successor), there were no other known contingent liabilities (including guarantees and other claims) that management believes will be material in relation to the Company’s financial statements, nor were there any material commitments outside the normal course of business. **(18) ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)** Three Months Ended March 31, Six Months Ended March 31,",N/A,as_expected,2024,380
