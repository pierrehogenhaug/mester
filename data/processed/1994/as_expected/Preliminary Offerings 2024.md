### $2,750,000,000

# Panther Escrow Issuer, LLC

##### to be merged with and into
# Truist Insurance Holdings, LLC
 Panther Co-Issuer, Inc.
####      % Senior Secured Notes due 2031

Panther Escrow Issuer, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “Escrow Issuer”), and Panther Co-Issuer, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Panther
Co-Issuer” and, together with the Escrow Issuer, the “Escrow Issuers”), are offering $2,750,000,000 of    % senior secured notes due 2031 (the “notes”). The notes
will bear interest at a rate of   % per annum. The issuers (as defined herein) will pay interest on the notes semi-annually in cash in arrears on         and
of each year, beginning on        , 2024. The notes will mature on        , 2031.

This offering is part of the financing for the acquisition (the “Acquisition”) of Truist Insurance Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company
(“TIH” or the “Company”), by certain investment funds advised by Stone Point Capital LLC (“Stone Point”), certain investment funds advised by Clayton, Dubilier &
Rice, LLC (“CD&R” and, together with Stone Point, the “Sponsors” and each a “Sponsor”) and certain co-investors, pursuant to an equity interest purchase
agreement, dated as of February 20, 2024 (the “Acquisition Agreement”), by and among Truist Bank, a North Carolina-chartered state nonmember bank (“Truist”),
certain affiliates of the Sponsors (the “Buyer Entities”), the Company and the other parties thereto. Substantially concurrently with the consummation of the
Acquisition, the Escrow Issuer will be merged with and into TIH (the “Escrow Sub Merger”), with TIH continuing as the surviving company and with TIH and
McGriff Insurance Services, LLC (“McGriff Insurance”) assuming all the obligations of the Escrow Issuer under the notes and the indenture governing the notes.

This offering may be consummated prior to the consummation of the Acquisition. Unless the Acquisition will be consummated on the closing date of this
offering, on the closing date of this offering the Escrow Issuers will execute and deliver the Escrow Agreement (as defined herein) and will deposit, or cause to be
deposited, the gross proceeds from the offering of the notes into a segregated escrow account for the benefit of the holders of the notes pending the consummation of
the Acquisition (the “Escrow Account” and the funds deposited therein, the “Escrowed Property”). From the closing date of this offering to the Completion Date (as
defined herein), the Trustee, for its benefit and the benefit of the holders of the notes, will receive a first priority security interest in the Escrow Account and the
Escrowed Property. The release of the Escrowed Property to the Escrow Issuers to consummate the Acquisition will be subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions
(the “Escrow Conditions”), including the closing of the Acquisition substantially concurrently with or promptly following the release of such Escrowed Property. The
consummation of the Acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including, among others, the receipt of applicable regulatory approvals and the expiration
or termination of applicable waiting periods. If the Acquisition is not consummated on or prior to December 31, 2024 (the “Escrow Outside Date”), or upon the
occurrence of certain other events, the Escrowed Property will not be released to the Escrow Issuers to consummate the Acquisition but instead will be released to the
Trustee (as defined herein) for the purpose of redeeming the notes pursuant to a special mandatory redemption in accordance with the procedures set forth in the
indenture governing the notes. The special mandatory redemption price for the notes will be a price equal to 100% of the initial issue price of the notes plus accrued
and unpaid interest, if any, from the issue date of the notes to, but excluding, the special mandatory redemption date. Additional cash in respect of interest that would
accrue on the notes from and after the issue date of the notes will not be pre-funded into the Escrow Account on the issue date of the notes, but the Sponsors (directly
or through one or more of their affiliates) will commit on or prior to the closing date of this offering, in the event of a special mandatory redemption, to fund the
difference between the amounts in the Escrow Account that are available to be applied to redeem the notes pursuant to the special mandatory redemption and the
special mandatory redemption price plus the fees and expenses of the Trustee and the Escrow Agent. See “Description of the Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special
Mandatory Redemption.” Upon satisfaction of the Escrow Conditions or if the Acquisition is consummated on the closing date (if applicable), we intend to use the net
proceeds from this offering, together with borrowings under the Senior Credit Facilities (as defined herein) and the proceeds from the Equity Contribution (as defined
herein), to (i) finance and consummate the Transactions (as defined herein), (ii) pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions and (iii) fund cash
to the Company’s balance sheet. See “Summary—The Transactions” and “Use of Proceeds.”

The notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, on or after     , 2027 at the redemption prices specified under “Description of the Notes—Optional
Redemption,” plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. At any time prior to        , 2027, the issuers may redeem the notes,
in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of their principal amount plus a make-whole premium, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to,
but excluding the redemption date. In addition, the issuers may, at their option, redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes before        ,
2027 with an amount not to exceed the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings at the redemption price set forth under “Description of the Notes—Optional
Redemption,” plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. In addition, at any time prior to        , 2027, the issuers may redeem
up to 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes during each twelve-month period beginning on the issue date at a redemption price equal to 103% of the
aggregate principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. See “Description of the
Notes—Optional Redemption.” If we sell certain of our assets or experience specific kinds of changes of control, the issuers must offer to purchase the notes at the
prices set forth under “Description of the Notes—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change of Control” plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but
excluding, the date of purchase in such circumstances.


-----

Prior to the consummation of the Acquisition and pending the satisfaction of the Escrow Conditions (if applicable), the notes will be the obligations of the
Escrow Issuers and will not be guaranteed and will not otherwise be the beneficiary of any credit support from TIH, McGriff Insurance or any of their subsidiaries.
Upon the consummation of the Acquisition, the Escrow Issuer will merge with and into TIH, with TIH surviving such Escrow Sub Merger, and TIH and McGriff
Insurance will assume all the obligations of the Escrow Issuer under the notes and the indenture governing the notes.

From and after the consummation of the Acquisition and following the satisfaction of the Escrow Conditions (if applicable), obligations under the notes
will be guaranteed (the “guarantees”) on a senior secured basis, jointly and severally, by: (i) Panther Platform Holdco, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership and the
Escrow Issuer’s indirect parent (“Holdings”); (ii) Panther Platform Midco, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership and the Escrow Issuer’s parent (“ParentCo”); (iii) each
of ParentCo’s existing and future wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries that guarantee the obligations of the issuers under the Senior Credit Facilities or
certain other indebtedness, subject to certain exceptions (other than Panther Co-Issuer, which will be a guarantor under the Senior Credit Facilities and a co-issuer of
the notes); and (iv) any future wholly-owned domestic subsidiary of Holdings of which ParentCo is a subsidiary (an “intermediate parent”) that guarantees the
obligations of the issuers under the Senior Credit Facilities.

Following consummation of the Acquisition, the notes and the guarantees will be secured on a first lien pari passu basis by (i) all of the equity securities
of ParentCo, the issuers, any intermediate parent and the subsidiary guarantors (as defined herein) and (ii) substantially all assets of Holdings, ParentCo, the issuers,
any intermediate parent and the subsidiary guarantors (other than any Excluded Assets (as defined herein)), which assets will also secure the issuers’ and the
guarantors’ obligations under the First Lien Credit Facilities (as defined herein) on a first lien basis and the Second Lien Term Loan Facility (as defined herein) on a
second lien basis, subject to permitted liens. Following consummation of the Acquisition, the notes and the guarantees will be senior secured obligations of the issuers
and the guarantors, rank equally in right of payment with all of the issuers’ and the guarantors’ existing and future senior indebtedness, including the Senior Credit
Facilities, be effectively senior to all of the issuers’ and the guarantors’ existing and future unsecured indebtedness and junior lien indebtedness, including the Second
Lien Term Loan Facility, to the extent of the value of the assets securing the notes and the First Lien Credit Facilities, rank pari passu with all of the issuers’ and each
guarantor’s existing and future obligations secured on a first lien basis on the collateral securing the notes, including the First Lien Credit Facilities, and rank senior in
right of payment to any indebtedness subordinated to the notes. In addition, following consummation of the Acquisition, the notes and the guarantees will be
structurally subordinated to the existing and future indebtedness, claims of holders of preferred stock and other liabilities of any subsidiary of ParentCo that is not a
guarantor of the notes.

**Investing in the notes involves a high degree of risk. See “Risk Factors” beginning on page 25.**

**Offering Price for the Notes:      % plus accrued interest, if any, from the issue date.**

securities laws of any other jurisdiction. The notes are being offered and sold to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule
144A under the Securities Act (“Rule 144A”) and to certain non-U.S. persons in transactions outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities
Act (“Regulation S”). Prospective purchasers that are qualified institutional buyers are hereby notified that the sellers of the notes may be relying on the exemption
from Section 5 of the Securities Act pursuant to Rule 144A. For a description of certain information about eligible offerees and restrictions on transfers of the notes,
see “Transfer Restrictions” and “Plan of Distribution.”

Currently, there is no public market for the notes. We do not intend to apply for listing of the notes on any securities exchange or for inclusion of the

**NOTICE TO INVESTORS**

You should rely only on the information contained in this offering memorandum. None of the Escrow
Issuers, the issuers, the guarantors or the initial purchasers has authorized anyone to provide you with any
information or represent anything about the Escrow Issuers, the issuers, the guarantors, our financial results or this
offering that is not contained in this offering memorandum. If given or made, any such other information or
representation should not be relied upon as having been authorized by the Escrow Issuers, the issuers, the guarantors
or the initial purchasers. None of the Escrow Issuers, the issuers, the guarantors or the initial purchasers is making
an offer to sell these notes in any jurisdiction where the offer or sale is not permitted. The information contained in
this offering memorandum speaks only as of the date of the document containing such information. Our business,
financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and prospects may have changed subsequent to any such date.

It is expected that delivery of the notes will be made against payment therefor on or about the date specified
on the cover of this offering memorandum, which is the      business day following the date of pricing of the
notes (such settlement cycle being referred to as “T+   ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two
business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to
trade the notes prior to the date that is two business days preceding the settlement date will be required, by virtue of
the fact that the notes will not initially settle in T+2, to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such
trade to prevent failed settlement. Purchasers of the notes who wish to trade the notes prior to their date of delivery
hereunder should consult their own advisors. See “Plan of Distribution.”

with the proposed offering of the notes described herein, and solely for use in connection with the offer of the notes
to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A and to certain non-U.S. persons
outside the United States under Regulation S. This offering memorandum is confidential and personal to each
offeree and does not constitute an offer or solicitation of an offer from any other person or the public generally to
subscribe for or otherwise acquire the notes. Distribution of this offering memorandum to any person other than the
offeree and those persons, if any, retained to advise such offeree with respect thereto is unauthorized, and any

and (v) you may not reproduce or distribute this offering memorandum, in whole or in part, and you may not
disclose any of the contents of this offering memorandum or use any information herein for any purpose other than
considering the purchase of the notes.

We make no representation to you that the notes are a legal investment for you. You should not consider
any information in this offering memorandum to be legal, business, tax or other advice. You should consult your
own attorney, business advisor and tax advisor for legal, business, tax or other advice regarding an investment in the

offering memorandum.

Each prospective purchaser of the notes must comply with all applicable laws and regulations in force in

the notes will be issued in the form of one or more registered global notes. The global notes will be deposited with
the registrar, as custodian for DTC as depositary, and registered in the name of Cede & Co. or another nominee of
such depositary. Beneficial interests in the global notes will be shown on, and transfers of beneficial interests in the
global notes will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC and its participants. After the initial issuance
of the global notes, certificated notes will be issued in exchange for global notes only in the limited circumstances
set forth in the applicable indenture that will govern the notes. See “Book Entry, Delivery and Form.”

You should contact the initial purchasers with any questions about this offering or if you require additional
information to verify the information contained in this offering memorandum.

We reserve the right to withdraw this offering of the notes at any time. We and the initial purchasers also
reserve the right to reject any offer to purchase the notes in whole or in part for any reason and to allot to any
prospective investor less than the full amount of notes sought by such investor.

**THE SECURITIES OFFERED HEREBY HAVE NOT BEEN RECOMMENDED BY ANY UNITED**
**STATES FEDERAL OR STATE SECURITIES COMMISSION OR REGULATORY AUTHORITY.**
**FURTHERMORE, THE FOREGOING AUTHORITIES HAVE NOT CONFIRMED THE ACCURACY OR**
**DETERMINED THE ADEQUACY OF THIS DOCUMENT. ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE**
**CONTRARY IS A CRIMINAL OFFENSE. THERE ARE NO REGISTRATION RIGHTS ASSOCIATED**
**WITH THE NOTES OR THE GUARANTEES.**

The distribution of this offering memorandum and the offering and sale of the notes in certain jurisdictions
may be restricted by law. We and the initial purchasers require persons in whose possession this offering
memorandum comes to inform themselves about and to observe any such restrictions. This offering memorandum
does not constitute an offer of, or an invitation to purchase, any of the notes in any jurisdiction in which such offer
or invitation would be unlawful.


-----

**NO REVIEW BY THE SEC; NO REGISTRATION RIGHTS**

This offering memorandum, as well as any other documents in connection with this offering, will not be
reviewed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). There are no registration rights associated with
the notes or the guarantees and we have no present intention to offer to exchange the notes and the guarantees for
notes and guarantees registered under the Securities Act or to file a registration statement with respect to the notes.
The indenture that will govern the notes will not be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the
“Trust Indenture Act”). This offering memorandum does not contain pro forma financial statements which would be
required by Article 11 of Regulation S-X if this offering was being made pursuant to a registration statement filed
with the SEC. The Acquisition will be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting for business
combinations. Under this method of accounting, the aggregate transaction consideration will be allocated to the
business’ assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the date of completion of
the Acquisition. These adjustments are not presented in this offering memorandum but may be significant.

**NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES**

In addition to financial information presented in accordance with United States generally accepted
accounting principles (“GAAP”), such as total revenues and net income, we use EBITDA, Excluding Discontinued
Operations, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue and Free Cash Flow
(each of which is a non-GAAP financial measure) in our evaluation of past performance and prospects for the future.

    - _EBITDA, Excluding Discontinued Operations is defined as net income adjusted for interest, taxes,_
depreciation and amortization and certain discontinued operations.

    - _Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA, Excluding Discontinued Operations as further adjusted for_
effects of impairment loss on goodwill, acquisitions, interest income on fiduciary cash, stock-based
compensation, transaction and restructuring expenses, producer loan amortization, non-operating
income/expense, accrual for performance-based contingent earnout obligations, one-time separation
costs and standalone audit adjustments.

    - _Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA is defined as Adjusted EBITDA as further adjusted for new producer_
excess compensation, standalone company costs, expense reduction initiatives and the other
adjustments set forth in “Summary—Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Information.”

    - _Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Margin is defined as the ratio of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA to Pro_
Forma Adjusted Revenue.

    - _Free Cash Flow is defined as Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA less certain buy-side adjustments,_
identified cost savings and capital expenditures.

    - _Organic Revenue is defined as commissions and fees (excluding contingent commissions) as further_
adjusted to exclude commissions and fees from acquired and divested businesses in the 12 months
following the acquisition or divestiture of such business.

    - _Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue is defined as revenue as adjusted for certain discontinued operations, the_
effect of acquisitions and other adjustments set forth in “Summary—Summary Historical Consolidated
Financial Information.”

Our non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or
superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. They are not measurements of our financial
performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss) or revenue, as
applicable, or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to
other similarly titled measures of other businesses. These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as
analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results
as reported under GAAP and they include adjustments for items that may occur in future periods. However, we


-----

believe these adjustments are appropriate because the amounts recognized can vary significantly from period to
period, do not directly relate to the ongoing operations of our business and complicate comparisons of our internal
operating results and operating results of other peer companies over time.

We believe that our presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplemental
information to investors and management regarding our financial condition and results of operations. For a more
detailed discussion, see “Summary—Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Information.”

**INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA**

The market data and other statistical information used throughout this offering memorandum are based on
independent industry publications, government publications, reports by market research firms and other published
independent sources. Some data is also based on our good faith estimates, which are derived from our review of
internal surveys and independent sources. Although we believe these sources are reliable, we have not independently
verified the information, nor have we ascertained the underlying economic assumptions relied upon therein. In
addition, while we believe that the industry information included herein is generally reliable, such information is
inherently imprecise. While we are not aware of any misstatements regarding the industry data presented herein, our
estimates involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various factors, including those
discussed under the captions “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” in this
offering memorandum.

business. All service marks, trademarks and trade names referred to in this offering memorandum are the property of

We are one of the leading insurance brokers in the United States and provide a broad array of insurance
products and services (including property and casualty (“P&C”), employee benefits, life and title insurance) through
our diversified distribution channels (retail brokerage (“Retail”), wholesale brokerage (“Wholesale”), specialty
programs (“Specialty Programs”) and title (“Title”)). Founded in 1922, we are the fifth largest insurance broker in
the United States by 2022 brokerage revenue and have strong market positions across the insurance distribution
chain. Our business is highly diversified across producers, clients, carriers and geographies, and we serve
corporations, small and medium-sized enterprises, and individuals through nearly 10,000 talented employees. We
have also demonstrated a robust growth trajectory throughout our history with approximately 5% average annual
organic revenue growth over the last 10 years and approximately 8% average annual organic revenue growth over
the last three and five years. In 2023, we placed over $50 billion of premiums, resulting in total revenue of $3,467
million, net income of $210 million, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA of $1,178 million and a Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA margin of 34.1%.

Our operations are comprised of robust capabilities across our Retail brokerage, Wholesale brokerage,
Specialty Programs and Title businesses. Through our businesses we deliver end-to-end coverage across the
insurance distribution chain, making us well positioned to serve our clients. We have an insurance distribution
business model and do not retain any underwriting risk on our balance sheet. Each of our business units is described
in further detail below.

**_Retail Brokerage (36% of Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue in 2023)_**

Through our Retail brokerage business, we maintain primary relationships with clients who seek to
purchase insurance. We serve a wide range of clients, including large multinational corporations, small- and
medium-sized enterprises and individual consumers. We assist our clients by placing diverse insurance coverages
through our network of admitted carriers as well as through wholesalers, MGAs and managing general underwriters
(“MGUs”) for complex and specialized insurance risks. MGAs and MGUs perform similar roles, generally known in
the insurance industry and will hereinafter be collectively referred to as “MGA”.

Our Retail brokerage operations are organized under the McGriff Insurance brand. McGriff Insurance is a
leading retail agency with an operating history spanning over 100 years. Through McGriff Insurance, we have a
scaled business that operates in all 50 states with over 3,500 employees, over 90 offices and a sizeable presence in
the mid-Atlantic and Southeast regions of the United States. We believe that our network of approximately 700
producers provides the basis for deep, embedded local relationships and “trusted advisor” status with our clients.

McGriff Insurance’s brokerage services encompass commercial lines, employee benefits and personal lines.
Commercial lines represented 71% of McGriff Insurance’s Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue in 2023. Commercial lines
are offered nationally with a focus on upper middle market and large clients, and feature strong specialty practices in
aviation, construction, energy & marine, executive risk, private equity, real estate & hospitality, surety,
transportation and senior living. Employee benefits represented 22% of McGriff Insurance’s Pro Forma Adjusted
Revenue in 2023. McGriff Insurance offers a full suite of employee benefits consulting and brokerage capabilities,
serving over 10,000 clients nationally. Personal lines represented 7% of McGriff Insurance’s Pro Forma Adjusted
Revenue in 2023. McGriff Insurance’s personal line offerings provide insurance and financial planning solutions to
mass-affluent and high net worth individuals nationally.


-----

Our Retail brokerage business placed approximately $13 billion of premiums in 2023, resulting in $1,217
million, or 36%, of Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue in 2023 and an 8% Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue compound
annual growth rate (“CAGR”) from 2021 to 2023. Organic revenue growth in our Retail brokerage business was
approximately 9% in 2023, reflecting strong underlying drivers, which include approximately 94% revenue
retention, approximately 88% producer retention and 78 gross producer hires in 2023.

**_Wholesale Brokerage (46% of Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue in 2023)_**

We are a leading distributor of specialty insurance products and services through our Wholesale brokerage
business. Our extensive knowledge of the specialty insurance market allows us to act as an intermediary on behalf of
retail producers, assisting in the delivery of cost-effective coverage solutions for complex, specialized risks. With
4,400 employees as of December 31, 2023, our Wholesale brokerage business has extensive expertise across a wide
range of industries to facilitate placement of P&C coverages, as well as life, retirement and benefits products. In
2023, our Wholesale brokerage business placed over $36 billion of premiums and generated $1,568 million, or 46%,
of Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue during 2023, which resulted in a 9% Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue CAGR from
2021 to 2023.

Our Wholesale brokerage business is structured into two divisions: CRC Commercial Solutions (“CRC”)
and Life, Retirement & Benefit Solutions (“LRB”). CRC represented 78% of our Wholesale brokerage Pro Forma
Adjusted Revenue in 2023, and LRB represented the remaining 22% of Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue.

Through CRC, we are the third largest P&C wholesale broker in the United States by 2022 premium
volume, placing approximately $13 billion of premiums in 2023. CRC is a leading provider of specialty brokerage
services across property, casualty and professional lines of business. Through our affiliated CRC Binding and Tapco
brands, we also offer direct access to open-brokerage capabilities, in-house binding facilities and MGA facilities for
numerous commercial insurance classes and lines of coverage. CRC had an 11% revenue CAGR from 2021 to 2023.

CRC maintains extensive relationships with retail producers and insurance carriers through a national
network of 750 producers sitting across nearly 100 offices. Our size, scale and strong relationships within the
insurance marketplace enhance our ability to provide customers with comprehensive access to these markets. We
also leverage our product expertise, relationships with carriers and proprietary data to structure new insurance
programs and products to respond to opportunities in the marketplace. Via our Insurisk brand, we leverage data
collected from CRC’s business to provide 15 exclusive products to CRC producers. We also maintain a proprietary
data and analytics platform called REDY that harnesses millions of data points on wholesale products, spanning
dozens of coverages and thousands of industries, to deliver valuable and actional intelligence to our producers and
provide a distinct competitive advantage in the marketplace.

LRB is comprised of two leading brands in the life, retirement and benefits space. Crump is a leading thirdparty distributor and service provider of life insurance retirement products in the United States, while BenefitMall is
a leading wholesale employee benefits platform.

**_Specialty Programs (15% of Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue in 2023)_**

We operate a variety of specialty insurance programs wherein insurance carriers have authorized us to
perform certain functions on their behalf – including underwriting, pricing, and binding – for designated risks. Our
authority to perform these functions is usually subject to underwriting guidelines, policy limits and pricing
parameters that are developed jointly with our carrier partners and are specific to each program.

When our subsidiaries and programs serve as an MGA, we generally act as an intermediary between retail
and wholesale brokers who request insurance coverages and carriers who provide balance sheet capacity. If we are
able to bind coverages, we issue policies on behalf of the insurance carriers we represent. Because we operate on
behalf of the insurance carriers, our programs do not take underwriting risk for the policies we bind.

Our Specialty Programs business is one of the largest MGA platforms in the United States by 2022
premium volume with $5.4 billion of premiums written in 2023 spread across more than 40 programs. We have a


-----

highly diversified business mix comprised of 46% property, 10% construction, 10% transportation, 9% reinsurance,
9% professional lines, 6% marine and energy, 4% real estate and 6% other lines for 2023 premiums. In 2023, our
Specialty Programs business generated $505 million, or 15%, of Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue. Our Specialty
Programs business had an approximate 8% Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue CAGR from 2021 to 2023, excluding the
recently acquired Wellington Risk Insurance Agency (“Wellington”) (which is housed within AmRisc ). As of
December 31, 2023, over 760 employees were part of the Specialty Programs business.

Our Specialty Programs division operates through two divisions: AmRisc and Starwind. During 2023,
AmRisc generated $262 million of Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue, of which $27 million was contributed by
Wellington (which is housed within AmRisc), and Starwind generated $216 million of Pro Forma Adjusted
Revenue.

AmRisc is one of the largest property catastrophe MGAs in the United States with $2.6 billion of total
premiums written during 2023. Of these premiums, approximately $2.3 billion are allocated to commercial lines.
Commercial lines are offered by AmRisc and its related brands, which include Chronos Retail, Waypoint
Wholesale, and AmRisc Online. The remaining $264 million of AmRisc’s premiums are allocated to admitted
personal lines, which are offered under the Wellington brand. Wellington was acquired by AmRisc in 2021 and is
focused on providing coverages for the Texas homeowners’ market. AmRisc has a strong track record of
underwriting profitability and, together with Wellington, employed over 140 specialist underwriters as of December
31, 2023. AmRisc posted a 7% CAGR for commissions and fees between 2021 and 2023, excluding Wellington.

Starwind is a leading casualty-focused specialty program manager focused on underwriting and distributing
complex insurance solutions through dozens of specialized MGAs. Starwind provides specialty products across
multiple industries with a full suite of services comprising underwriting, distribution and claims management. As of
December 31, 2023, over 30 insurance brands were managed by Starwind, including Prime Specialty and Venture
Underwriters for contractor general liability and excess liability, Continental Underwriters for tailored marine,
inland marine, excess liability and cargo, Norman-Spencer for real estate professional and wholesale brokerage,
Aspen Insurance for personal auto and personal property, Allstar Transportation Specialists for E&S trucking,
Coastal Insurance Underwriters for homeowners and condominium associations as well as golf and country clubs,
and Allstar Underwriters for commercial auto, homeowners and commercial property. Starwind posted a 12% Pro
Forma Adjusted Revenue CAGR between 2021 and 2023.

**_Title (3% of Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue in 2023)_**

Our Title business operates through Kensington Vanguard National Land Services, an independent
commercial title agency in the United States. Kensington Vanguard National Land Services serves as an agent to the
nation’s largest title insurance underwriters, providing commercial and residential title insurance as well as other
related services. In 2023, our Title business generated $92 million of Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue, or 3%, of Pro
Forma Adjusted Revenue.

**Our Industry**

We operate our business within the U.S. insurance brokerage industry. We primarily compete for business
on the basis of reputation, relationships, client service, expertise, product offerings, and the ability to tailor our
products and risk management services to meet the needs of clients. Through our Retail brokerage business, we
compete with a number of insurance brokerage firms that focus on delivering services to Fortune 1000 and mediumsized companies, including large publicly traded brokers (such as Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc., Aon plc,
Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company, Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. and Brown & Brown, Inc.), large
privately held brokerage businesses and other small locally-owned agencies. Through our Wholesale brokerage
business, we compete with a number of other wholesale brokerage firms such as Ryan Specialty Holdings, Inc.
(publicly traded), Amwins Group, Inc. (privately held) and others, as well as retail brokerage firms that distribute
products similar to the types of products we distribute and insurance carriers that distribute these products directly
through retail producers. Through our Specialty Programs business, we compete with a variety of sources for
standard and specialized insurance products with similar coverages. In many cases, our competitors are MGAs,
wholesale brokerage firms and insurance carriers.


-----

**_P&C Insurance Brokerage Market_**

P&C insurance in the United States is sold by two types of insurance carriers: those that are state licensed
(“admitted”) and those that operate beyond state licensing (“non-admitted”). Admitted carriers typically sell
standard insurance products for which insurance rates and risk coverages are relatively uniform and must comply
with applicable laws and, in certain states, regulatory approval. Non-admitted carriers typically engage in the excess
and surplus (“E&S”) lines market, taking on relatively specialized and complex risks that do not fit the underwriting
criteria of standard insurance products.

Through the scope of our business activities as an insurance broker, we provide products and services to
both the admitted and non-admitted insurance markets. Insurance brokers act as intermediaries between insureds and
insurance carriers. Retail producers place P&C insurance coverages on behalf of businesses, public institutions and
individual clients, negotiating with carriers for competitive rates and policy terms. Retail producers are typically
compensated through commissions paid by carriers on the premium that is placed; however, they can also be paid on
a fee basis for their insurance placement and other risk consultation services. Wholesale insurance brokers act as
intermediaries between insurance carriers and retail producers by assisting retail producers in placing business that is
outside of their core expertise or ability to place directly. Wholesale insurance brokers often provide retail insurance
brokers with specialty and E&S insurance products. Wholesale brokers are typically compensated by commissions
paid by the insurance carrier, although they can also receive fees in addition to commissions for placing certain
insurance policies. In some cases, brokers can act as an MGA for insurance carriers. An MGA generally has
authority to bind coverage on behalf of an insurance carrier for a specific type of risk, subject to agreed-upon
guidelines and limits. An MGA generally does not assume underwriting risk for the products that it distributes.

Historically, despite economic ebbs and flows, the P&C insurance sector has demonstrated resilient and
stable growth. Total U.S. P&C direct written premiums increased each year between 1996 and 2023 (except during
the 2008 global financial crisis), resulting in a 4.4% CAGR from 1996 to 2022. P&C premium growth tends to be
less volatile than changes in insurance rates, which can fluctuate during soft and hard markets. During periods of
declining premium rates (known as soft markets), insureds tend to increase limits on coverages, purchase new
coverages and reduce deductibles. Conversely, during periods of increasing premium rates (known as hard markets),
insureds typically lower coverages and maintain higher deductibles. Combined with overall economic growth, these
dynamics have led to stable growth in P&C premiums over time.

The P&C insurance brokerage market has seen a large amount of consolidation activity over the last decade
as the industry shifts from a high degree of fragmentation to one where scaled, national platforms command a
growing share of the market. However, despite substantial consolidation, more than 40,000 independent brokerage
agencies were operating in the United States in 2022, an increase from 36,000 in 2020. We believe that this provides
a stable basis for ongoing M&A activity in the sector.

**_Employee Benefits Market_**

Employee benefits brokers and consultants primarily cater to companies and their employees by offering a
suite of health-related insurance products, including medical, life and disability coverages, as well as overseeing
retirement and asset management programs. These experts act both as intermediaries and strategic planners, offering
guidance on structuring benefit plans. As all-in-one solution providers, they enable middle-market businesses to
outsource the complexities of benefits planning, oversight and administration, thus allowing these businesses to
bypass the need for extensive internal infrastructure or significant investments in technology.

Demand for employee benefits offerings is largely driven by overall employment levels. The primary driver
of pricing for these products and services is healthcare spending. The design and execution of employee benefit
strategies have become increasingly nuanced, especially against the backdrop of ongoing healthcare inflation and
increased regulatory complexity. This evolving landscape underscores the growing relevance of adept benefits
brokers with strong service offerings and expertise.

**Our Strengths**

**_Scaled Platform with Market Leading Positions Across the Insurance Distribution Chain_**

We are the fifth largest insurance broker in the United States by 2022 brokerage revenue with over $50
billion in premium volume and approximately $3.5 billion of revenue in 2023. We believe that our reputation, built
through more than 100 years of operating history, as well as our size and scale grant us a distinct advantage in the
marketplace, enabling us to better assist our clients while deepening our engagement with insurance carriers. As we
continue to pursue our goals of increasing both our market share with clients and the depth of our relationships with
insurance carriers, we expect to further enhance our value proposition by providing heightened access to both
constituents. We believe we provide such enhanced access through a network of more than 2,000 producers and over
450 underwriters based in over 200 locations across the United States as of December 31, 2023. We also maintain
over 40,000 wholesale agent relationships as of December 31, 2023.

We have robust capabilities across the insurance distribution chain, which we believe make us well
positioned to better serve our clients while capturing a greater proportion of commission revenues. Our key brands
include McGriff Insurance (a top 15 retail broker by 2022 brokerage revenue), CRC (a top 3 P&C wholesale broker
by 2022 premium volume), AmRisc (a leading property catastrophe MGA), Starwind (a leading program manager),
Crump (a leading life wholesaler), BenefitMall (a leading employee benefits wholesaler) and Kensington Vanguard
(an independent commercial title agency). Through these brands, we are the fifth largest broker in the United States
by 2022 brokerage revenue, the largest multiline wholesale broker in the United States by 2022 premium volume
and one of the largest MGA programs in the United States by 2022 premium volume.

**_Highly Diversified Business Model_**

Our revenue base is highly diversified across distribution channels, lines of business, geographies, clients,
end markets, producers and carriers, among other factors. Our diversification ensures limited reliance on any
particular product, distribution channel, customer, or market, reducing our exposure to any adverse industry
developments and macroeconomic factors and thereby mitigating volatility in our overall financial performance. In
addition, the breadth of our offerings provides us with various avenues through which we can identify gaps in the
market and develop specialized products to capture unmet demand.

1) P&C represents CRC, Specialty Programs and McGriff Insurance (excluding employee benefits). Employee benefits represents McGriff
Insurance’s employee benefits business and BenefitMall. Life represents Crump. Title represents Kensington Vanguard.
2) Top 30 rankings exclude Lloyd’s market.


-----

Given the diversification of our business model, we are well positioned to channel premiums across several
distribution channels in situations that would benefit our clients. Ultimately, this enables us to better serve our
clients by providing enhanced coverage and placement for their risks while also allowing us to capture a greater
proportion of economics from the value chain. In 2023, McGriff Insurance placed approximately $1 billion of
premiums into CRC, 8% of CRC’s total premium. In the same year, McGriff Insurance placed approximately $54
million of premiums into Starwind, 2% of Starwind’s total premium. Similarly, CRC placed approximately $580
million of premiums with AmRisc, 23% of Amrisc’s total premium, and approximately $280 million of premiums
with Starwind, 9% of Starwind’s total premium.

**_Long-Term Track Record of Growth with Continued Secular Tailwinds_**

We have a long-term track record of consistent growth. Over the last 19 years, we have demonstrated a
robust growth trajectory with a 9.5% total revenue CAGR and 4.2% average annual organic growth.

We have a demonstrated track record of growing organically across P&C and economic market cycles. Our
average organic revenue growth was 8%, 8% and 5% over the last 3, 5 and 10 years, respectively. We benefit from
the non-discretionary nature of insurance coverage and employee benefits, which we believe creates relatively
stable, consistent demand for our offerings across P&C and economic market cycles. We also believe we benefit
from distinct advantages in the marketplace driven by our longstanding reputation, scale, depth of relationships,
client service, expertise, and product offerings.

_____________


-----

1) Based on P&C direct premiums written.
2) Based on annual average commercial P&C rate changes.

We believe that our organic revenue growth compares favorably to large, publicly traded insurance brokers
with whom we compete (such as Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc., Aon plc, Willis Towers Watson Public
Limited Company, Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. and Brown & Brown, Inc.). Since 2018, we have generated higher
annual organic revenue growth compared to the median of large, publicly traded peer brokerage segments. Our
average annual organic revenue growth between 2018 and 2023 was 7.3%, including our Title and Wellington
businesses, and 7.8% excluding these businesses. This compares favorably to a public peer composite average of
6.8%. We believe that our outperformance is driven by our diversified business model and strong growth across our
wholesale P&C and MGA businesses.

_____________

1) Represents TIH organic revenue growth excluding the Title and Wellington businesses.
2) Represents the median organic revenue growth for the brokerage segments of Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc., Aon plc, Willis
Towers Watson Public Limited Company, Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. and Brown & Brown, Inc. per public filings.

We believe that a combination of secular tailwinds, in addition to our identified growth initiatives, will help
to sustain our strong organic growth trajectory.

_Market Share Growth for E&S Lines and MGAs. Insurance risks are becoming increasingly complex and_
specialized given the impacts of globalization and technological change, among other factors. As a result, E&S lines
are becoming more prevalent in the United States, resulting in higher market share. In 2022, $98 billion of direct
premiums written were in E&S lines, representing 11% of P&C premiums in the United States. This is nearly double
the $45 billion of E&S direct written premiums in 2017, which comprised 7% of P&C premiums at the time.
Similarly, utilization of MGAs is increasing as a means of efficiently underwriting and placing complex risks. Direct
written premiums channeled through MGAs in the United States grew from $43 billion in 2017 to $86 billion in
2022, reflecting a growth in market share from 7% to 10% of total P&C premiums. We believe these trends have
generated a sustained tailwind for our organic growth given the weighting of our product mix and distribution
channels.

_P&C Pricing Environment. The P&C sector is currently characterized by a hard market with a general_
upward trend in pricing. The average premium rate change for commercial P&C products was 10.6% in 2020, 9.0%
in 2021, 7.5% in 2022 and 8.4% in 2023. We believe uplifts in pricing for the coverages we sell generate favorable
impacts on our organic growth.

_Broker Commission Rates. Broker commission rates have gradually increased over time and have_
demonstrated resilience amid the current hard market environment, reflecting the strong value proposition delivered


-----

by brokerage firms to clients and carriers. Direct commission rates for commercial P&C lines were 13.3% in 2019,
13.2% in 2020, 13.4% in 2021 and 13.6% in 2022, which compared favorably to 12.1% in 2011. We believe higher
brokerage commission rates create a tailwind for our organic growth.

In addition to strong organic growth, our growth has also been propelled historically by acquiring and
developing key capabilities that have enhanced the scale of our platform and the depth and breadth of our offerings.

**_Strong Financial Performance and Recurring Free Cash Flow Generation_**

We have a sustained track record of delivering strong growth in total revenue and Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA. Our Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA margin was 34.1% in 2023. Combined with limited capital
expenditures, working capital requirements and cash tax obligations, we believe we are able to generate highly
visible cash flows that can be used to drive organic growth, fund highly accretive acquisitions and repay debt. Our
Free Cash Flow as a percentage of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA was 97.5% in 2021, 98.1% in 2022 and 91.3% in
2023.

**_Seasoned, Aligned Management Team_**

We have a high-quality management team led by John Howard (Chairman and CEO) and Dave Obenauer
(Vice Chairman and President), supported by a deep bench of industry veterans averaging more than 25 years of
experience. In addition, we expect to benefit from the significant knowledge and experience of our Sponsors. We are
committed to maintaining strong alignment throughout our organization by providing meaningful equity ownership
across the management team and our top 1,500 producers and employees.

**Our Strategies**

**_Continued Execution of Organic Growth Initiatives_**

We are highly focused on driving organic growth across our business. Key components of our organic
growth strategy include: (1) enhanced cross-sell to existing clients across all of our operations, (2) development of
new programs and products given opportunities in the marketplace, and (3) producer recruitment and retention.

We have a long and successful track record of attracting and retaining producer talent. Since January 2019,
we have hired over 360 producers at McGriff Insurance and over 270 brokers at CRC. The McGriff Insurance
producer hires generated $103 million of revenue in 2023, representing approximately 9% of McGriff Insurance’s
total commissions and fees during 2023. The CRC broker hires generated $128 million of revenue in 2023,
representing 10.7% of CRC’s total commissions and fees during 2023. Producer recruiting activity remained strong
in 2023 following Stone Point’s minority investment and implementation of the new TIH equity incentive plan.
Voluntary producer attrition has improved as well since the initial equity investment by Stone Point. We believe we
have a significant opportunity to accelerate producer recruiting by leveraging our new equity incentive plan and
additional investment in recruiting personnel and programs.

**_Disciplined Acquisition Strategy_**

We believe that we can enhance the strength and diversification of our platform by acquiring new
capabilities and entering new regional markets. As such, we engage in discussions with potential acquisition targets
on an ongoing basis. To successfully execute our acquisition strategy, we have developed a disciplined approach to
evaluating and integrating acquisitions. An acquisition candidate must meet a number of financial and non-financial
criteria to be considered a viable candidate. We target acquisitions that we believe will add to the strength of our
platform while having the potential to generate strong financial performance in the future.

**_Foster an Equity Culture_**

We instituted a new equity incentive plan and a co-investment program in conjunction with Stone Point’s
initial equity investment in April 2023. Both programs have served to enhance alignment across our organization


-----

and drive higher producer retention and recruitment. As of December 31, 2023, over 1,500 of our employees and
producers participate in our equity incentive plan and approximately 90 key leaders and producers have invested
meaningful equity amounts alongside Stone Point through our co-investment program. In connection with the
Transactions, we expect to implement an expanded equity incentive plan and co-investment program to drive further
alignment and equity ownership across the producer base. Management will also be rolling a significant portion of
their proceeds as part of the Rollover.

**_Enhance Operational Efficiency and Profitability_**

We have a track record of managing operating expenses effectively and driving continuous margin
improvement over time. In 2023, we initiated a series of expense and efficiency initiatives to streamline our
operations and increase operating leverage without impacting revenue. As of December 31, 2023, we have identified
$96 million of expense reductions. Of this amount, $61 million of reductions have been actioned in 2023 (or are
scheduled to be actioned in the first quarter of 2024) and $7 million have been realized in 2023. Key cost saving
categories include: (1) targeted reductions in force of duplicative leadership and unprofitable producers across all
business units, (2) rationalization of real estate footprint and consolidation of overlapping offices, (3) tightened
oversight of travel and entertainment spend, and (4) third party vendor contract optimization. Viewing the $96
million of expected expense reductions holistically, 53% relates to organizational restructuring, 21% relates to
additional outsourcing, 3% relates to real estate rationalization and 23% relates to other initiatives. Additionally, we
have identified an incremental $28 million of potential expense reductions, which we expect to action in 2024,
including $20 million in possible savings from outsourcing or offshoring non-client facing functions, $3 million of
expected additional real estate rationalization savings and approximately $5 million of potential information
technology savings. We believe there is a significant opportunity to improve profitability and drive efficiencies as a
standalone entity that does not operate as a subsidiary of a bank.

**The Transactions**

**_Acquisition of TIH_**

On February 20, 2024, TIH entered into the Acquisition Agreement with Truist, the Buyer Entities and the
other parties thereto providing for the acquisition of TIH by an investor group led by affiliates of the Sponsors for a
purchase price that implies an enterprise value for TIH of $15.5 billion, subject to the terms and conditions set forth
therein.

Consummation of the Acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including (i) the receipt of
applicable regulatory approvals and the expiration or termination of applicable waiting periods, (ii) the absence of

Acquisition or any law, code, rule or regulation of any governmental authority of competent jurisdiction preventing
or making illegal the consummation of the Acquisition, (iii) no Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the
Acquisition Agreement) having occurred since the date of the Acquisition Agreement and (iv) other customary
closing conditions.

The Acquisition Agreement contains certain termination rights for each of Truist and the Buyer Entities,
including the right of each party to terminate the Acquisition Agreement if the Acquisition has not been
consummated by August 20, 2024 (subject to automatic extension until November 20, 2024, in the event that on
August 20, 2024 all conditions have been satisfied other than certain regulatory conditions).

Truist and the Buyer Entities have agreed to enter into related agreements ancillary to the Acquisition that
will become effective upon the consummation of the Acquisition, including (i) a customary transition services
agreement, (ii) a relationship marketing agreement pursuant to which Truist and TIH will agree to provide comarketing materials and, as may be needed, business services, to the other party’s clients, (iii) one or more
agreements pursuant to which TIH will continue to serve as Truist Financial Corporation’s (“TFC”) broker of record
for the property and casualty insurance coverage for TFC, and (iv) one or more agreements pursuant to which TIH
will continue to serve as the provider of employee benefits coverages for TFC and its subsidiaries (including an
extension of TFC’s LifeForce premium reduction program and its flexible benefits and COBRA services). In
connection with the Acquisition, (i) any amounts outstanding under TIH’s existing revolving credit facility (the


-----

“Existing Facility”) will be repaid and the commitments thereunder will be terminated and (ii) TIH will undergo an
internal reorganization (the “Internal Reorganization”). See “—Ownership Structure.”

**_Escrow Agreement_**

This offering may be consummated prior to the consummation of the Acquisition. Unless the Acquisition
will be consummated on the closing date of this offering, on the closing date of this offering, the Escrow Issuers will
execute and deliver an escrow agreement with the Trustee and the Escrow Agent (as defined below) (the “Escrow
Agreement”), and will deposit, or cause to be deposited, the gross proceeds from the offering of the notes into the
Escrow Account for the benefit of the holders of the notes pending the consummation of the Acquisition. From the
closing date of this offering to the Completion Date, the Trustee, for its benefit and the benefit of the holders of the
notes, will receive a first priority security interest in the Escrow Account and the Escrowed Property.

The release of the Escrowed Property to the Escrow Issuers (the “Escrow Release”) to consummate the
Acquisition will be subject to the satisfaction of the Escrow Conditions, including the closing of the Acquisition
substantially concurrently with or promptly following the release of such Escrowed Property (the date of the Escrow
Release is hereinafter referred to as the “Completion Date”). The consummation of the Acquisition is subject to
customary closing conditions, including, among other things, the receipt of applicable regulatory approvals and the
expiration or termination of applicable waiting periods. If the Acquisition is not consummated on or prior to the
Escrow Outside Date, or upon the occurrence of certain other events, the Escrowed Property will not be released to
the Escrow Issuers to consummate the Acquisition but instead will be released to the Trustee for the purpose of
redeeming the notes pursuant to a special mandatory redemption in accordance with the procedures set forth in the
indenture governing the notes. The special mandatory redemption price for the notes will be a price equal to 100%

**_Financing Transactions_**

In connection with the consummation of the Acquisition, we intend to enter into the following financing
transactions:

    - the entry into of new senior secured credit facilities (the “Senior Credit Facilities”), which are expected
to consist of (i) a $1,175 million five-year new revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit
Facility”), (ii) a $3,350 million seven-year senior secured first lien term loan facility (the “First Lien
Term Loan Facility” and, together with the Revolving Credit Facility, the “First Lien Credit

    - the contribution of approximately $7,996 million of equity by (i) the Sponsors (the “Sponsor
Contribution”) and (ii) certain existing TIH equityholders who have agreed, or may prior to

company (the “Rollover” and, together with the Sponsor Contribution, the “Equity Contribution”); and

    - the issuance of $2,750 million aggregate principal amount of notes offered hereby.

Upon satisfaction of the Escrow Conditions or if the Acquisition is consummated on the Completion Date,

Escrow of Proceeds; Special

Mandatory Redemption ......................


This offering may be consummated prior to the consummation of the
Acquisition. Unless the Acquisition will be consummated on the
closing date of this offering, on the closing date of this offering, the
Escrow Issuers will execute and deliver the Escrow Agreement and
will deposit, or cause to be deposited, the gross proceeds from the
offering of the notes into the Escrow Account. The Escrow Issuers
will grant to the Trustee, for its benefit and the benefit of the holders
of the notes, a first priority security interest in the Escrow Account
and all amounts on deposit therein (including any earnings reinvested
therein) to secure the obligations under the notes pending
disbursement from the Escrow Account as further described under the
section entitled “Description of the Notes—Escrow of Proceeds;
Special Mandatory Redemption.”

The release of the Escrowed Property to the Escrow Issuers to
consummate the Acquisition will be subject to the satisfaction of the
Escrow Conditions, including the closing of the Acquisition
substantially concurrently with or promptly following the release of
such Escrowed Property. The consummation of the Acquisition is
subject to customary closing conditions, including, among others, the
receipt of applicable regulatory approvals and the expiration or
termination of applicable waiting periods. If the Acquisition is not
consummated on or prior to the Escrow Outside Date, or upon the
occurrence of certain other events, the Escrowed Property will not be
released to the Escrow Issuers to consummate the Acquisition but
instead will be released to the Trustee under the indenture that will
govern the notes for the purpose of redeeming the notes pursuant to a
special mandatory redemption in accordance with the procedures set
forth in the indenture. The special mandatory redemption price will
be a price equal to 100% of the initial issue price of the notes plus
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, from the issue date of the notes to,
but excluding, the special mandatory redemption date. Additional


-----

cash in respect of interest that would accrue on the notes from and
after the issue date of the notes will not be pre-funded into the Escrow
Account on the issue date of the notes, but the Sponsors (directly or
through one or more of their affiliates) will commit on or prior to the
closing date of this offering, in the event of a special mandatory
redemption, to fund the difference between the amounts in the
Escrow Account that are available to be applied to redeem the notes
pursuant to the special mandatory redemption and the special
mandatory redemption price plus the fees and expenses of the Trustee
and the Escrow Agent. See “Description of the Notes—Escrow of
Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”

Guarantees ............................................. Prior to the consummation of the Acquisition, the notes will be the
obligations of the Escrow Issuers and will not be guaranteed and will
not otherwise be the beneficiary of any credit support from TIH,
McGriff Insurance or any of their subsidiaries. Upon consummation
of the Acquisition and following the satisfaction of the Escrow
Conditions (if applicable), the notes will be fully and unconditionally
guaranteed on a senior secured basis, jointly and severally, by
Holdings, ParentCo, ParentCo’s existing wholly-owned domestic
restricted subsidiaries that guarantee the issuers’ obligations under the
Senior Credit Facilities or certain other indebtedness, subject to
certain exceptions (other than Panther Co-Issuer, which will be a
guarantor under the Senior Credit Facilities and a co-issuer of the
notes) and any future wholly-owned domestic subsidiary of Holdings
of which ParentCo is a subsidiary that guarantees the obligations of
the issuers under the Senior Credit Facilities.

Ranking ................................................. Prior to the consummation of the Acquisition and pending the
satisfaction of the Escrow Conditions (if applicable), the notes will be
secured by a first priority security interest in the Escrow Account and
Escrowed Property. From and after the consummation of the
Acquisition and following the satisfaction of the Escrow Conditions
(if applicable), the notes will be the issuers’, and the related
guarantees will be the guarantors’, senior secured obligations and
will:

                   - rank equally in right of payment with all of the issuers’ and the
guarantors’ existing and future senior indebtedness, including
the Senior Credit Facilities;

                   - be effectively senior to all of the issuers’ and the guarantors’
existing and future unsecured indebtedness and junior lien
indebtedness, including the Second Lien Term Loan Facility, to
the extent of the value of the assets securing the notes and the
First Lien Credit Facilities;

                   - rank pari passu with all of the issuers’ and each guarantor’s
existing and future obligations secured on a first lien basis on
the collateral securing the notes, including the First Lien Credit
Facilities;

                   - rank senior in right of payment to all of the issuers’ and each
guarantor’s indebtedness and other obligations that expressly


-----

provide for their subordination to the notes and the related
guarantees; and

                   - be structurally subordinated to all existing and future
indebtedness, claims of holders of preferred stock and other
liabilities of any subsidiary of ParentCo that is not a guarantor
of the notes.

As of December 31, 2023, on an as adjusted basis after giving effect
to the Transactions, the issuers and the guarantors would have had
total funded indebtedness of $8,000 million, $3,350 million of which
would have been secured indebtedness under the First Lien Term
Loan Facility, $1,900 million of which would have been secured
indebtedness under the Second Lien Term Loan Facility and $2,750
million of which would have been secured indebtedness under the
notes offered hereby. In addition, as of December 31, 2023, on an as
adjusted basis after giving effect to the Transactions, we would have
had $1,175 million of availability to incur additional secured
indebtedness under our Revolving Credit Facility (assuming such
facility is undrawn at closing of the Transactions).

As of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, our non-guarantor
subsidiaries represented approximately 3% of our consolidated
revenues, 1% of our consolidated assets, 1% of our consolidated
liabilities and 5% of our consolidated EBITDA.

Security ................................................. Following consummation of the Acquisition, the notes and the
guarantees will be secured on a first lien basis by substantially all
assets of the issuers and the guarantors (other than any Excluded
Assets), which assets will also secure the issuers’ and the guarantors’
obligations under our First Lien Credit Facilities on a first lien basis
and our Second Lien Term Loan Facility on a second lien basis,
subject to permitted liens. See “Description of the Notes—Security.”

Intercreditor Agreements....................... In connection with the issuance of the notes, we will enter into a pari
passu intercreditor agreement (the “Pari Passu Intercreditor
Agreement”) with the collateral agent for the notes (the “Notes
Collateral Agent”) and the collateral agent under our First Lien Credit
Facilities (the “First Lien Credit Facilities Collateral Agent”).

The Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement will set forth the rights of,
and the relationship among, the Notes Collateral Agent, the holders of
the notes, the First Lien Credit Facilities Collateral Agent and the
lenders under the First Lien Credit Facilities in respect of the exercise
of rights and remedies against the issuer and the guarantors. See
“Description of the Notes—Security.”

In addition, we will enter into a junior lien intercreditor agreement
(the “Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement”) with the Notes Collateral
Agent, the First Lien Credit Facilities Collateral Agent and the
collateral agent under our Second Lien Credit Facilities (the “Second
Lien Credit Facilities Collateral Agent”).

The Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement will set forth the rights of,
and the relationship among, the Notes Collateral Agent, the holders of


-----

the notes, the First Lien Credit Facilities Collateral Agent and the
lenders under the First Lien Credit Facilities, on the one hand, and the
Second Lien Credit Facilities Collateral Agent and the lenders under
the Second Lien Term Loan Facility on the other hand in respect of
the exercise of rights and remedies against the issuers and the
guarantors. See “Description of the Notes—Security.”

accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption

an amount not to exceed the net cash proceeds from certain equity

amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest,
if any, to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date.

In addition, at any time prior to      , 2027, the issuers may, at
their option, redeem up to 10% of the aggregate principal amount of
the notes during each twelve-month period beginning on the issue
date at a redemption price equal to 103% of the aggregate principal
amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest,
if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.

See “Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption.”

Change of Control Offer ....................... Upon the occurrence of specific kinds of changes of control, if we do

audit adjustments. Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA is defined as Adjusted EBITDA as further adjusted for new producer
excess compensation, standalone company costs, expense reduction initiatives and the other adjustments set forth in note (2)
below. Free Cash Flow is defined as Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures.

(a) Represents the removal of EBITDA relating to two wholesale businesses within Crump, RiskRighter and Time, which

are non-core and expected to be sold in the first half of 2024.

(b) Gives effect to the results of certain assets acquired between January 1, 2021 and December 31, 2023 as if TIH had

completed the acquisitions of such assets on January 1, 2021.

(c) Prior to the Sponsors’ initial investment in TIH, which closed on April 1, 2023, TIH did not generate interest income

on fiduciary and operating cash balances due to its ownership structure as a subsidiary of Truist Bank. Following such
closing, TIH has received market interest rates on applicable interest-bearing accounts, including fiduciary and
operating cash and certain escrow cash. The adjustment gives effect to the interest TIH would have earned on such
cash accounts assuming it commenced doing so beginning on the first day of the applicable period, assuming thenprevailing market interest rates.

(d) Represents non-cash adjustments primarily comprised of (i) expense from legacy equity incentive plans that have been

sunset and a (ii) long-term incentive plan that will be discontinued following consummation of the Transactions.

(e) Reflects one-time transaction and severance costs associated with prior mergers and acquisitions.

(f) Prior to the Sponsors’ original investment in TIH, which closed on April 1, 2023, TIH issued discretionary forgivable

loans to select employees and new producer hires. The forgivable loan contracts require that the loans be amortized
over a period of 3 to 7 years. Following the closing of the Sponsors’ initial investment, the forgivable loan program
was largely discontinued. The adjustment reflects the amortization associated with the forgivable loans during the
relevant period.

(g) Reflects non-operational income and expense from non-recurring legal settlements, E&O claim payments, and book

sales of termed producers.

(h) Reflects accruals for performance-based contingent earnout obligations.

(i) Primarily includes costs for one-time IT projects and IT integration costs associated with completed M&A

transactions and non-recurring costs associated with separating the TIH business from TFC.

(j) Represents incremental corporate allocations to TIH from TFC. Excess standalone costs are considered in adjustment

(l).

(k) Reflects excess compensation paid to recently onboarded producers relative to what these producers would have

earned based on their commission schedules.

(l) Represents the impact of incremental standalone costs net of actioned cost-savings.

(m) Includes certain buy-side adjustments for 2023 primarily related to run-rate interest income on fiduciary & operating

cash balances, refinement to profit commissions, additional severance and merger expenses, and certain other
adjustments. Such buy-side adjustments have not been made retroactively for 2022 and 2021 and are excluded from
the calculation of Free Cash Flow.

(n) Includes additional run-rate cost savings for 2023 from initiatives expected to be actioned in the next twelve to

eighteen months after the closing of the Transactions, including approximately $20 million in possible savings from
outsourcing or offshoring of non-client facing functions, approximately $3 million of expected additional real estate
rationalization savings and approximately $5 million of potential information technology savings. We may be required


-----

to make significant cash expenditures to achieve such cost savings, and these cash costs are not reflected in Pro Forma
Adjusted EBITDA. We cannot assure you that these cash expenditures to achieve such cost savings will not be higher
than anticipated. In addition, we may not fully realize such cost savings during the time period anticipated, and may
not do so at all. For additional information, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Transactions —We may not
realize any or all of our estimated cost savings, which would have a negative effect on our results of operations.” Such
run-rate cost savings adjustments have not been made retroactively for 2022 and 2021 and are excluded from the
calculation of Free Cash Flow.

(a) Represents the removal of revenue relating to two wholesale businesses within Crump, RiskRighter and Time, which

are non-core and expected to be sold in the first half of 2024.

(b) Primarily relates to the removal of costs associated with stock-based compensation, net impact of pension-related

accounts, non-cash vacation expenses for the one-time carryover of additional vacation days, and out-of-period
incentive expense true ups.

(c) Prior to the Sponsors’ original investment in TIH, which closed on April 1, 2023, TIH issued discretionary

forgivable loans to select employees and new producer hires. Following the closing of the Sponsors’ initial
investment, the forgivable loan program was largely discontinued. The adjustments reflects interest income from the
discretionary forgivable loans during the relevant period.

(d) Reflects non-operational income from non-recurring legal settlements, E&O claim payments, and book sales of

termed producers.

(e) Reflects non-operational allocated income from TFC.

(f) Gives effect to the results of certain assets acquired between January 1, 2021 and December 31, 2023 as if TIH had

completed the acquisitions of such assets on January 1, 2021.

(g) Prior to the Sponsors’ initial investment in TIH, which closed on April 1, 2023, TIH did not generate interest income

on fiduciary and operating cash balances due to its ownership structure as a subsidiary of Truist Bank. Following
such closing, TIH has received market interest rates on applicable interest-bearing accounts, including fiduciary and
operating cash and certain escrow cash. The adjustment gives effect to the interest TIH would have earned on such
fiduciary accounts assuming it commenced doing so beginning on the first day of the applicable period, assuming
then-prevailing market interest rates. This adjustment also includes run-rate interest income at current prevailing
interest rates for the closing operating cash balance of $150 million.

(h) Consists of $1,217 million Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue for Retail, $1,568 million Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue for

Wholesale, $505 million of Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue for Specialty Programs and $92 million of Pro Forma
Adjusted Revenue for Title (with the remaining $74 million of Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue being attributable to
corporate).

(i) Consists of $1,108 million Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue for Retail, $1,433 million Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue for

Wholesale, $515 million of Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue for Specialty Programs and $120 million of Pro Forma

Adjusted Revenue for Title (with the remaining $30 million of Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue being attributable to
corporate).

(j) Consists of $1,051 million Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue for Retail, $1,317 million Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue for

Wholesale, $471 million of Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue for Specialty Programs and $122 million of Pro Forma
Adjusted Revenue for Title (with the remaining $1 million of Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue being attributable to
corporate).

(4) Senior first lien secured debt represents total long-term debt secured by a first priority lien on the collateral on an as adjusted

basis after giving effect to the Transactions. See “Capitalization.”

(5) Represents our total long-term debt on an as adjusted basis after giving effect to the Transactions. See “Capitalization.”

(6) Represents estimated cash and cash equivalents at the closing of the Acquisition.

(7) Reflects estimates for the Senior Credit Facilities and the notes offered hereby using a weighted average blended estimate

rate. Borrowings under the Senior Credit Facilities bear interest at variable rates and are subject to interest rate risk. If
interest rates increase, the debt service obligations on the loans would increase and cash required for servicing indebtedness
would increase. Assuming the Revolving Credit Facility is fully drawn, each 0.125% change in assumed blended interest
rates would result in an approximately $8.0 million change in annual interest expense on indebtedness under the Senior
Credit Facilities.

(8) The as adjusted ratio of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA to cash interest expense is determined by dividing Pro Forma

Adjusted EBITDA by as adjusted cash interest expense.

(9) The as adjusted ratio of senior first lien secured debt to Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA is determined by dividing as adjusted

senior first lien secured debt by Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA.

(10) The as adjusted ratio of net senior first lien secured debt to Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA is determined by dividing as

adjusted senior first lien secured debt, net of cash and cash equivalents, by Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA.

(11) The as adjusted ratio of total debt to Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA is determined by dividing as adjusted total debt by Pro

Forma Adjusted EBITDA.

(12) The as adjusted ratio of net total debt to Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA is determined by dividing as adjusted total debt, net

of cash and cash equivalents, by Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA.

**RISK FACTORS**

_Investing in our notes involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks set forth below_
_as well as other information contained in this offering memorandum. The risks and uncertainties we have described_
_are not the only risks and uncertainties that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or_
_that we currently deem immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and_
_financial condition. In such a case, you may lose all or part of your original investment. The risks discussed below_
_also include forward-looking statements, and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in_
_these forward-looking statements. See “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in this offering_
_memorandum._

**Risks Related to Our Business**

**_Changes in current U.S. or global economic conditions, including an extended slowdown in the markets_**
**_in which we operate, may adversely affect our business._**

If economic conditions were to worsen, a number of negative effects on our business could result, including
declines in insurable exposure units, declines in insurance premium rates, the financial insolvency of insurance
companies, or the reduced ability of customers to pay for our services or amounts owed to us. Also, if general
economic conditions are poor, some of our customers may cease operations completely or be acquired by other
companies, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. If these
customers are affected by poor economic conditions, but yet remain in existence, they may face liquidity problems
or other financial difficulties that could result in delays or defaults in payments owed to us, which could have a
significant adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, decreased
underwriting capacity for insurance and reinsurance may create difficulty for us to place business, which may
adversely impact our ability to earn revenue. Any of these effects could decrease our net revenues and profitability.

**_The occurrence of natural or man-made disasters could result in declines in business and increases in_**
**_claims that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations._**

We are exposed to various risks arising out of natural disasters, including earthquakes, hurricanes, fires,
floods, tornadoes, extreme weather, or other climate events; pandemic health events (such as the COVID-19
pandemic), and man-made disasters, including acts of terrorism, civil unrest, violence, military actions, and cyberterrorism (including, but not limited to, ransomware). The continued threat of terrorism and other events or disasters
may cause significant volatility in global financial markets, and a natural or man-made disaster could trigger energy
shortages, public health issues, or an economic downturn or instability in the areas directly or indirectly affected by
the disaster. These consequences could, among other things, result in a decline in business and increased claims
from those areas. They could also result in reduced underwriting capacity, making it more difficult for our
professionals to place business. Disasters also could disrupt public and private infrastructure, including
communications and financial services, which could disrupt our normal business operations and negatively impact
the abilities of our counterparties to pay for our services on time or at all. If access to underwriting markets for
certain lines of coverage becomes unavailable or difficult due to the impact of climate change on the claims
environment, this may have a negative impact on our clients’ access to coverage, which could in turn reduce our
ability to place certain lines of coverage and negatively impact our business.

A natural or man-made disaster also could disrupt the operations of our counterparties or result in increased
prices for the products and services they provide to us. In addition, a disaster could adversely affect the value of the
assets in our investment portfolio and reduce our insurer capacity. Finally, a natural or man-made disaster could
increase the incidence or severity of E&O claims against us. Climate change may increase the likelihood or severity
of a natural or man-made disaster.


-----

**_Significant or sustained inflation could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial_**
**_condition._**

Inflation can adversely affect us by increasing our costs, including salary costs. Significant inflation is often
accompanied by higher interest rates. Any sustained inflation or significant increases in inflation, such as the wage
inflation experienced during the year ended December 31, 2023, and interest rates could have an adverse effect on
our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_The insurance intermediary business is highly competitive._** **_Our current market share may decrease as a_**
**_result of disintermediation within the insurance industry, including increased competition from insurance_**
**_companies, technology companies and the financial services industry, as well as the shift away from traditional_**
**_insurance markets._**

The insurance intermediary business is highly competitive and we actively compete with numerous brokerage
firms for customers, some of which may have greater resources than we do. We believe that our most likely source of
competition will be other brokerages that pursue an acquisition or consolidation strategy similar to ours, as well as
other large regional brokerages. Over the last several decades, large insurance brokerages, often publicly-traded
companies with access to the capital markets, have been acquiring and consolidating small- to medium-sized
independent brokerages to strengthen their competitive position and to increase market share and recently, due to
increased consolidation in our industry, the value of acquisition targets has increased. Other competitive concerns may
include the availability of products and services, the market price and the ability of some of our customers to self-insure
and the entrance of technology companies into the insurance intermediary business.

This exposes us to a risk of being less competitive when trying to acquiring companies and increases the risk
that we may overpay for future acquisitions. If we fail to execute our acquisition strategy, our revenue growth and
ability to remain competitive in our industry are likely to suffer. In circumstances where we are able to make
acquisitions, we may need to incur contingent earn-out obligations for these acquisitions.

In addition, there has been an increase in alternative insurance markets, such as captives, risk retention groups
and non-insurance capital markets. While we collaborate and compete in some of these segments, we cannot be certain
that such alternative markets will provide the same level of insurance coverage or profitability as traditional insurance
markets.

**_Quarterly and annual variations in our commissions that result from the timing of policy renewals and_**
**_the net effect of new and lost business production may have unexpected effects on our results of operations._**

Our commission income (including profit-sharing contingent commissions and override commissions) can
vary quarterly or annually due to the timing of policy renewals and the net effect of new and lost business
production. We do not control the factors that cause these variations. Specifically, customers’ demand for insurance
products can influence the timing of renewals, new business and lost business (which includes policies that are not
renewed), and cancellations. In addition, we rely on insurance companies for the payment of contingent
commissions. Because these payments are processed internally by these insurance companies, we may not receive a
payment that is otherwise expected from a particular insurance company in a particular quarter or year until after the
end of that period, which can adversely affect our ability to forecast these revenues and therefore budget for
significant future expenditures. Quarterly and annual fluctuations in revenues based on increases and decreases
associated with the timing of policy renewals may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and
cash flows.

**_Our commissions depend on premium rates charged by insurance carriers, which we do not control and_**
**_which historically have varied and are difficult to predict. Any declines in premiums may adversely impact our_**
**_operating results._**

We are engaged in insurance agency and brokerage activities and derive revenue principally from
commissions paid by insurance carriers. Commissions accounted for approximately 79% of our total revenue during
the year ended December 31, 2023. Commissions are generally paid on the basis of a percentage of premiums paid


-----

by customers for insurance products. We have no control over the insurance premium rates on which these
commissions are calculated. The amount of such commissions is therefore highly dependent on the premium rates
charged by insurance carriers. Premium rates may vary widely and are determined by insurance carriers based on
specific market conditions, applicable law and, in certain states, regulatory approval.

Insurance premium pricing within the traditional property and casualty insurance industry has historically
been cyclical, based on the relative underwriting capacity of the insurance industry and economic conditions. We
use the terms “soft market” and “hard market” to describe the business cycles experienced by the industry. A soft
market is an insurance market characterized by a period of declining premium rates, which can negatively affect
commissions earned by insurance brokers. A hard market is an insurance market characterized by a period of rising
premium rates, which, absent other changes, can positively affect commissions earned by insurance brokers.
External events, such as terrorist attacks and natural disasters, can also have significant impacts on the insurance
market.

Because we cannot determine the timing and extent of premium pricing changes, we cannot accurately
forecast our commission income, including whether it will significantly decline. If premiums decline or commission
rates are reduced, our revenue, results of operations and cash flow could be materially and adversely affected.

In addition, an increase in the number of insolvencies associated with an economic downturn, especially
insolvencies in the insurance industry, could adversely affect our brokerage business through the loss of clients or by
hampering our ability to place insurance business.

There have also been and may continue to be various trends in the insurance industry toward alternative
insurance markets including, among other things, greater levels of self-insurance, captive insurance (i.e.,
arrangements where the policyholder owns the insurance company), rent-a-captive or segregated cell arrangements,
risk retention groups and non-insurance capital markets-based solutions to traditional insurance. While we may be
able to participate in certain of these activities on behalf of our customers and obtain fee revenue for such services,
there can be no assurance that we will realize revenues and profitability as favorable as those realized from our
traditional brokerage activities.

**_Contingent and supplemental revenues we receive from insurance or reinsurance carriers are less_**
**_predictable than standard commission revenues, and any decrease in the amount of these forms of revenue could_**
**_adversely affect our results of operations._**

A meaningful portion of our revenues consists of contingent and supplemental revenues from insurance or
reinsurance carriers. Contingent revenues are paid after the insurance contract period, generally in the first or second
quarter, based on the growth and/or profitability of business we placed with insurance or reinsurance carriers during
the prior year. On the other hand, supplemental revenues are paid up front, on an annual or quarterly basis, generally
based on our historical premium volumes with insurance or reinsurance carriers and additional capabilities or
services we bring to the engagement. While insurance or reinsurance carriers generally maintain supplemental
revenues in the current year at a pre-determined rate, that rate can change in future years as described above. In
addition there are revenues subject to sliding scale commissions based on overall underwriting performance. This is
evaluated quarterly based on third-party actuarial analysis. If, due to the current economic environment or for any
other reason, we are unable to meet insurance or reinsurance carriers’ particular profitability, volume or growth
thresholds, as the case may be, or such companies increase their estimate of loss reserves (over which we have no
control), actual contingent revenues or supplemental revenues could be less than anticipated, which could adversely
affect our results of operations. In the case of contingent revenues, under revenue recognition accounting standards,
this could lead to the reversal of revenues in future periods that were recognized in prior periods.

**_Our business, and therefore our results of operations and financial condition, may be adversely affected_**
**_by conditions that result in reduced insurer capacity._**

Our results of operations depend on the continued capacity of insurance carriers to adequately and
appropriately underwrite risk and provide coverage, which partly depends in turn on those insurance companies’
ability to procure reinsurance. Capacity could also be reduced by insurance companies failing or withdrawing from
writing certain coverages that we offer to our clients. We have no control over these matters. To the extent that


-----

reinsurance becomes less widely available or significantly more expensive, we may not be able to procure the
amount or types of coverage that our clients desire and the coverage we are able to procure for our clients may be
too expensive or more limited than is acceptable.

**_We have experienced strong organic growth in recent periods, and our recent growth rates may not be_**
**_indicative of our future growth. We may be unsuccessful in growing revenues organically, and our failure to do_**
**_so may negatively impact our financial position, results of operations and cash flows._**

We have experienced significant organic revenue growth in recent periods. As a means to grow our
earnings in future periods, we intend to focus on generating organic growth in revenues and creating efficiencies in
our operations. Our business plan contemplates that we will grow revenue organically over the long term through all
insurance industry cycles and economic market cycles, primarily by continuing our specialty focus and team-based
selling approach and by pursuing alternative distribution strategies with co-brokers. We may not be able to sustain
organic revenue growth consistent with recent history, or at all. If we fail to succeed in our organic growth strategy,
our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively affected. We believe our revenue
growth depends on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, our ability to:

      - deliver on customer expectations and provide a positive customer experience;

      - successfully execute large-scale, critical programs and projects in a timely and cost-effective
manner;

      - identify and successfully enter and market our services in new geographic markets and market
segments;

      - recruit and retain qualified personnel;

      - coordinate efforts across various geographic markets and market segments;

      - maintain and grow relationships with our existing customers and expand our customer base;

      - offer new products and services;

      - form strategic alliances and partnerships;

      - secure key partner and vendor relationships; and

      - access sufficient capital.

We may not successfully accomplish any of these objectives and ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical
uncertainty may impact our ability to successfully accomplish any of the above. As a result, it is difficult for us to
forecast our future results of operations. Our historical growth rate should not be considered indicative of our future
performance and may decline in the future. In future periods, our revenue could grow more slowly than in recent
periods or decline for any number of reasons (including those outlined above), which could negatively affect our
financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

**_Our growth strategy may involve opening new offices, entering new product lines or establishing new_**
**_distribution channels, and will involve hiring new producers, brokers and underwriters, which will require_**
**_substantial investment by us and, the costs associated with such investment, or the failure to recover or realize the_**
**_benefits of such investment, may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows in a particular period._**

Our ability to grow organically depends in part on our ability to open new offices, enter new product lines,
establish new distribution channels and recruit new producers, brokers and underwriters. We can provide no
assurances that we will be successful in any efforts to open new offices, develop de novo product lines, establish
new distribution channels or hire new producers, brokers or underwriters. The costs of opening a new office,


-----

entering a new product line, establishing a new distribution channel and hiring the necessary personnel to staff the
office can be substantial, and we often are required to commit to multi-year, non-cancellable lease agreements. The
cost of investing in new offices, producers, brokers and underwriters may affect our results of operations and cash
flows in a particular period. Moreover, we cannot assure you that these efforts will be successful, that the
marketplace will accept our products or services, that we will be able to retain clients that adopt our new products or
services, that we will be able to recover our investment in new offices, producers, brokers or underwriters or that
these offices, producers, brokers and underwriters will achieve profitability. Our inability to realize the benefits of
these investments may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows and may result in reputational
damage.

**_Our business and growth strategy includes plans to continue to make acquisitions and we face risks_**
**_associated with the evaluation of potential acquisitions, the integration of acquired businesses, and the_**
**_introduction of new products, lines of business, and markets._**

As part of our business and growth strategy, we have made, and intend to continue to make, acquisitions,
including acquisitions in lines of business that are natural adjacencies. The success of our acquisition strategy is
dependent upon our ability to identify appropriate acquisition targets, negotiate transactions on favorable terms,
complete transactions, have adequate access to financing and the ability to finance acquisitions on acceptable terms,
and successfully integrate them into our existing businesses.

We may not be successful in identifying appropriate acquisition and disposition candidates or
consummating acquisitions on terms acceptable or favorable to us. We also face additional risks related to
acquisitions, including the ability to negotiate transactions on favorable terms, the ability to secure regulatory
approval of transactions where required, the ability to successfully integrate them into our existing businesses and
culture, and the potential that any acquired business could significantly underperform relative to our expectations. If
we are unable to identify and successfully make, integrate and manage acquisitions, our business could be materially
adversely affected. Additionally, if we were to expand to or acquire businesses outside of the United States, we may
be subject to additional risks related to foreign operations, which may adversely affect our results of operations and
financial condition.

If acquisitions are made, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions, including, but not
limited to, revenue growth, operational efficiencies, or expected synergies. Acquisitions involve special risks,
including the potential assumption of unanticipated liabilities and contingencies and difficulties in integrating
acquired businesses, and acquired businesses may not achieve the levels of revenue, profit, or productivity we
anticipate or otherwise perform as we expect. In addition, if the operating performance of an acquired business
deteriorates significantly, we may need to write down the value of the goodwill and other acquisition-related
intangible assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. Many of the businesses and assets that we have
acquired or may acquire have unaudited historical financial statements or records that have been, or will be,
prepared by the management of such companies and have not been, or will not be, independently reviewed or
audited. We cannot be certain that the financial statements or records of companies or assets we have acquired or
may acquire would not, or will not, be materially different if such statements were independently reviewed or
audited. If such statements were to be materially different, the tangible and intangible assets we acquire may be
more susceptible to impairment charges, which could have a material adverse effect on us.

In addition, many of the businesses that we acquire and develop will likely have smaller scales of
operations prior to the implementation of our growth strategy. If we are not able to manage the growing complexity
of these businesses, including improving, refining, or revising our systems and operational practices, enlarging the
scale and scope of the businesses, and integrating the new business into our culture and operations, our business may
be adversely affected. The process of integrating an acquired business may subject us to a number of risks,
including, without limitation, an inability to retain the management, key personnel and other colleagues of the
acquired business; an inability to establish uniform standards, controls, systems, procedures and policies or to
achieve anticipated savings; and exposure to legal claims or regulatory censure for activities of the acquired business
prior to acquisition.

With respect to any such acquisition transactions, we face the risk related to the potential impacts of the
transaction and integration on relationships, including with colleagues, correspondents, suppliers, clients and


-----

competitors, as well as the risk related to contingent liabilities (including litigation) potentially creating material
liabilities for the Company. The following risks, in addition to those described above, may also adversely affect our
ability to successfully implement and integrate these acquisitions: material changes in U.S. jurisdiction regulation
(including those related to the healthcare system and Medicare and insurance brokerage, pension advisory, and
investment services); changes in general economic, business and political conditions in relevant markets, including
changes in the financial markets; significant competition in the marketplace; and compliance with extensive and
evolving government regulations in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions.

If acquisitions or entry into businesses, products or services are not successfully integrated and the intended
benefits of the acquisitions or business developments are not achieved, our business, financial condition and results
of operations could be materially adversely affected, as well as our professional reputation.

From time to time, either through acquisitions or internal development, we enter new distribution channels
or lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business. These new distribution
channels, lines of business, or new products and services present additional risks, particularly in instances where the
markets are not fully developed. Such risks include the investment of significant time and resources to recruit, hire,
and retain personnel and develop the products, the risks involved with the management of the integration process
and development of new processes and systems to accommodate complex programs, and the risk of financial
guarantees and additional liabilities associated with these efforts.

Failure to manage these risks arising from acquisitions or development of new businesses could materially
and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

**_Our business may be harmed if we lose our relationships with retailers, insurance carriers or our other_**
**_clients and trading partners, we fail to maintain good relationships with retailers, insurance carriers or our other_**
**_clients or trading partners, we become dependent upon a limited number of retailers, insurance carriers or other_**
**_clients or trading partners or we fail to develop new retailer, insurance carrier and client or trading partner_**
**_relationships._**

Our business typically enters into contractual relationships with insurance carriers, retailers and other
clients or trading partners that are sometimes unique to us, but nonexclusive and terminable on short notice by either
party for any reason. In many cases, insurance carriers also have the ability to amend the terms of our agreements
unilaterally on short notice.

Insurance carriers may be unwilling to allow us to sell their existing or new insurance products or may
amend our agreements with them, for a variety of reasons, including for competitive or regulatory reasons or
because of a reluctance to distribute their products through our platform. Insurance carriers may decide to rely on
their own internal distribution channels, choose to exclude us from their most profitable or popular products, or
decide not to distribute insurance products in individual markets in certain geographies or altogether. The
termination or amendment of our relationship with an insurance carrier could reduce the variety of insurance
products we offer or our ability to place coverage for certain risks for which we do not have alternative markets. We
also could lose a source of, or be paid reduced commissions for, future sales and could lose renewal commissions for
past sales. Our business could also be harmed if we fail to develop new insurance carrier relationships.

Similarly, as it relates to wholesale brokerage, retail agencies and other trading partners could develop their
own wholesale distribution channels or choose to work with wholesale distributors other than us. This could reduce
the number of submissions we receive which could result in reduced commissions. Historically, wholesale brokers
and other wholesale distributors have been involved in a very high percentage of risks placed in the excess and
surplus market. In addition to the potential for retailers developing their own wholesale distribution channels or
choosing to work with wholesale distributors other than us, retail brokers often might prefer to place business
directly with insurance carriers, without the involvement of a wholesaler. There is a risk to our business that
insurance carriers will accommodate the retail broker’s preference to place business directly with the excess and
surplus insurer as opposed to through a wholesale broker or other wholesale distributor.

In the future, we may have a reduced number of insurance carriers or retail agencies, in the case of
wholesale brokerage, with which we trade or derive a greater portion of our commissions and fees from a more


-----

concentrated number of insurance carriers, retailers or other trading partners as our business and the insurance
industry evolve. Should our dependence on a smaller number of insurance retailers or other trading partners
increase, whether as a result of the termination of relationships, consolidation or otherwise, we may become more
vulnerable to adverse changes in our relationships with these counterparties, particularly in states where we offer
insurance products from a relatively small number of insurance carriers or where a small number of insurance
companies or retailers dominate a geographic area, lines of business or market segment. The termination or
consolidation of insurance retailers could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We depend, to a large extent, on our relationships with all of our trading partners and our reputation for
high-quality advice and solutions. If a trading partner is not satisfied with our services, it could cause us to incur
additional costs and impair profitability. Many of our clients are businesses that band together in industry groups or
trade associations and actively share information among themselves about the quality of service they receive from
their vendors. Accordingly, poor service to one client may negatively impact our relationships with multiple other
clients or potential clients. Moreover, if we fail to meet our contractual obligations, we could be subject to legal
liability or loss of client relationships.

**_If any of our MGA programs are terminated or changed, our business and operating results could be_**
**_harmed._**

Some of our subsidiaries and programs act as an MGA for insurance carriers that have given them authority
to underwrite and bind coverage on their behalf. Additionally, several of our subsidiaries hold MGA licenses. We
generated 25% of our consolidated total net commissions and fees for the year ended December 31, 2023 from our
MGA programs. Our MGA programs are governed by contracts between us and the insurance carriers. These
contracts establish, among other things, the underwriting and pricing guidelines for the program, the scope of our
authority and our commission rates for policies that we underwrite under the program. These contracts typically can
be terminated by the insurance carrier with very little advance notice. Moreover, upon expiration of the contract
term, insurance carriers may request changes in the terms of the program, including the amount of commissions we
receive, which could reduce our revenues from the program. The termination of any of our MGA programs, or a
change in the terms of any of these programs, could harm our business and operating results. We cannot be assured
that lost insurance capacity can be replaced or that other MGA programs will not be terminated or modified in the
future. Moreover, we cannot be assured that we will be able to replace any of our MGA programs that are
terminated with a similar program with other insurance carriers.

**_We rely on third parties to perform key functions of our business operations and to provide services to_**
**_our clients. These third parties may act in ways that could harm our business._**

We rely on third parties, and in some cases subcontractors, to operate our business efficiently and
profitably, to provide products and services that meet the expectations of our clients, to maintain an effective risk
management framework, data and information such as technology, information security, fund transfer, data
processing, and administration and support functions that are critical to the operations of our business. These third
parties include correspondents, agents and other brokerage and intermediaries, insurance markets, data providers,
plan trustees, payroll service providers, software and system vendors, health plan providers, and providers of human
resource functions such as recruiters and trainers, among others. As we do not fully control the actions of these third
parties, we are subject to the risk that their decisions may adversely impact us and replacing these service providers
could create significant delay and expense. A failure by the third parties to comply with service level agreement or
regulatory or legal requirements, in a high quality and timely manner, particularly during periods of our peak
demand for their services, could result in economic and reputational harm to us. In addition, these third parties face
their own technology, operating, business and economic risks, and any significant failures by them, including the
improper use or disclosure of our confidential client, employee, or company information, could cause harm to our
reputation. An interruption in or the cessation of service by any service provider as a result of systems failures,
capacity constraints, financial difficulties or for any other reason could disrupt our operations, impact our ability to
offer certain products and services, and result in contractual or regulatory penalties, liability claims from clients
and/or employees, damage to our reputation and harm to our business.


-----

**_Economic conditions that result in financial difficulties for insurance or reinsurance carriers or lead to_**
**_reduced risk-taking capital capacity could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition._**

We have a significant amount of receivables from certain of the insurance or reinsurance carriers with
which we place insurance. If those companies experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties, we could
encounter delays or defaults in payments owed to us, which could have a significant adverse impact on our
consolidated financial condition and results of operations. The failure of an insurance or reinsurance carriers with
which we place business could result in E&O claims against us by our clients. Further, the failure of E&O insurance
or reinsurance carriers could make the E&O insurance we rely upon cost prohibitive or unavailable. Any of these
developments could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if insurance or
reinsurance carriers merge, fail, or withdraw from offering certain lines of coverage, for example, because of large
payouts related to climate or weather events or other emerging risk areas, overall risk-taking capital capacity could
be negatively affected, which could reduce our ability to place certain lines of coverage, and, as a result, reduce our
revenues and profitability.

**_If we are unable to collect our receivables, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely_**
**_affected._**

Our business depends on our ability to successfully obtain payment from our clients of the amounts they
owe us for our work performed. In most cases, we bill and collect on relatively short cycles. There is no guarantee
that we will accurately assess the creditworthiness of our clients. Macroeconomic conditions, including those
experienced as a result of COVID-19, inflation and rising interest rates, could result in financial difficulties for our
clients, which could cause clients to delay payments to us, request modifications to their payment arrangements that
could increase our receivables balance, or default on their payment obligations to us. While we have not experienced
material difficulties with the collection of our outstanding receivables to date, others in our industry have
experienced collection issues from time to time, and we could experience similar collection problems in the future.
Timely collection of client balances also depends on our ability to complete our contractual commitments and bill
and collect our contracted revenues. If we are unable to meet our contractual requirements, we might experience
delays in collection of, or be unable to collect, our client balances, and if this occurs, our results of operations and
cash flows could be adversely affected. In addition, if we experience an increase in the time it takes to bill and
collect for our services, our cash flows could be adversely affected.

**_Our business depends on strong brands, and any failure to maintain, protect and enhance our brand_**
**_would hurt our ability to grow our business, particularly in new markets where we have limited brand_**
**_recognition._**

We have developed strong brands that we believe have contributed significantly to the success of our
business. Maintaining, protecting and enhancing our brands is critical to growing our business, particularly in new
markets where we have limited brand recognition. If we do not successfully build and maintain strong brands, our
business could be materially harmed. Maintaining and enhancing the quality of our brands may require us to make
substantial investments in areas such as marketing, community relations, outreach and employee training. We
actively engage in advertisements, targeted promotional mailings and email communications, and engage on a
regular basis in public relations and sponsorship activities. These investments may be substantial and may fail to
encompass the optimal range of traditional, online and social advertising media to achieve maximum exposure and
benefit to the brands.

**_If our underwriting models contain errors or are otherwise ineffective or our underwriters do not_**
**_demonstrate sufficient skill, our reputation and relationships with insurance carriers, retail brokers and agents_**
**_could be harmed._**

Our ability to attract insurance carriers, retail brokers and agents to our programs and binding authority
operations is significantly dependent on our ability to effectively evaluate risks in accordance with insurer
underwriting policies. Our business depends significantly on the accuracy and success of our underwriting model
and the skill of our underwriters. To conduct this evaluation, we use proprietary underwriting models and third-party
tools. If our underwriters do not perform with the expected level of skill or any of the models or tools that we use
contain programming or other errors, are ineffective or the data provided by clients or third parties is incorrect or


-----

stale, or if we are unable to obtain accurate data from clients or third parties, our pricing and approval process could
be negatively affected, resulting in potential violations of underwriting authority and loss of business. This could
damage our reputation and relationships with insurance carriers, retail brokers and agents, which could harm our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_If our clients or third parties are not satisfied with our services, we may face additional cost, loss of_**
**_profit opportunities and damage to our reputation or legal liability._**

We depend, to a large extent, on our relationships with our clients and our reputation for high-quality
brokering and risk management solutions, so that we can understand our clients’ needs and deliver solutions and
services that are tailored to satisfy these needs. If a client is not satisfied with our services, it may be more damaging
to our business than to other businesses and could cause us to incur additional costs and impair profitability. Many
of our clients are businesses that band together in industry groups and/or trade associations and actively share
information among themselves about the quality of service they receive from their vendors. Accordingly, poor
service to one client may negatively impact our relationships with multiple other clients. Moreover, if we fail to
meet our contractual obligations, we could be subject to legal liability or loss of client relationships.

The nature of much of our work, involves assumptions and estimates concerning future events, the actual
outcome of which we cannot know with certainty in advance. Similarly, in our consulting business, we may be
measured based on our track record regarding judgments and advice that are susceptible to influences unknown at
the time the advice was given. In addition, we could make computational, software programming or data entry or
management errors. A client may nonetheless claim it suffered losses due to reliance on our consulting advice. And,
in addition to the risks of liability exposure and increased costs of defense and insurance premiums, claims arising
from our professional services may produce publicity that could hurt our reputation and business and adversely
affect our ability to secure new business.

**_We are subject to economic and reputational harm if companies with which we do business engage in_**
**_negligent, grossly negligent, misleading or fraudulent behavior and damage to our reputation could have a_**
**_material adverse effect on our business._**

As part of our role in distributing insurance products and services, we rely upon trusted trading partners to
provide risk-bearing insurance capital, collect and transmit funds, and to provide other products and services. If one
or more of these trading partners, whether negligently or intentionally, fails to provide the risk-bearing insurance,
capital as agreed, mishandles or misappropriates funds, or otherwise fails to properly provide products and services
as expected, we face potential liability for damages and reputational harm.

Our ability to attract and retain clients, employees, investors, capital and insurer trading partners is highly
dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of service, trustworthiness, business practices, financial
condition and other subjective qualities. Negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters could erode trust
and confidence and damage our reputation among existing and potential clients which in turn could make it difficult
for us to maintain existing clients and attract new ones. Damage to our reputation due to a failure to proactively
communicate to stakeholders on changes in strategy and business plans could further affect the confidence of our
clients, regulators, creditors, investors, insurer trading partners and other parties that are important to our business,
having a material adverse effect on our business, ability to raise capital, financial condition, and results of
operations.

**_Our inability to hire, retain and develop qualified employees, as well as the loss of any of our senior_**
**_management or other key employees, could negatively impact our ability to retain existing business and generate_**
**_new business._**

Our success depends on our ability to attract, retain and develop skilled and experienced personnel. There
is significant competition from within the insurance industry and from businesses outside the industry for
exceptional employees, especially in key positions. If we are not able to successfully attract, retain, develop and
motivate our employees, our business, financial results and reputation could be materially and adversely affected.


-----

Our success and future performance depends in part upon the continued services of our senior management,
and other highly skilled personnel. Losing employees who manage or support substantial customer relationships or
possess substantial experience or expertise could adversely affect our ability to secure and complete customer
engagements, which would adversely affect our results of operations. This risk may be increased by remote or
hybrid working arrangements, which may make our employees more vulnerable to solicitations by competing firms.
Also, if any of our key employees were to join an existing competitor or form a competing company, some of our
customers could choose to use the services of that competitor instead of our services. While our key employees are
generally prohibited by contract from soliciting our employees and customers for a two-year period following
separation from employment with us, they are not prohibited from competing with us. Similarly, if an employee
joins us from a competitor and is subject to enforceable restrictive covenants, we may be delayed in optimizing the
employee’s potential. In addition, regulation or legislation impacting the workforce or the ability to enforce
employment-related restrictive covenants (due to state or federal laws or regulations), may lead to increased
uncertainty and competition for talent.

In addition, we could be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for the succession of our senior
management. The loss of our senior management or other key employees, or our inability to continue to identify,
recruit and retain such personnel, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

**Technology Risks**

**_We depend on our information processing systems. Interruption or loss of our information processing_**
**_systems could have a material adverse effect on our business._**

Our ability to provide administrative services depends on our capacity to store, retrieve, process and
manage significant databases and expand and upgrade periodically our information processing capabilities.
Interruption or loss of our information processing capabilities through loss of stored data, breakdown or
malfunctioning of computer equipment and software systems, telecommunications failure, or damage caused by fire,
tornadoes, lightning, electrical power outage or other disruption could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations. Although we have certain disaster recovery procedures in
place and insurance to protect against such contingencies, such procedures may not be effective and any insurance
or recovery procedures may not continue to be available at reasonable prices and may not address all such losses or
compensate us for the possible loss of clients occurring during any period that we are unable to provide services.
Significant costs are involved with maintaining safeguards for our information processing systems. If we are unable
to efficiently and effectively maintain and upgrade these safeguards, including in connection with the integration of
acquisitions, we could incur unexpected costs and certain of our systems could become more vulnerable, which
could have a material adverse effect on our business.

**_Security breaches and improper use of information may negatively impact our business and harm our_**
**_reputation._**

We maintain confidential, personal and proprietary information relating to our Company, our employees,
our clients and their employees and other third parties. This information includes personally identifiable
information, protected health information and financial information. A security breach in our facilities, computer
networks or databases could expose us to a risk of loss of, or unauthorized access to and use of, this information,
which could harm our business and reputation and result in a loss of customers or the imposition of fines or other
penalties by governmental agencies and claims by our customers and their applicants and employees.

Despite security measures we maintain, our systems may be vulnerable to physical break-ins, computer
viruses, attacks by hackers, employee malfeasance and similar intrusions, and our third-party contractors who handle
information also may experience security breaches involving the storage and transmission of proprietary and
sensitive personal information. The age of some of our technology, as well as the expansion of and increased use of
mobile devices, online and “cloud”-based services and social media tools by employees, clients and third parties,
and the speed at which information can be widely distributed, all contribute to an increased risk of intentional or
unintentional distribution or misuse of such information.


-----

If unauthorized parties gain access to our services, networks or databases, they may be able to steal,
publish, delete or modify our confidential and sensitive third-party personal information. Any inability to protect the
security and privacy of our data and electronic transactions could cause harm to our business and reputation and
result in significant liability. We engage in periodic testing and maintain policies, procedures and technical
safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of confidential, personal and proprietary information.
However, our testing efforts may not discover all system deficiencies, and we may not be able to fully remediate any
discovered deficiencies in a timely manner. Techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems
change frequently and generally are not discovered until they have been launched against a target. As a result, we
may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.

**_A cybersecurity attack, or any other interruption in information technology and/or data security that_**
**_may impact our operations or the operations of third parties that support us, could adversely affect our business,_**
**_financial condition and reputation._**

We rely on information technology and third-party vendors to provide effective and efficient service to our
customers, process claims, and timely and accurately report information to carriers and which often involves secure
processing of confidential sensitive, proprietary and other types of information. Cybersecurity breaches of any of the
systems we rely on may result from circumvention of security systems, denial-of-service attacks or other cyberattacks, hacking, “phishing” attacks, computer viruses, ransomware, malware, employee or insider error,
malfeasance, social engineering, physical breaches or other actions, any of which could expose us to data loss,
monetary and reputational damages and significant increases in compliance costs. The risk of such cybersecurity
breaches may be increased by our increased reliance on work-from-home or other remote work technologies. An
interruption of our access to, or an inability to access, our information technology, telecommunications or other
systems could significantly impair our ability to perform such functions on a timely basis. If sustained or repeated,
such a business interruption, system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and
process new and renewal business, provide customer service, pay claims in a timely manner or perform other
necessary business functions. We have from time to time experienced cybersecurity incidents, such as malware
infections, phishing campaigns and vulnerability exploit attempts.

Additionally, we are an acquisitive organization and the process of integrating the information systems of
the businesses we acquire is complex and exposes us to additional risk as we might not adequately identify
weaknesses in the targets’ information systems, which could expose us to unexpected liabilities or make our own
systems more vulnerable to attack. In the future, any material breaches of cybersecurity, or media reports of the
same, even if untrue, could cause us to experience reputational harm, loss of customers and revenue, loss of
proprietary data, regulatory actions and scrutiny, sanctions or other statutory penalties, litigation, liability for failure
to safeguard customers’ information or financial losses. Such losses may not be insured against or not fully covered
through insurance we maintain.

We cannot entirely eliminate all risk of improper access to private information, and the cost and operational
consequences of implementing, maintaining and enhancing further system protections measures could increase
significantly as cybersecurity threats increase. As these threats evolve, cybersecurity incidents will be more difficult
to detect, defend against and remediate. Any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and reputation.

**_Our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity or data_**
**_recovery problem could cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational_**
**_harm or legal liability._**

If we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity event, such as an earthquake,
hurricane, flood, terrorist attack, pandemic, war or other geopolitical tensions, protests or riots, security breach,
cyberattack (including manipulating the control systems of critical infrastructure), power loss or telecommunications
failure, our ability to operate will depend, in part, on the continued availability of our personnel, our office facilities
and the proper functioning of our computer, telecommunication and other related systems and operations. In such an
event, we could experience operational challenges that could have a material adverse effect on our business. The risk
of business disruption is more pronounced in certain geographic areas, including major metropolitan centers, where


-----

we have significant operations and colleagues, and in certain countries and regions in which we operate that are
subject to higher potential threat of terrorist attacks or military conflicts.

Our operations depend in particular upon our ability to protect our technology infrastructure against
damage. If a business continuity event occurs, we could lose client or Company data or experience interruptions to
our operations or delivery of services to our clients, which could have a material adverse effect. Such risks have
increased significantly due to hybrid and remote work environments. A cyberattack or other business continuity
event affecting us or a key vendor or other third party could result in a significant and extended disruption in the
functioning of our information technology systems or operations or our ability to recover data, requiring us to incur
significant expense to address and remediate or otherwise resolve such issues. For example, hackers have
increasingly targeted companies by attacking internet-connected industrial control and safety control systems. An
extended outage could result in the loss of clients and a decline in our revenues. In the worst case, any manipulation
of the control systems of critical infrastructure may even result in the loss of life.

We regularly assess and take steps to improve our existing business continuity, disaster recovery and data
recovery plans and key management succession. However, a disaster or other continuity event on a significant scale
or affecting certain of our key operating areas within or across regions, or our inability to successfully recover from
such an event, could materially interrupt our business operations and result in material financial loss, loss of human
capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm, damaged client relationships and legal liability. Our business
disruption insurance may also not fully cover, in type or amount, the cost of a successful recovery in the event of
such a disruption.

**_We will continually encounter technological change and must effectively anticipate, develop and_**
**_implement new technology._**

The insurance services industry is undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of
new technology-driven products and services. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to develop and
implement technology solutions that anticipate and keep pace with rapid and continuing changes in technology,
industry standards, client preferences and internal control standards. We have invested in technology to automate
functions previously performed manually and otherwise to enhance the client experience with respect to the
Company’s products and services. We expect to make additional investments in innovation and technology to
address technological disruption in the industry and improve client offerings and service. These changes allow the
Company to better serve the Company’s clients and to reduce costs.

The Company’s continued success depends, in part, upon the Company’s ability to address clients’ needs
by using technology to provide products and services that satisfy client demands. A failure to maintain or enhance
the Company’s competitive position with respect to technology, whether because of a failure to anticipate client
expectations, a failure in the performance of technological developments or an untimely roll out of developments,
may cause the Company to lose market share or incur additional expense. If we cannot offer new technologies as
quickly as our competitors, or if our competitors develop more cost-effective technologies, we could experience a
material adverse effect on our client relationships, growth strategy, compliance programs and operating results.

**_We face substantial legal and operational risks in safeguarding personal information._**

Our businesses are subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations governing the privacy and
protection of personal information of individuals. We maintain confidential, personal and proprietary information
relating to our Company, our employees, our clients, including prospective clients, job applicants and third parties.
This information includes personally identifiable information, protected health information, and financial
information. We are subject to data privacy laws and regulations relating to the collection, use, retention, security
and transfer of this information. Complying with the laws, rules and regulations applicable to the Company’s
disclosure, collection, use, sharing and storage of personal information can increase operating costs, impact the
development of new products or services, and reduce operational efficiency. Any mishandling or misuse of personal
information by the Company or a third-party affiliated with the Company could expose the Company to litigation or
regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions.


-----

Additional risks could arise from the failure of the Company or third parties to provide adequate disclosure
or transparency to the Company’s clients about the personal information collected from them and the use of such
information; to receive, document, and honor the privacy preferences expressed by the Company’s clients; to protect
personal information from unauthorized disclosure; or to maintain proper training on privacy practices for all
teammates or third parties who have access to personal information. Concerns regarding the effectiveness of our
measures to safeguard personal information, or even the perception that those measures are inadequate, could cause
the Company to lose existing or potential clients, and thereby reduce our revenues. Furthermore, any failure or
perceived failure by the Company to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws, rules and regulations
may subject it to inquiries, examinations and investigations that could result in requirements to modify or cease
certain operations or practices, significant liabilities or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions. Any of these
could damage our reputation and otherwise adversely affect its businesses.

In recent years, well-publicized incidents involving the inappropriate collection, use, sharing or storage of
personal information have led to expanded governmental scrutiny of practices relating to the safeguarding of
personal information by companies. That scrutiny has in some cases resulted in, and could in the future lead to, the
adoption of stricter laws, rules and regulations relating to the collection, use, sharing and storage of personal
information. We will likely be subject to new and evolving data privacy laws in the U.S. and abroad, which could
result in additional costs of compliance, litigation, regulatory fines, and enforcement actions. These types of laws,
rules and regulations could prohibit or significantly restrict insurance companies, such as the Company, from
sharing information among affiliates or with third parties such as vendors, and thereby increase compliance costs, or
could restrict our use of personal data when developing or offering products or services to clients. These restrictions
could also inhibit our development or marketing of certain products or services or increase the costs of offering them
to clients.

**_We rely on data from our clients and third parties for pricing and underwriting our insurance policies,_**
**_the unavailability or inaccuracy of which could limit the functionality of our products and disrupt our business._**

We use data, technology and intellectual property licensed from unaffiliated third parties in certain of our
products, including insurance industry proprietary information that we license from third parties, and we may license
additional third-party technology and intellectual property in the future. Any errors or defects in this third-party
technology and intellectual property could result in errors that could harm our brand and business. In addition,
licensed technology and intellectual property may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms, or
at all. Also, should any third-party refuse to license its proprietary information to us on the same terms that it offers
to our competitors, we could be placed at a significant competitive disadvantage.

Further, although we believe that there are currently adequate replacements for the third-party technology
and intellectual property we presently use, the loss of our right to use any of this technology and intellectual
property could result in delays in producing or delivering affected products until equivalent technology or
intellectual property is identified, licensed or otherwise procured, and integrated. Our business would be disrupted if
any technology and intellectual property we license from others or functional equivalents of this software were
either no longer available to us or no longer offered to us on commercially reasonable terms. In either case, we
would be required either to attempt to redesign our products to function with technology and intellectual property
available from other parties or to develop these components ourselves, which would result in increased costs and
could result in delays in product sales and the release of new product offerings. Alternatively, we might be forced to
limit the features available in affected products. Any of these results could harm our business, results of operations
and financial condition.

**Legal and Regulatory Risks**

**_We are subject to extensive and evolving government regulation and supervision, which could increase_**
**_the cost of doing business, limit our ability to make investments and generate revenue, and lead to costly_**
**_examinations and/or enforcement actions._**

We are subject to supervision, regulation, and examination by regulators, including state departments of
insurance, the SEC and various other federal, state and self-regulatory agencies. Compliance with the requirements


-----

of these laws and regulations, among others, may be costly and could adversely affect our business. Certain aspects
of the Dodd-Frank Act and other legislative, regulatory and technological changes affect the Company’s operations.

The scope of regulation and the form of supervision may vary from state to state and insurance laws are often
complex and generally grant broad discretion to supervisory authorities in adopting regulations and supervising
regulated activities. This supervision generally includes the licensing of insurance brokers and agents and the regulation
of the handling of client funds held in a fiduciary capacity. Changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies or
their interpretation or implementation and the continued heightening of regulatory requirements could affect the
Company in substantial and unpredictable ways. State insurance regulators also possess broad powers to take
supervisory actions as they deem appropriate. These supervisory actions may result in higher compliance expenses
and limitations on the Company’s activities that could have a material adverse effect on operations or profitability.
Our continuing ability to provide insurance products and related employee benefits services in the states in which we
currently operate is dependent upon our compliance with the regulations promulgated from time to time by the
regulatory authorities in each of these states and our producers’ ability to attain and maintain licenses, which generally
may be granted, renewed or revoked at the discretion of state authorities for various reasons, including the violation of
regulations. In some instances, where there is uncertainty as to applicability, we follow practices based on our
interpretations of regulations or practices that we believe generally to be followed by the industry. These practices may
turn out to be different from the interpretations of regulatory authorities. If we do not have the requisite licenses and
approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, state insurance regulators could preclude or
temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities in their state or could otherwise penalize us. This
could adversely affect our ability to operate our business.

In all jurisdictions, the applicable laws and regulations are subject to amendment or interpretation by
regulatory authorities. State insurance regulators and legislatures continually re-examine existing laws and
regulations, some of which affect us, including those relating to the licensing of insurance brokers and agents,
premium rates, the regulation of unfair trade and claims practices, the regulation of underwriting practices, the
regulation of the handling and investment of policyholder and insurance carrier funds held in a fiduciary capacity and
regulation of business practices generally, including our compensation arrangements with insurers and clients. These
examinations may result in the enactment of insurance-related laws and regulations, or the issuance of interpretations
of existing laws and regulations, that adversely affect our business. More restrictive laws, rules or regulations may
be adopted in the future that could make compliance more difficult and/or expensive.

In addition, the method by which insurance intermediaries are compensated has received substantial
scrutiny from regulators in the past because of the potential for conflicts of interest. The potential for conflicts of
interest arises when an intermediary is compensated by two parties in connection with the same or similar
transactions. The vast majority of the compensation that we receive is in the form of commissions and fees. The
amount of compensation that we receive from insurance companies for contingent commissions, separate from
commissions and fees, has increased in the last several years. Future changes in the regulatory environment may
impact our ability to collect these revenue streams. In addition, these revenues present potential regulatory, litigation
and reputational risks that may arise from alleged conflicts of interest or allegations under antitrust, competition and
other laws. Adverse regulatory, legal or other developments regarding these revenues could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition, expose us to negative publicity and reputational
damage and harm our client, insurer or other relationships.

We also rely upon third parties who may expose the Company to compliance and legal risk. New or
existing legal requirements also could heighten the reputational impact of perceived misuses of customer data by the
Company and third parties.

We also are subject to existing and changing privacy and data security laws, regulations, and contractual
obligations. Our own actual or perceived failure, or the failure of third-party vendors with whom we do business, to
comply with these obligations could harm our business. The California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”), which
went into effect on January 1, 2020 and was expanded by the California Privacy Rights Act that went into effect on
January 1, 2023, is an example of the increasing costs of privacy compliance our business faces and the potential for
increased liability in the event of noncompliance or a data breach. Under the CCPA, California residents have a
number of new rights that are enforceable by the California Attorney General (for example, rights to access and
deletion of personal information), as well as a private right of action in the event of a data breach. The CCPA


-----

provides an exemption for personal information collected, processed, sold or disclosed pursuant to the GrammLeach-Bliley Act (the “GLBA”), the main federal privacy law governing financial institutions. Given this exception,
we are partially exempt from many of the requirements of the CCPA. Other states, including Colorado, Connecticut,
Delaware, Indiana, Iowa, Montana, New Jersey, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and Virginia, have also passed
privacy laws similar to the CCPA/CPRA, and numerous additional states are considering enacting privacy laws. Any
or all of these laws could further increase the costs and complexity of compliance. The impact of these laws on us
and others in our industry is unclear as they continue to develop and are subject to revisions and evolving judicial
interpretation.

**_Regulations affecting insurance carriers with whom we place business affect how we conduct our_**
**_operations._**

Insurers are also regulated by state insurance departments for solvency issues and are subject to reserve
requirements. We cannot guarantee that all insurance carriers with which we do business comply with the laws or
regulations enforced or instituted by state insurance departments. We may need to expend resources to address
questions or concerns regarding our relationships with these insurers, diverting management resources away from
operating our business.

**_Our business is subject to risks related to legal proceedings, regulatory investigations, and governmental_**
**_inquiries and actions._**

We are subject to litigation, regulatory investigations, including routine and sweep examinations, and
claims arising in the ordinary course of our business operations. The risks associated with these matters often can be
difficult to assess or quantify and the existence and magnitude of potential claims often remain unknown for
substantial periods of time. While we have insurance coverage for some of these potential claims, others may not be
covered by insurance, insurers may dispute coverage or any ultimate liabilities may exceed our coverage. We could
be subject to actions and claims relating to the sale, solicitation and negotiation of insurance (including underlying
securities in variable insurance and annuity products). Such actions and claims can further relate to issues such as
the suitability of such products and services, as well as denials of coverage or appropriately applying funds that we
hold for our customers on a fiduciary basis. Actions and claims can result in the rescission of such sales;
consequently, we can potentially seek to recoup commissions paid to us, which could lead to legal action against us.
The outcome of such actions cannot be predicted and such claims or actions could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We are subject to laws and regulations, as well as regulatory investigations. The insurance, investment
advisory, and broker-dealer industry has been subject to a significant level of scrutiny by various regulatory bodies,
including state Attorneys General offices, state departments of insurance, the SEC and other federal, state and selfregulatory agencies concerning certain practices within each of these specific industries. In particular, with respect
to insurance, these practices include, without limitation, the receipt of contingent commissions by insurance brokers
and agents from insurance companies and the extent to which such compensation has been disclosed, the collection
of agency fees, which we define as fees, separate from commissions, charged directly to clients for efforts
performed in the issuance of new insurance policies, bid rigging and related matters. From time to time, our
subsidiaries receive informational requests from governmental authorities. Further, the SEC continues to underscore
that investment advisers are fiduciaries, and as such, owe a duty of care and duty of loyalty to clients and investors,
continue to demonstrate compliance with new regulations, identify and disclose conflicts of interests, and implement
effective compliance programs specifically tailored to the investment adviser’s business. With respect to brokerdealers, the SEC and other federal, state and self-regulatory agencies regularly focuses on issues including, but not
limited to, suitability, appropriateness of sale charges and non-cash compensation. There have been a number of
revisions to existing, or proposals to modify or enact new, laws and regulations regarding insurance agents and
brokers, investment advisers, and broker-dealers. These actions have imposed or could impose additional obligations
on us with respect to our products sold and how we conduct our insurance, investment advisory and/or broker-dealer
business, including compliance with new regulations. Some insurance companies have agreed with regulatory
authorities to end the payment of contingent commissions on insurance products, which could impact our
commissions that are based on the volume, consistency and profitability of business generated by us.


-----

We cannot predict the impact that any new laws, rules or regulations may have on our business, financial
condition and results of operations. Given the current regulatory environment and the number of our subsidiaries
operating in local markets throughout the country, it is possible that we will become subject to further governmental
inquiries and subpoenas and have lawsuits filed against us. Regulators may raise issues during investigations,
examinations or audits that could, if determined adversely, have a material impact on us. The interpretations of
regulations by regulators may change and statutes may be enacted with retroactive impact. We could also be
materially adversely affected by any new industry-wide regulations or practices that may result from these
proceedings.

Our involvement in any investigations and lawsuits would cause us to incur additional legal and other costs
and, if we were found to have violated any laws, we could be required to pay fines, damages and other costs,
perhaps in material amounts. Regardless of final costs, these matters could have a material adverse effect on us by
exposing us to negative publicity, reputational damage, harm to client relationships or diversion of personnel and
management resources. The cost to defend such litigation may be significant. There may also be adverse publicity
associated with litigation, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable.
As a result, litigation may materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition and results of operations.

**_E&O claims and the outcome of actual and potential claims, lawsuits and proceedings may have a_**
**_material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows._**

We provide numerous professional services, including the placement of insurance and the provision of
consulting, and other services, to corporate and public clients. As a result of these activities, we have been subject to
various claims, lawsuits and proceedings that arise in the normal course of business. These matters principally
consist of alleged E&Os in connection with the placement of insurance and the rendering of administrative or
consulting services. E&Os could include, for example, our employees or sub-agents failing, whether negligently or
intentionally, to place coverage or to notify insurance carriers of claims on behalf of clients, or to provide insurance
carriers with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured. The placement of insurance and
the handling of claims involve substantial amounts of money. Since E&O claims against us may allege our potential
liability for all or part of the amounts in question, claimants may seek large damage awards, including punitive and
treble damages. These claims can involve significant defense costs and the damages may be in amounts that could, if
awarded, be significant and subject us to liability for monetary damages, negative publicity and divert personnel and
management resources. In addition, reputational damage caused by any of these matters could have a material
adverse effect on our business.

**_Proposed tort reform could decrease demand for liability insurance, thereby reducing our commission_**
**_income._**

Legislation concerning tort reform is periodically being considered by Congress and has been adopted in
several states. Among the provisions in such legislation are limitations on damage awards, including punitive
damages, and various restrictions applicable to class action lawsuits, including lawsuits asserting professional
liability of the kind for which insurance is offered under certain policies we sell to our clients. Enactment of these or
similar provisions by Congress or in additional states could result in a reduction in the demand for liability insurance
policies or a decrease in policy limits of such policies sold, thereby reducing our commission income.

**_Changes in tax laws or regulations that are applied adversely to us or our clients may have a material_**
**_adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition or results of operations._**

We are subject to taxation at the federal, state and local levels in the United States and various other
countries and jurisdictions. Our future effective tax rate and cash flows could be affected by changes in the
composition of earnings in jurisdictions with differing tax rates, changes in statutory rates and other legislative
changes, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in determinations regarding the
jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax, and our ability to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions. From
time to time, U.S. federal, state and local and foreign governments make substantive changes to tax rules and their
application, which could result in materially higher corporate taxes than would be incurred under existing tax law
and could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. We are subject to ongoing and periodic
tax audits and disputes in U.S. federal and various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. An unfavorable outcome


-----

from any tax audit could result in higher tax costs, penalties and interest, thereby adversely affecting our financial
condition or results of operations.

In addition, we are directly and indirectly affected by new tax legislation and regulation and the
interpretation of tax laws and regulations worldwide. Changes in such legislation, regulation or interpretation could
increase our taxes and have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. This includes
potential changes in tax laws or the interpretation of tax laws arising out of the Base Erosion Profit Shifting project
(“BEPS”) initiated by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”). In July and
October of 2021, the OECD/G-20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS released statements outlining a political agreement
on the general rules to be adopted for taxing the digital economy, specifically with respect to nexus and profit
allocation (Pillar One) and rules for a global minimum tax (Pillar Two). Further details regarding implementation of
these rules are expected to be finalized in the near future. These rules, should they implemented via domestic
legislation of countries or via international treaties, could have a material impact on our effective tax rate or result in
higher cash tax liabilities. There can be no assurance that our tax payments, tax credits, or incentives will not be
adversely affected by these or other initiatives.

**Accounting, Finance and Tax Risks**

**_Due to inherent limitations, there can be no assurance that our system of disclosure and internal_**
**_controls and procedures will be effective._**

There is no guarantee that our disclosure controls and internal controls over financial reporting and
procedures will be effective. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can
provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent
limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur
simply because of error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by individual acts of some persons,
by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of a control. There can be no assurance that the
design of any of our systems of controls will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future
conditions.

**_We could fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls and, consequently, may not be able to_**
**_report our financial results accurately._**

Although we have devoted management and financial resources to enhance our internal control over
financial reporting, all internal control systems, no matter how well-designed, have inherent limitations. Even those
systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement
preparation and presentation. Because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal controls may vary over
time. Any failure in the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could have a material effect on
our financial reporting, which could negatively impair our ability to execute our business strategy. Management
identified significant deficiencies in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2021, 2022 and 2023 related to the segregation of duties and the consistency of performance of controls by relevant
control owners, which we are in the process of remediating.

**_Changes in our accounting estimates and assumptions or changes in accounting standards could_**
**_negatively affect our financial position and operating results._**

We prepare our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
(“GAAP”). These accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated
financial statements. We are also required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during each reporting period. We periodically evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those
relating to the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets, income taxes, stock-based compensation, claims
handling obligations, retirement plans, litigation and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience
and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on specific circumstances. Actual results could
differ from these estimates. Additionally, changes in accounting standards could increase costs to the organization
and could have an adverse impact on our future financial position and results of operations.


-----

**_An impairment of goodwill could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of_**
**_operations._**

As of December 31, 2023, goodwill represented 37.5% of our total assets. Goodwill is not amortized and is
subject to assessment for impairment at least annually. The identification and measurement of goodwill impairment
involves the estimation of the fair value of our reporting units. We compare the fair value of each reporting unit with
its carrying amount to determine if there is potential impairment of goodwill. Management reviews the carrying
value attributed to each reporting unit at least annually to determine if the facts and circumstances suggest that there
is impairment. We may in the future be required to take additional goodwill or other asset impairment charges. Any
such non-cash charges could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

**Risks Related to the Transactions**

**_Our Sponsors’ interests may conflict with or differ from our interests or interests of holders of the notes._**

Upon consummation of the Transactions, our Sponsors will control our ultimate parent company, which
indirectly owns 100% of the Company’s equity. In addition, representatives or designees of our Sponsors will
comprise the majority of our ultimate parent company’s directors. As a result, our Sponsors will have the ability to
exercise substantial influence over us and our business, including, but not limited to, the authority to make changes
to our capital structure, implement repurchase programs, determine dividends and other distributions, incur
additional indebtedness, make acquisitions, sell our properties or other assets and undertake extraordinary
transactions, such as merging with other companies or liquidating us, appoint new management and approve actions
requiring the approval of our equityholders, including approving or rejecting proposed mergers or sales of all or
substantially all of our assets, regardless of whether noteholders believe that any such transactions are in their own
best interests.

The interests of our Sponsors may differ from yours in material respects. For example, if we encounter
financial difficulties or are unable to pay our debts as they mature, the interests of our Sponsors as equityholders
might conflict with your interests as a noteholder. Our Sponsors also may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions,
divestitures, financings (including financings that are secured) or other transactions that, in their judgment, could
enhance their equity investments, even though such transactions might involve risks to you as a noteholder.
Additionally, the agreements governing our indebtedness will permit us to pay management fees, dividends or make
other restricted payments under certain circumstances, and our Sponsors or their respective affiliates and/or advisors
may have an interest in our doing so. See “Certain Relations and Related Party Transactions” for a discussion of
certain payments made to affiliates of our Sponsors.

Our Sponsors and their respective affiliates and advisors are in the business of making or advising on
investments in companies and may, from time to time in the future, acquire interests in businesses or provide advice
that directly or indirectly compete with certain portions of our business or are suppliers or customers of ours. They may
also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to and/or competitive with our business and, as a
result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. You should consider that the interests of these
holders may differ from yours in material respects.

**_There are a number of risks and uncertainties associated with the proposed Acquisition._**

On February 20, 2024, we entered into the Acquisition Agreement. The Acquisition Agreement provides
for the acquisition of the Company by the Sponsors. The proposed Acquisition is subject to various risks and
uncertainties, including the following:

  - uncertainties as to the timing of the Acquisition;

  - the risk that the Acquisition may not be completed in a timely manner or at all;

  - the possibility that competing offers or acquisition proposals for the Company will be made;


-----

  - the possibility that any or all of the various conditions to the consummation of the Acquisition may not be
satisfied or waived;

  - the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the
Acquisition Agreement;

  - the effect of the announcement or pendency of the Transactions contemplated by the Acquisition
Agreement on our ability to retain and hire key personnel, our ability to maintain relationships with our
customers, suppliers and others with whom we do business, or our operating results and business generally;
and

  - risks related to diverting management’s attention from our ongoing business operations.

If the Acquisition is not consummated on substantially the terms described in this offering memorandum,
we will be required to redeem all of the notes at a redemption price equal to the initial issue price of such notes, plus
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, from the issue date up to, but excluding, the date of such special mandatory
redemption. Upon such redemption, you may not receive your expected return on the notes and may not be able to
reinvest the proceeds from the redemption in an investment that yields comparable returns. In addition, if you
purchase the notes at a price greater than the initial issue price of the notes, you may suffer a loss on your
investment.

**_Significant costs and significant indebtedness will be incurred in connection with the consummation of_**
**_the Transactions, including legal, accounting, financial advisory and other costs._**

We expect to incur significant costs in connection with completing the Transactions. These costs include
financing fees, advisory fees and other transaction costs and professional fees in connection with the Transactions,
and may include costs for employee retention, redeployment, relocation or severance and increased fees and
expenses beyond our current estimates, including due to delays in consummating the Transactions. See “Summary—
Sources and Uses” and “Use of Proceeds.”

While we expect to incur a significant amount of transaction fees and other one-time costs related to the
consummation of the Transactions, additional unanticipated costs may yet be incurred. In addition, we expect to
incur a number of non-recurring costs associated with our business initiatives, which cannot be estimated accurately
at this time.

**_We do not currently control the Company and will not control the Company until the completion of the_**
**_Acquisition._**

We do not currently control the Company and will not control the Company until the completion of the
Acquisition. Until that time, we cannot assure you that the Company will be operated in the same way that it would
be operated under our control. The covenants in the indenture governing the notes will not apply to the Company
until the consummation of the Acquisition.

**_We may not realize any or all of our estimated cost savings, which would have a negative effect on our_**
**_results of operations._**

In connection with the Acquisition, we expect to realize certain cost savings. Any cost savings that we
realize may differ materially from our estimates. The estimates of our cost savings contained herein are our current
estimates, but they involve risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that may cause our actual results,
performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements
expressed or implied by such estimates. Our ability to realize the expected cost savings associated with the
adjustments included or permitted by the indenture that will govern the notes and the credit agreements that will
govern the Senior Credit Facilities to be included when calculating Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and other nonGAAP financial measures depends on factors beyond our control, such as operating difficulties, increased operating
costs, competitors and customers, delays in implementing initiatives and general economic or industry conditions.


-----

We may be required to make significant cash expenditures to achieve such cost savings, and these cash costs are not
reflected in Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA. We cannot assure you that these cash expenditures to achieve such cost
savings will not be higher than anticipated. In addition, we may not fully realize such cost savings during the time
period anticipated, and may not do so at all. Accordingly, you should not view our presentation of this adjustment in
our Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA as a projection that we will achieve these cost savings, but rather only as an
indication of our current expectation and to show how “Consolidated EBITDA” will be calculated for the purposes
of covenant compliance in the indenture that will govern the notes and the credit agreements that will govern the
Senior Credit Facilities. Our ability to realize these anticipated savings is subject to significant uncertainties.
Although we believe these estimates and assumptions to be reasonable you should not place undue reliance on the
adjustments in evaluating our anticipated results. Further, no third party, including our independent auditor or any of
the initial purchasers, has performed any assurance procedures or expressed an opinion with respect to these
estimated cost savings, or their respective achievability.

In addition, any cost savings that we realize may be offset, in whole or in part, by reductions in revenues, or
through increases in other expenses, including as a result of the actions we take. If our cost savings are less than our
estimates or our cost savings initiatives adversely affect our business or cost more or take longer to implement than
we project, or if our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, our results could be lower than we anticipate.

Potential investors should regard the assumptions and projections with considerable caution and are urged
to evaluate the potential for any assumption to deviate from those set out in “Summary—Summary Historical
Consolidated Financial Information.”

**_Our inability to transition successfully to being a standalone company may have a material adverse_**
**_effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations._**

We have historically been a subsidiary of TFC, which provided us with certain support services. As a result
of the Acquisition, we will become an independent company and, accordingly, must further develop and implement
the systems and infrastructure necessary to support our current and future business. We cannot assure you that we
will make the transition successfully. In connection with the Acquisition, we will enter into a customary transition
services agreement with TFC, which covers various services for up to 18 months following the Completion Date.
Any delays in implementing required functionalities and systems may lead to increased operating expenses. We will
also incur costs in the future for expenses that have historically been part of TFC’s larger cost structure. Any failure
to transition successfully to an independent company may have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations.

Following completion of the Acquisition, we will be a smaller, less diversified company than TFC. As a
result, we may be more vulnerable to changing market conditions, which could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the diversification of our revenue, costs and cash
flows will diminish as a standalone company, such that our results of operations, cash flows, working capital and
financing requirements may be subject to increased volatility and our ability to fund capital expenditures and
investments, pay dividends and service debt may be diminished.

**Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the Notes**

**_Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition, our ability to operate our_**
**_business and react to changes in the economy or our industry, prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under_**
**_the notes or paying our other debts and could divert our cash flow from operations for debt payments. Despite our_**
**_indebtedness levels on the issue date of the notes after giving effect to the Transactions, we and our subsidiaries_**
**_may still be able to incur substantially more debt, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our_**
**_substantial leverage._**

We will have a substantial amount of debt, which requires significant interest and principal payments. As
of December 31, 2023, on an as adjusted basis after giving effect to the Transactions, the issuers and the guarantors
would have had total funded indebtedness of $8,000 million, $3,350 million of which would have been secured
indebtedness under the First Lien Term Loan Facility, $1,900 million of which would have been secured
indebtedness under the Second Lien Term Loan Facility and $2,750 million of which would have been secured


-----

indebtedness under the notes offered hereby. In addition, as of December 31, 2023, on an as adjusted basis after
giving effect to the Transactions, we would have had $1,175 million of availability to incur additional secured
indebtedness under our Revolving Credit Facility (assuming such facility is undrawn at closing of the Transactions).
Subject to the limits contained in the credit agreements that will govern the Senior Credit Facilities and the indenture
that will govern the notes offered hereby, we may be able to incur substantial additional debt from time to time to
finance working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions, or for other purposes. Further, the
restrictions in the indenture that will govern the notes and the credit agreements that will govern the Senior Credit
Facilities will not prevent us from incurring obligations, such as trade payables, that may not constitute indebtedness
as defined in such debt instruments. If we do so, the risks related to our high level of debt could increase.

Specifically, our high level of debt could have important consequences to the holders of the notes,
including the following:

    - it may be difficult for us to satisfy our obligations, including debt service requirements under our
outstanding debt, including the notes;

    - our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service
requirements, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes may be impaired;

    - requiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal
and interest on our indebtedness, including the notes, therefore reducing our ability to use our cash
flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures, future business opportunities and other purposes;

    - we are more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse industry conditions and our flexibility to
plan for, or react to, changes in our business or industry is more limited;

    - our ability to capitalize on business opportunities and to react to competitive pressures, as compared to
our competitors, may be compromised due to our high level of debt and the restrictive covenants in the
credit agreements that will govern the Senior Credit Facilities and the indenture that will govern the
notes offered hereby; and

    - our ability to borrow additional funds or to refinance debt may be limited.

If the issuers or the guarantors incur any additional indebtedness that ranks equally with the notes and
related guarantees, the holders of that debt will be entitled to share ratably with such holders in any proceeds
distributed in connection with any insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding up of an
issuer or a guarantor, subject to any collateral arrangements. This may have the effect of reducing the amount of
proceeds paid to the holders of the notes. Further, such secured debt would be effectively senior to any of the
issuers’ and guarantors’ existing and future unsecured indebtedness and junior lien indebtedness to the extent of the
value of the assets securing the notes.

**_Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our indebtedness_**
**_service obligations to increase significantly._**

Interest rates may increase in the future. As a result, interest rates on the Senior Credit Facilities or other
variable rate debt offerings could be higher or lower than current levels. As of December 31, 2023, on an as adjusted
basis after giving effect to the Transactions, we would have had approximately $5,250 million of outstanding debt at
variable interest rates (assuming the Revolving Credit Facility is undrawn at closing of the Transactions). If interest
rates increase, our debt service obligations on our variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount
borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our
indebtedness, would correspondingly decrease. Assuming the Revolving Credit Facility is fully drawn, each 0.125%
change in assumed blended interest rates would result in an approximately $8.0 million change in annual interest
expense on indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facilities.


-----

**_We may be unable to service our indebtedness, including the notes._**

Our ability to make scheduled payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, including the notes, depends
on and is subject to our financial and operating performance, which in turn is affected by general and regional
economic, financial, competitive, business and other factors and reimbursement actions of governmental and
commercial payors, all of which are beyond our control, including the availability of financing in the international
banking and capital markets. Lower total revenue generally will reduce our cash flow. We cannot assure you that
our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an
amount sufficient to enable us to service our debt, including the notes, to refinance our debt or to fund our other
liquidity needs.

If we are unable to meet our debt service obligations or to fund our other liquidity needs, we will need to
restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the notes, which could cause us to default on our debt
obligations and impair our liquidity. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of
the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our indebtedness could be at higher
interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants that could further restrict our business
operations.

Moreover, in the event of a default, the holders of our indebtedness, including the notes, could elect to
declare all the funds borrowed to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any. The lenders
under the Revolving Credit Facility could also elect to terminate their commitments thereunder, cease making
further loans and institute foreclosure proceedings against their collateral, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or
liquidation. If we breach our covenants under the Senior Credit Facilities, we would be in default thereunder. The
lenders could exercise their rights, as described above, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.

**_The credit agreements that will govern the Senior Credit Facilities and the indenture that will govern the_**
**_notes offered hereby will impose significant operating and financial restrictions on ParentCo and its restricted_**
**_subsidiaries (including the issuers), which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities._**

The credit agreements that will govern the Senior Credit Facilities and the indenture that will govern the
notes offered hereby will impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions will limit
the ParentCo’s ability and the ability of its restricted subsidiaries (including the issuers) to, among other things:

    - incur or guarantee additional debt or issue disqualified stock or preferred stock;

    - pay dividends and make other distributions on, or redeem or repurchase, capital stock;

    - make certain investments;

    - incur certain liens;

    - enter into transactions with affiliates;

    - merge or consolidate;

    - enter into agreements that restrict the ability of restricted subsidiaries to make dividends or other
payments to the issuers or the guarantors;

    - designate restricted subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries; and

    - transfer or sell assets.

ParentCo and its restricted subsidiaries (including the issuers) will be subject to covenants, representations
and warranties in respect of the Senior Credit Facilities, including a financial covenant, only applicable to the


-----

Revolving Credit Facility, as defined in the credit agreement that will govern the First Lien Credit Facilities. See
“Description of Certain Other Indebtedness.”

As a result of these restrictions, we will be limited as to how we conduct our business and we may be
unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business
opportunities. The terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants. We
cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and, if we fail to do
so, that we will be able to obtain waivers from the lenders and/or amend the covenants.

Our failure to comply with the restrictive covenants described above as well as other terms of our
indebtedness incurred in connection with the Transactions and/or the terms of any future indebtedness from time to
time could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in our being required to repay
these borrowings before their due date and may result in the acceleration of any other debt that is subject to an
applicable cross-acceleration or cross-default provision. The lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility could also
elect to terminate their commitments thereunder and cease making further loans. Furthermore, if we were unable to
repay the amounts due and payable under the Senior Credit Facilities, those lenders could proceed against the
collateral securing such indebtedness. In the event our lenders or holders of the notes accelerate the repayment of
our borrowings, we may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness or if we are forced to refinance these
borrowings on less favorable terms or cannot refinance these borrowings, our results of operations and financial
condition could be adversely affected.

**_A decline in our operating results or available cash could cause us to experience difficulties in_**
**_complying with covenants contained in more than one agreement, which could result in our bankruptcy or_**
**_liquidation._**

If we were to sustain a decline in our operating results or available cash, we could experience difficulties in
complying with the financial covenants contained in the indenture that will govern the notes and the credit
agreements that will govern the Senior Credit Facilities. The failure to comply with such covenants could result in
an event of default under the indenture that will govern the notes and/or the Senior Credit Facilities and by reason of
cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions, other indebtedness may then become immediately due and payable. In
addition, should an event of default occur, the lenders under our Revolving Credit Facility could elect to terminate
their commitments thereunder, cease making loans or institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets, and we
could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. If our operating performance declines, we may in the future need to
obtain waivers from the required lenders under our Senior Credit Facilities to avoid being in default. If we breach
our covenants under our Senior Credit Facilities and seek a waiver, we may not be able to obtain a waiver from the
required lenders. If this occurs, we would be in default under our Senior Credit Facilities, the lenders could exercise
their rights, as described above, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.

**_Repayment of our debt, including required principal and interest payments on the notes, is dependent on_**
**_cash flow generated by our subsidiaries, which may be subject to limitations beyond our control._**

Our subsidiaries own a substantial portion of our assets and conduct all of our operations. Accordingly,
repayment of our indebtedness, including the notes, is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries
and (if they are not guarantors of the notes) their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt
repayment or otherwise.

Certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory requirements of the jurisdictions in which they operate
or other restrictions that may limit the amounts that subsidiaries can pay in dividends or other payments to us.
Unless they are guarantors of the notes, ParentCo’s subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on
the notes or to make funds available to the issuers or the guarantors for that purpose. Our non-guarantor subsidiaries
may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our
indebtedness, including the notes. Each non-guarantor subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and, under certain
circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our non-guarantor
subsidiaries.

In the event that we are unable to receive distributions from subsidiaries, we may be unable to make
required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, including the notes.

**_Prior to or when the First Lien Credit Facilities mature, we may not be able to refinance or replace_**
**_them._**

The Revolving Credit Facility will have an earlier maturity date than the notes. The First Lien Term Loan
Facility will mature on or around the same date as the notes. Prior to or when the First Lien Credit Facilities mature,
we may need to refinance them and may not be able to do so on favorable terms or at all. If we are able to refinance
maturing indebtedness, the terms of any refinancing or alternate credit arrangements may contain terms and
covenants that restrict our financial and operating flexibility. If we are unable to refinance the First Lien Credit
Facilities prior to or when they mature, it could result in an event of default under the credit agreement that will
govern the First Lien Credit Facilities. Moreover, the occurrence of an event of default under the credit agreement
that will govern the First Lien Credit Facilities could result in an event of default under our other indebtedness,
including the indenture that will govern the notes.

**_Claims of holders of the notes will be structurally subordinated to claims of creditors of certain of our_**
**_subsidiaries that will not guarantee the notes._**

The notes will not be guaranteed by certain of our existing and future subsidiaries. Only ParentCo’s
existing wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries that guarantee indebtedness under the Senior Credit
Facilities (other than Panther Co-Issuer, which will be a guarantor under the Senior Credit Facilities and a co-issuer
of the notes) will initially guarantee the notes. Claims of holders of the notes will be structurally subordinated to the
claims of creditors of these non-guarantor subsidiaries, including trade creditors, and will not be satisfied from the
assets of these non-guarantor subsidiaries until their creditors are paid in full. As of and for the year ended
December 31, 2023, our non-guarantor subsidiaries represented approximately 3% of our consolidated revenues, 1%
of our consolidated assets, 1% of our consolidated liabilities and 5% of our consolidated EBITDA.

In addition, the guarantees of certain guarantors will be released in connection with a transfer of such
guarantor in a transaction not prohibited by the indenture that will govern the notes or upon certain other events
described in “Description of the Notes—Guarantees.” See “—There are circumstances, other than the repayment or
discharge of the notes, under which the collateral will be released automatically, without your consent or the consent
of the Notes Collateral Agent, and you may not realize any payment upon the release of such collateral.”

The indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby will permit these non-guarantor subsidiaries to
incur certain additional debt and will not limit their ability to incur other liabilities that are not considered
indebtedness thereunder.

**_Sales of assets by the issuers and the guarantors could reduce the collateral and the related guarantees._**

The security documents that will relate to the notes offered hereby will allow the issuers and the guarantors
to remain in possession of, retain exclusive control (except with respect to certain pledged collateral delivered for
purposes of perfection) over, freely operate and collect, invest and dispose of any income from, the collateral. To the
extent an issuer or a guarantor sells any assets that constitute such collateral, the proceeds from such sale will be
subject to the liens securing the notes offered hereby and the related guarantees only to the extent such proceeds
would otherwise constitute collateral securing the notes offered hereby and the related guarantees under the security
documents. Such proceeds will also be subject to the security interests of certain creditors other than the holders of
the notes, some of which may be senior or prior to the liens held by the holders of the notes, or may have a lien on
those assets that is pari passu with the lien of the holders of the notes (including the liens on the collateral held by
the lenders under the First Lien Term Loan Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility). To the extent the proceeds
from any sale of collateral do not constitute collateral under the security documents, the pool of assets securing the
notes and the related guarantees will be reduced, and the notes and the related guarantees will not be secured by such
proceeds.


-----

**_The value of the collateral securing the notes offered hereby and the related guarantees may not be_**
**_sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the notes._**

Obligations under the notes will be secured on a pari passu basis with the First Lien Credit Facilities and
on a senior basis to the Second Lien Term Loan Facility. No appraisal of the value of the collateral has been made in
connection with this offering, and we cannot assure you that the value of the collateral is equal to or greater than our
obligations with respect to the notes, the guarantees and the First Lien Credit Facilities. In addition, the fair market
value of the collateral is subject to fluctuations based on factors that include, among others, general economic
conditions. The amount to be received upon a sale of the collateral would be dependent on numerous factors,
including, but not limited to, the actual fair market value of the collateral at such time, the timing and the manner of
the sale and the availability of buyers. Likewise, we cannot assure you that the collateral will be saleable or, if
saleable, that there will not be substantial delays in its liquidation. In the event of a foreclosure, liquidation,
bankruptcy or similar proceeding, the collateral may not be sold in a timely or orderly manner, and the proceeds
from any sale or liquidation of the collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the issuers’ and the guarantors’
obligations under the notes, the guarantees, the First Lien Credit Facilities and any future debt that is secured by the
collateral. The indenture will allow us to incur additional secured debt, including under certain circumstances,
secured debt that will share in the collateral that will secure the notes and the guarantees.

To the extent that pre-existing liens, liens permitted under the indenture and other rights, such as those
securing certain purchase money obligations and capital lease obligations granted to other parties (in addition to the
holders of obligations secured by first-priority liens), encumber any of the collateral, those parties have or may
exercise rights and remedies with respect to the collateral that could adversely affect the value of the collateral and
the ability of the Notes Collateral Agent or the holders of the notes to realize or foreclose on the collateral.

The security interests in the collateral also will be subject to practical problems generally associated with
the realization of security interests in collateral. For example, the consent of a third-party may be required to obtain
or enforce a security interest in a contract. We cannot assure you that any such consent could be obtained. We also
cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given when and if required to facilitate a foreclosure
on such assets. Accordingly, the Notes Collateral Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets and
the value of the collateral may be significantly impaired. In addition, our business requires compliance with
numerous U.S. federal, state, provincial and local license and permit requirements. Continued operation of our
properties that are part of the collateral will depend on the continued compliance with such license and permit
requirements to the extent applicable, and our business and the value of the collateral may be adversely affected if
we fail to comply with these requirements or changes in these requirements. In the event of foreclosure, the transfer
of such permits and licenses may be prohibited or may require us to incur significant cost and expense. Furthermore,
we cannot assure you that the applicable governmental authorities will consent to the transfer of all such permits. If
the regulatory approvals required for such transfer are not obtained or are delayed, the foreclosure may be delayed,
our operations may be shut down and the value of the collateral may be significantly impaired.

There may not be sufficient collateral to pay off any amounts we may borrow under the notes, the First
Lien Credit Facilities and any other secured indebtedness we incur that ranks pari passu with or prior to the notes.

Consequently, liquidating the collateral may not result in proceeds in an amount sufficient to pay any
amounts due under the notes, the First Lien Credit Facilities and such other pari passu lien indebtedness after
satisfying the obligations to pay any creditors with prior liens. If the proceeds of the sale of the collateral pledged in
relation to the notes are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the notes, the First Lien Credit Facilities and such
other pari passu lien indebtedness, the holders of the notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of
the collateral) would have only an unsecured claim against the issuers’ and the guarantors’ remaining assets, which
may not be sufficient to repay our obligations under the notes.

In any bankruptcy proceeding with respect to an issuer or any of the guarantors that have guaranteed the
notes, it is possible that the bankruptcy trustee, the debtor-in-possession or competing creditors will assert that the
fair market value of the collateral with respect to the notes on the date of the bankruptcy filing was less than the
then-current principal amount of the notes and all of our other outstanding obligations secured by a senior or pari
_passu lien on the collateral. Upon a finding by the bankruptcy court that the notes are undercollateralized, the claims_
in the bankruptcy proceeding with respect to the notes would be bifurcated between a secured claim and an


-----

unsecured deficiency claim, and such unsecured claim would not be entitled to the benefits of security in the
collateral. In such event, the secured claims of the holders of the notes would be limited to the value of the
collateral. In addition, the holders of the notes would not be entitled to receive post-petition interest or applicable
fees, costs, expenses, or charges to the extent the amount of the obligations due under the notes, the First Lien Credit
Facilities and such other pari passu lien indebtedness exceeded the value of the collateral, or any “adequate
protection” on account of any undersecured portion of the notes.

**_The Notes Collateral Agent may not be the Applicable Authorized Representative under the Pari Passu_**
**_Intercreditor Agreement._**

The rights of the holders of the notes with respect to the collateral that will secure the notes will be subject
to the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement. Under the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, any actions that may be
taken with respect to collateral, including the ability to cause the commencement of enforcement proceedings
against such collateral or to control such proceedings, will be initially at the direction of the First Lien Credit
Facilities Collateral Agent until 120 days after the occurrence of an event of default under the agreement governing
and acceleration of the series of obligations representing the next largest outstanding principal amount of
indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority (as defined under “Description of the Notes”) and applicable notice
from the collateral agent with respect to such obligations; provided that such 120-day period shall be stayed with
respect to any collateral if the First Lien Credit Facilities Collateral Agent has commenced and is diligently pursuing
an enforcement action with respect to such collateral or the grantor of the security interest in such collateral
(whether an issuer or the applicable guarantor) is then a debtor under or with respect to (or otherwise subject to) an
insolvency or liquidation proceeding. In addition, under the terms of the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, if at
any time the Applicable Authorized Representative (as defined under “Description of the Notes”) forecloses upon or
otherwise exercises remedies against any collateral resulting in a sale thereof, the lien securing the notes and the
guarantees on such collateral will be automatically released and discharged.

If an issuer issues additional indebtedness that is senior to or equal in priority to the lien securing such
issuer’s notes in the future in a greater principal amount than the notes, then the authorized representative for such
additional indebtedness would be next in line to exercise rights under the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, rather
than the Notes Collateral Agent. Accordingly, the Notes Collateral Agent may never have the right to control
remedies and take other actions with respect to the collateral.

In addition, under the terms of the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, if at any time the Applicable
Authorized Representative forecloses upon or otherwise exercises remedies against any collateral resulting in a sale
thereof, the lien securing the notes on such collateral will be automatically released and discharged. The collateral so
released will no longer secure the issuers’ and the guarantors’ obligations under the notes and the related guarantees.
The holders of the notes will also waive certain important rights otherwise available to secured creditors in a
bankruptcy, as the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement will prohibit the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent from
objecting following the filing of a bankruptcy petition to a proposed debtor-in-possession financing to be provided
to us that is secured by the collateral or to the use of cash collateral that has not been opposed to or objected to by
the Applicable Authorized Representative or the other controlling secured parties, subject to certain conditions and
limited exceptions. After such a filing, the value of the collateral could materially deteriorate, and holders of the
notes would be unable to raise an objection.

Also, under the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, in the event that the holders of the notes obtain
possession of any collateral or realize any proceeds or payment in respect of any such collateral at any time prior to
the discharge of each of the other pari passu obligations, then such holders will be obligated to hold such collateral,
proceeds, or payment in trust for the other holders of such obligations and, subject to the Pari Passu Intercreditor
Agreement, promptly transfer such collateral, proceeds or payment, as the case may be, to the Applicable
Authorized Representative, to be distributed in accordance with the provisions of the Pari Passu Intercreditor
Agreement among all the holders of such obligations. Thus, under the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, the
holders of the notes may be obligated to turn over to the other holders of the pari passu obligations any collateral,
proceeds or payments they may receive.


-----

**_Many of the covenants in the indenture that will govern the notes will not apply to us if the notes are_**
**_rated investment grade by any two of Moody’s, S&P and Fitch._**

Many of the covenants in the indenture that will govern the notes will cease to apply to the notes during
such time, if any, as the notes are rated investment grade by any two of Moody’s, S&P and Fitch, provided that at
such time no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing. Although there can be no assurance that the
notes will ever be rated investment grade, or if they are rated investment grade, that the notes will maintain these
ratings, any suspension of the covenants under the indenture that will govern the notes would allow us to engage in
certain transactions that would not be permitted while these covenants were in effect. To the extent any suspended
covenants are subsequently reinstated, any actions taken by us while the covenants were suspended would not result
in an event of default under the indenture that will govern the notes on the basis that such actions would have been
prohibited by the covenants. See “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants.”

**_Federal and state fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance laws permit a court, under certain_**
**_circumstances, to void the notes and the guarantees (and the related security interests), and, if that occurs, you_**
**_may not receive any payments on the notes._**

The issuance of the notes and the guarantees (and the related security interests) may be subject to review
under federal and state fraudulent transfer and fraudulent conveyance statutes if a bankruptcy, liquidation or
reorganization case or a lawsuit, including under circumstances in which bankruptcy is not involved, were
commenced at some future date by the issuers, by the guarantors or by or on behalf of our unpaid creditors or the
unpaid creditors of a guarantor. While the relevant laws may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, the incurrence of
the obligations in respect of the notes and the guarantees (and the related security interests), will generally be a
fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer if (i) the transactions relating to the issuance of the notes or guarantees
(or the related security interests) were undertaken with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors or
(ii) an issuer or any of the guarantors, as applicable, received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair
consideration in return for issuing either the notes or a guarantee (or the related security interests) and, in the case of
(ii) only, any one of the following is also true:

    - an issuer or any of the guarantors was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of issuing the notes or
the guarantees (or the related security interests);

    - the issuance of the notes or guarantees (or the related security interests) left an issuer or any of the
guarantors with an unreasonably small amount of capital to carry on the business in which such issuer
or such guarantor was engaged or about to engage; or

    - an issuer or any of the guarantors intended to, or believed that we or it would, incur debts beyond our
or its ability to pay as they become due.

If a court were to find that the issuance of the notes or a guarantee (or the related security interests) was a
fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer, the court could void the payment obligations under the notes or such
guarantee or further subordinate the notes or such guarantee to presently existing and future indebtedness of such
issuer or such guarantor, or require the holders of the notes to repay any amounts received with respect to the notes
or such guarantee, or the holders of the notes could lose the benefits such security interests were intended to provide.
In the event of a finding that a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer occurred, you may not receive any
repayment on the notes. Further, the voidance of the notes could result in an event of default with respect to our
other debt and that of the guarantors that could result in acceleration of such debt.

The measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer laws vary
depending upon the law of the jurisdiction that is being applied, such that we cannot be certain as to: the standards a
court would use to determine whether or not the issuers or the guarantors were solvent at the relevant time, or,
regardless of the standard that a court uses, that it would not determine that the issuers or a guarantor was indeed
insolvent on that date; that any payments to the holders of the notes (including under the guarantees) did not
constitute preferences, fraudulent transfers or conveyances on other grounds; or that the issuance of the notes and
the guarantees would not be subordinated to the issuers’ or any guarantor’s other debt.


-----

Generally, an entity would be considered insolvent if, at the time it incurred indebtedness:

    - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair value of all its assets;

    - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its
probable liability on its existing debts and liabilities, including contingent liabilities, as they become
absolute and mature; or

    - it could not pay its debts as they become due.

As a general matter, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or
obligation, property is transferred or a valid antecedent debt is satisfied. A court would likely find that an issuer or a
guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the notes or such guarantee (or the
related security interests) if such issuer or such guarantor did not substantially benefit directly or indirectly from the
issuance of the notes or the applicable guarantee (or the related security interest). Thus, if the guarantees were
legally challenged, any guarantee could be subject to the claim that, since the guarantee was incurred for the issuers’
benefit, and only indirectly for the benefit of the guarantor, the obligations of the applicable guarantor were incurred
for less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration. Therefore, a court could void the obligations under
the guarantees, subordinate them to the applicable guarantor’s other debt or take other action detrimental to the
holders of the notes.

To the extent a court avoids any of the guarantees as fraudulent transfers or fraudulent conveyances or
holds any of the guarantees unenforceable for any other reason, the holders of notes would cease to have any direct
claim against the applicable guarantor. If a court were to take this action, the applicable guarantor’s assets would be
applied first to satisfy the applicable guarantor’s other liabilities, if any, and might not be applied to the payment of
the guarantee. Sufficient funds to repay the notes may not be available from other sources, including the remaining
guarantors, if any. In addition, the court might direct you to repay any amounts that you already received from the
applicable issuer or the applicable guarantor.

Although each guarantee entered into in connection with the notes will contain a provision intended to limit
that guarantor’s liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations
under its guarantee to be a fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance, this provision may not be effective as a
legal matter or otherwise to protect those guarantees from being avoided under fraudulent transfer or fraudulent
conveyance law or otherwise, or may reduce that guarantor’s obligation to an amount that effectively makes its
guarantee worthless.

In addition, any payment by an issuer pursuant to the notes or by a guarantor under a guarantee made at a
time such issuer or such guarantor was found to be insolvent could be voided as a preferential transfer and required
to be returned to such issuer or such guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of such issuer’s or such guarantor’s
creditors if such payment is made to an insider within a one-year period prior to a bankruptcy filing or within 90
days for any non-insider party, and such payment would give such insider or non-insider party more than such
creditors would have received in a distribution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in a hypothetical Chapter 7 case.

Finally, as a court of equity, the bankruptcy court may otherwise subordinate the claims in respect of the
notes or the guarantees to other claims against the issuers or the guarantors under the principle of equitable
subordination, if the court determines that: (i) the holder of the notes engaged in some type of inequitable conduct;
(ii) such inequitable conduct resulted in injury to our other creditors or conferred an unfair advantage upon the
holder of the notes; and (iii) equitable subordination is not inconsistent with the provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy
Code.

**_If we or a guarantor become the subject of a bankruptcy proceeding, applicable bankruptcy laws may_**
**_limit your ability to realize value from the collateral or to receive post-petition interest, fees or expenses._**

The right of the Notes Collateral Agent to foreclose upon, repossess and dispose of the collateral during the
continuance of an event of default under the indenture that will govern the notes is likely to be significantly impaired


-----

(or at a minimum delayed) by applicable bankruptcy law if a bankruptcy case were to be commenced by or against
an issuer or a guarantor before the Notes Collateral Agent repossessed and disposed of the collateral.

In particular, upon the commencement of a case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, a secured creditor such
as the Notes Collateral Agent is prohibited from foreclosing upon or repossessing its collateral from a debtor in a
bankruptcy case, or from disposing of collateral previously repossessed from such debtor, without prior bankruptcy
court approval, which may not be given under the circumstances. Moreover, the U.S. Bankruptcy Code permits the
debtor to continue to retain and use cash and other collateral even though the debtor is in default under the
applicable debt instruments, provided that the secured creditor is given “adequate protection.” The meaning of the
term “adequate protection” may vary according to circumstances, but it is intended in general to protect the value of
a secured creditor’s interest in its collateral as of the commencement of the bankruptcy case and may include cash
payments or the granting of additional or replacement collateral if and at such times as the bankruptcy court in its
discretion determines that the value of the secured creditor’s interest in its collateral is declining during the
pendency of the bankruptcy case. A bankruptcy court may determine that a secured creditor may not require
compensation for a diminution in the value of its collateral if the value of the collateral exceeds the debt it secures.

In view of the lack of a precise definition of the term “adequate protection” and the broad discretionary
power of a bankruptcy court, it is impossible to predict:

    - whether or when payments under the notes could be made following the commencement of a
bankruptcy case by the issuers or a guarantor, or the length of any delay in making such payments;

    - whether or when the Notes Collateral Agent could or would repossess or dispose of the collateral;

    - the value of the collateral at the time of the bankruptcy petition or at any other point in time thereafter;
or

    - whether or to what extent the holders of the notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or
loss of value of the collateral through the requirement for “adequate protection” or otherwise.

Any disposition of the collateral during a bankruptcy case would also require prior permission from the
bankruptcy court (which may not be given under the circumstances). Furthermore, in the event a bankruptcy court
determines the value of the collateral is not sufficient to repay all amounts due on our other debt that is also to be
paid first out of the proceeds of the collateral (including our obligations under the First Lien Term Loan Facility and
the Revolving Credit Facility), the holders of the notes would hold a secured claim only to the extent of the value of
the collateral to which the noteholders are entitled and an unsecured claim with respect to any shortfall. The U.S.
Bankruptcy Code permits the payment and accrual of post-petition interest, costs, expenses and attorneys’ fees or
“adequate protection” to a secured creditor during a debtor’s bankruptcy case only to the extent the value of its
collateral is determined by the bankruptcy court to exceed the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the
obligations secured by the collateral, and such amounts would not be permitted to be paid if the collateral value is
not sufficient.

Also, the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement will impose various limitations on the notes noteholders with
respect to their rights to object to proposed debtor-in-possession financing and/or the use of cash collateral that has
not been opposed to or objected to by the Applicable Authorized Representative or the other controlling secured
parties.

**_Rights of holders of the notes in the collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to create or_**
**_perfect the security interests._**

The collateral securing the notes and the related guarantees will include substantially all of the issuers’ and
the guarantors’ tangible and intangible assets which assets also secure the issuers’ and the guarantors’ indebtedness
under the Senior Credit Facilities, whether now owned or acquired or arising in the future. Applicable law requires
that a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be properly perfected and its priority
retained through certain actions undertaken by the secured party. The liens on the collateral securing the notes may


-----

not be perfected if we are not able to take the actions necessary to perfect any of these liens on or prior to the date of
the issuance of the notes or thereafter as the indenture will permit us to perfect certain liens after the issue date. We
will have limited obligations to perfect the security interest of the holders of the notes in specified collateral other
than the filing of financing statements. To the extent a security interest in certain collateral is not properly perfected
on the date of the issuance of the notes, such security interest might be avoidable in bankruptcy, which could impact
the value of the collateral. See “—Any future security interest or guarantee may be avoidable in bankruptcy.”

If additional material wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries are formed or acquired and become
guarantors under the indenture that will govern notes, additional financing statements would be required to be filed
to perfect the security interest in the assets of such guarantors. Depending on the type of the assets constituting afteracquired collateral, additional action may be required to perfect the security interest in such assets. Applicable law
requires that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest can be perfected only at
the time such property and rights are acquired and identified. Neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent will
be responsible to monitor, and the issuers may not inform the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent of, the future
acquisition of property and rights that constitute collateral, and that the necessary action will be taken to properly
perfect the security interest in such after-acquired collateral. None of the Trustee, the Notes Collateral Agent and the
First Lien Credit Facilities Collateral Agent will have any obligation to monitor the acquisition of additional
property or rights that constitute collateral or monitor the perfection of, or make filings to perfect or maintain the
perfection of, any security interests therein. Such inaction may result in the loss of the security interest in such
collateral or the priority of the security interest in favor of the notes and the guarantees against third parties. Even if
the liens on collateral acquired or arising in the future are not properly perfected, such liens may potentially be
avoidable as a preference or as a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer in any bankruptcy proceeding under
certain circumstances. See “—Any future security interest or guarantee may be avoidable in bankruptcy” and “—
Federal and state fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance laws permit a court, under certain circumstances, to
void the notes and the guarantees (and the related security interests), and, if that occurs, you may not receive any
payments on the notes.”

**_Security interests over certain collateral will not be in place on the Completion Date or will not be_**
**_perfected on such date and such security interests may face a greater risk of being voidable as a preference._**

Certain security will not be in place on the Completion Date or will not be perfected on such date.
Consequently, if a default should occur prior to the perfection of such security interests, holders of the notes may not
benefit from any such unperfected security interests.

The delivery of security interests in certain collateral, including after-acquired property, is also expected to
be made after the Completion Date. If the grantor of any such security interest were to become subject to a
bankruptcy proceeding, any liens recorded or perfected or any mortgages delivered after the Completion Date would
face a greater risk of being invalidated than if they had been recorded, perfected or delivered on the Completion
Date. In bankruptcy proceedings commenced within 90 days of lien perfection or mortgage delivery, a lien or
mortgage given to secure previously existing debt is significantly more likely to be voided as a preference by the
bankruptcy court than if delivered and promptly recorded on the Completion Date (or within 30 days thereof).
Accordingly, if a grantor were to file for bankruptcy protection after the Completion Date and the liens had been
perfected or the mortgages had been delivered less than 90 days before commencement of such bankruptcy
proceeding (or within a year for an “insider”), or not yet perfected or delivered at all, the liens or mortgages securing
the notes may be especially subject to challenge as a result of having not been perfected or delivered on the
Completion Date (or within 30 days thereof). To the extent that such challenge succeeded, you would lose the
benefit of the security that the collateral was intended to provide and could be required to return amounts already
paid.

If the grantor of any such security interest were to become subject to a bankruptcy proceeding, any liens
recorded or perfected or any mortgage or security interest in collateral delivered by such grantor after the
Completion Date may face a greater risk of being voidable as a preference under bankruptcy law than if such liens
or security interests had been recorded, perfected or delivered on the Completion Date (or within 30 days thereof).
Liens recorded or perfected or any mortgages delivered after the Completion Date (or within 30 days thereof) may
be treated under bankruptcy law as if they were delivered to secure previously existing indebtedness. If certain
circumstances exist or occur (including if the person pledging or granting such security interest is insolvent at the


-----

time of the pledge or grant of the security interest), if the pledge or security interest permits the holders of the notes
to receive a greater recovery than such holders would have received in a distribution in a hypothetical Chapter 7 case
under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code than if the security interest had not been pledged or granted, and a bankruptcy
proceeding in respect of the grantor is commenced within 90 days following the pledge or grant, or, within a oneyear period if it is granted or pledged to an insider, such pledge or grant of such security interest may face a greater
risk of being voidable as a preference under bankruptcy law by the pledgor (as debtor in possession) or by its trustee
in bankruptcy or other third parties. To the extent that any such grant or pledge is voided as a preference, you would
lose the benefit of the security interest in the applicable collateral.

**_Results of the lien searches have not yet been obtained and lien searches may not reveal all liens on the_**
**_collateral._**

Results of the lien searches have not yet been obtained and we cannot guarantee that the lien searches on
the collateral that will secure the notes and guarantees thereof will reveal any or all existing liens on such collateral.
Any such existing lien, including undiscovered liens, could be significant, could rank prior to the liens securing the
notes and guarantees thereof and could have an adverse effect on the ability of the Notes Collateral Agent to realize
or foreclose upon the collateral securing the notes and guarantees thereof.

**_The imposition of certain permitted liens will, under certain circumstances, permit the liens on the_**
**_related assets securing the notes and the related guarantees to be either subordinated to such permitted liens or_**
**_released. There are also certain other assets that are also excluded from the collateral._**

The indenture that will govern the notes will permit liens in favor of third parties to secure additional
indebtedness, including purchase money indebtedness and capital lease obligations, and, in the case of certain of
such liens, the liens on the related assets securing the notes and the related guarantees may, under certain
circumstances, be either subordinated to such permitted liens or released. Our ability to incur additional
indebtedness and liens on such additional indebtedness in favor of third parties is subject to limitations as described
herein under the headings “Description of the Notes.” In addition, certain assets are excluded from the collateral
securing the notes and the related guarantees, as discussed under “Description of the Notes—Security.” If an event
of default occurs and the maturity of the notes is accelerated, the notes and the related guarantees will rank pari
_passu with the holders of other unsecured indebtedness of the relevant obligor with respect to such excluded assets._
As a result, if the value of the assets pledged as security for the notes is less than the value of the claims of the
holders of the notes, those claims may not be satisfied in full before the claims of our unsecured creditors are paid.

**_There are circumstances, other than the repayment or discharge of the notes, under which the collateral_**
**_will be released automatically, without your consent or the consent of the Notes Collateral Agent, and you may_**
**_not realize any payment upon the release of such collateral._**

Under various circumstances, the collateral will be released automatically, without action by, or consent of,
any holder of the notes or the Trustee under the indenture that will govern the notes, including:

    - upon a sale, transfer or other disposition of such collateral (to a person that is not an issuer or a
guarantor) in a transaction not prohibited under the indenture that will govern the notes. See
“Description of the Notes—Release of Collateral”;

    - with respect to collateral held by a guarantor of the notes, upon the release of such guarantor from its
guarantees in accordance with the indenture that will govern the notes;

    - pursuant to the terms of the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, upon any release in connection with a
foreclosure or exercise of remedies with respect to such collateral by the Applicable Authorized
Representative in accordance with the terms of the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement; and

    - if the notes have achieved Investment Grade Status (as defined herein).


-----

The indenture that will govern the notes will also permit us to designate one or more of ParentCo’s
restricted subsidiaries that is a guarantor of the notes as an unrestricted subsidiary. If the issuers designate a
guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary for purposes of the indenture that will govern the notes, all of the liens on any
collateral owned by that subsidiary or any of its subsidiaries and any guarantees of the notes by that subsidiary or
any of its subsidiaries will be released under the indenture that will govern the notes. Designation of an unrestricted
subsidiary will reduce the aggregate value of the collateral securing the notes to the extent that liens on the assets of
the unrestricted subsidiary and its subsidiaries are released. In addition, the creditors of any such unrestricted
subsidiary and its subsidiaries will have a claim on the assets of the unrestricted subsidiary and its subsidiaries
senior to the claim of the holders of the notes.

You will not have a claim as a creditor against any subsidiary that is no longer a guarantor of the notes, and
the indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables, whether secured or unsecured, of those nonguarantor subsidiaries will be structurally senior to claims of noteholders.

**_The lenders under the First Lien Credit Facilities have the discretion to release any guarantor under the_**
**_First Lien Credit Facilities in a variety of circumstances, which will cause such guarantor to be released from its_**
**_guarantee of the notes._**

While any obligations under the First Lien Credit Facilities remain outstanding, a guarantor’s guarantee of
the notes may be released without action by, or consent of, any holder of the notes or Trustee under the indenture
that will govern the notes, at the discretion of lenders under the First Lien Credit Facilities, if the guarantor no
longer guarantees obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities. See “Description of the Notes.” The lenders under
the First Lien Credit Facilities have the discretion to release the guarantees under the First Lien Credit Facilities in a
variety of circumstances. You will not have a claim as a creditor against any subsidiary that is no longer a guarantor
of the notes, and the indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables, whether secured or unsecured, of
those non-guarantor subsidiaries will be structurally senior to claims of noteholders.

**_Any future security interest or guarantee may be avoidable in bankruptcy._**

Collateral pledged or perfected upon, or guarantees issued, after the issue date of the notes may be treated
under bankruptcy law as if they were pledged or perfected upon to secure, or delivered to guarantee, as applicable,
previously existing indebtedness. Any future pledge or perfection of collateral or issuance of a guarantee in favor of
the holders of the notes (including any Liens delivered or reinstated after the Reversion Date and/or pursuant to
guarantees delivered in connection therewith after the date the notes are issued) may be avoidable by the pledgor (as
a debtor in possession), guarantor (as a debtor in possession), by its trustee in bankruptcy, or potentially by other
creditors if certain events or circumstances exist or occur, including, among others, if (1) the pledgor or guarantor is
insolvent at the time of the pledge or perfection and/or issuance of the guarantee, (2) the pledge or perfection and/or
issuance of the guarantee (as applicable) permits the holders of the notes to receive a greater recovery in a
hypothetical Chapter 7 case than if such pledge or perfection and/or guarantee (as applicable) had not been given
and (3) a bankruptcy proceeding in respect of the pledgor or guarantor is commenced within 90 days following the
pledge or the perfection thereof as the case may be, and/or the issuance of the guarantee (as applicable), or, in
certain circumstances, one year. Accordingly, if an issuer or any guarantor were to file for bankruptcy protection
after the issue date of the notes and any pledge of collateral not pledged, or any guarantees not issued, on the issue
date of the notes had been pledged or perfected or issued (as applicable) less than 90 days before the commencement
of such bankruptcy proceeding, such pledges or guarantees are materially more likely to be avoided as a preference
by the bankruptcy court than if delivered on the issue date of the notes (even if the other guarantees or liens (as
applicable) issued and/or perfected on the issue date of the notes would no longer be subject to such risk). To the
extent that the grant or perfection of any such security interest and/or guarantee is avoided as a preference or
otherwise, you would lose the benefit of the security interest and/or guarantee (as applicable) and could have to
return payments or property to us.

**_Because each guarantor’s liability under its guarantees may be reduced to zero, voided or released under_**
**_certain circumstances, holders of notes may not receive any payments from some or all of the guarantors._**

Holders of notes have the benefit of the guarantees of the guarantors. However, the guarantees by the
guarantors are limited to the maximum amount that the guarantors are permitted to guarantee under applicable law.


-----

As a result, a guarantor’s liability under its guarantee could be reduced to zero, depending upon the amount of other
obligations of such guarantor. Further, under the circumstances discussed more fully above, a court under federal or
state fraudulent conveyance and fraudulent transfer statutes could void the obligations under a guarantee or further
subordinate it to all other obligations of the guarantor. See “—Federal and state fraudulent transfer or fraudulent
conveyance laws permit a court, under certain circumstances, to void the notes and the guarantees (and the related
security interests), and, if that occurs, you may not receive any payments on the notes.” In addition, you will lose the
benefit of a particular guarantee if it is released under certain circumstances described under “Description of the
Notes—Guarantees.”

**_We may not be able to finance a change of control offer or asset sale offer required by the indenture that_**
**_will govern the notes._**

Upon a change of control, as defined under the indenture that will govern the notes, you will have the right
to require the issuers to offer to purchase all of the notes then outstanding at a price equal to 101% of the principal
amount of the notes, plus accrued interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of purchase in certain circumstances. In
order to obtain sufficient funds to pay the purchase price of the outstanding notes, we expect that we would have to
refinance the notes. We cannot assure you that we would be able to refinance the notes on reasonable terms, if at all.
The issuers’ failure to offer to purchase all outstanding notes or to purchase all validly tendered notes would be an
event of default under the indenture that will govern the notes. Such an event of default may cause the acceleration
of our other debt, including debt under the Senior Credit Facilities. Our future debt also may contain restrictions on
repayment requirements with respect to specified events or transactions that constitute a change of control under the
indenture that will govern the notes.

In addition, upon the occurrence of certain specified asset sales, the issuers will be required to offer to
purchase outstanding notes and indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facilities, at 100% of the principal amount
thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of purchase in certain circumstances. The
source of funds for any such purchase of the notes will be the issuers’ available cash or cash generated from the
issuers’ operations or other sources, including borrowings, sales of assets or sales of equity. The issuers may not be
able to purchase the notes upon such an asset sale offer because the issuers may not have sufficient financial
resources at the time of such asset sale to make the required purchase of notes and such other indebtedness, or
because restrictions in the issuers’ other indebtedness will not allow such purchase of the notes. Any of the issuers’
future debt agreements may contain similar provisions.

Accordingly, if such an asset sale were to occur, the issuers may not have sufficient financial resources to
purchase the notes and such other indebtedness that the issuers would be required to offer to purchase or that
become immediately due and payable as a result. The issuers may require additional financing from third parties to
fund any such purchases, and we cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain financing on satisfactory terms
or at all. See “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and
Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock.” The issuers’ failure to pay holders tendering notes and such
other indebtedness upon such an asset sale would result in an event of default under the indenture that will govern
the notes.

**_We can enter into transactions like recapitalizations, reorganizations and other highly leveraged_**
**_transactions that do not constitute a change of control but that could adversely affect the holders of the notes._**

Certain important corporate events, such as leveraged recapitalizations, may not, under the indenture that
will govern the notes, constitute a “change of control” that would require the issuers to purchase the notes,
notwithstanding the fact that such corporate events could increase the level of our indebtedness or otherwise
adversely affect our capital structure, credit ratings or the value of the notes. Therefore, we could, in the future, enter
into certain transactions, including acquisitions, reorganizations, refinancings or other recapitalizations, which
would not constitute a change of control under the indenture that will govern the notes, but that could increase the
amount of indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings.


-----

**_Holders of notes may not be able to determine when a change of control giving rise to their right to have_**
**_the notes purchased has occurred following a sale of “substantially all” of our assets._**

The definition of change of control in the indenture that will govern the notes includes a phrase relating to
the sale of “all or substantially all” of our assets. There is no precise established definition of the phrase
“substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of notes to require the issuers to
purchase its notes as a result of a sale of less than all our assets to another person may be uncertain. See “Description
of the Notes—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change of Control.”

**_An active trading market may not develop for the notes._**

We cannot assure you that an active trading market will develop for the notes. We do not intend to apply
for listing of the notes on any securities exchange or on any automated dealer quotation system. Although we have
been informed by certain of the initial purchasers that they currently intend to make a market for the notes, they are
not obliged to do so and any market making may be discontinued at any time without notice.

The liquidity of, and trading market for, the notes may also be adversely affected by, among other things:

    - changes in the overall market for securities similar to the notes;

    - changes in our financial performance or prospects;

    - the prospects for companies in our industry generally;

    - the number of holders of the notes;

    - the interest of securities dealers in making a market for the notes;

    - the conditions of the financial markets; and

    - prevailing interest rates.

The condition of the financial markets and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated in the past and are likely
to fluctuate in the future, which could have an adverse effect on the market prices of the notes.

Historically, the market for non-investment grade debt has been subject to disruptions that have caused
substantial volatility in the prices of securities that are similar to the notes. We cannot assure you that the market, if
any, for any of the notes will be free from similar disruptions or that any such disruptions may not adversely affect
the prices at which you may sell your notes. In addition, subsequent to their initial issuance, the notes may trade at a
discount from their initial offering price, depending upon prevailing interest rates, the market for similar notes, our
performance, and other factors. You should be aware that you may be required to bear the financial risk of an
investment in the notes for an indefinite period of time.

**_There are restrictions on transfer on your ability to transfer or resell the notes._**

The notes are being offered and sold pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act
and applicable state securities laws. Therefore, you may transfer or resell the notes in the U.S. only in a transaction
registered under or exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities
laws, and you may be required to bear the risk of your investment for an indefinite period of time. The issuers are
not obligated to register the notes under the Securities Act or to offer to exchange the notes in an exchange offer
registered under the Securities Act. As a result, for so long as the notes remain outstanding, they may be transferred
or resold only in transactions exempt from the registration requirements of federal and applicable state securities
laws.


-----

**_The indenture that will govern the notes will not be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act and we will_**
**_not be required to comply with the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act._**

The indenture that will govern the notes will not be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act and we will not
be required to comply with the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act. Therefore, holders of the notes will not be
entitled to the benefit of the provisions and protection of the Trust Indenture Act except to the extent there are
similar provisions in the indenture that will govern the notes.

**_We are not providing all of the information that would be required if this offering were being registered_**
**_with the SEC._**

This offering memorandum does not include all of the information that would be required if we were
registering this offering of the notes with the SEC. In particular, this offering memorandum does not comply with
SEC requirements for registered offerings regarding the presentation of financial statements, and includes “pro
forma” financial information that is not determined or calculated in accordance with the SEC’s rules and regulations.
The reduced financial statement disclosure and such “pro forma” information could impair your ability to evaluate
your investment in the notes. We cannot assure you that our historical financial information or such “pro forma”
information set forth in this offering memorandum will be indicative of our future financial performance or our
ability to meet our obligations, including repayment of the notes. We urge you to consider this factor in connection
with your evaluation of your investment in the notes.

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may be_**
**_subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the notes. The ratings may not
reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed herein and
other factors that may affect the value of the notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold
securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No assurance
can be given that a credit rating will remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be
lowered or withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant,
such as adverse changes in our business. A negative change in or an indication of a possible negative change in any
of our ratings could have an adverse effect on the trading and market price of the notes. A suspension, reduction or
withdrawal at any time of any credit rating by one or more of the credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost
and terms and conditions of our financings, including the interest rate on the Senior Credit Facilities, or result in
higher borrowing costs. Any future lowering of our ratings likely would make it more difficult or more expensive
for us to obtain additional debt financing. If any credit rating initially assigned to the notes is subsequently lowered
or withdrawn for any reason, you may not be able to resell such notes without a substantial discount.

**_A lowering or withdrawal of the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating agencies may adversely_**
**_affect the market price or liquidity of the notes._**

Credit rating agencies continually revise their ratings for the companies that they follow, including us.
Credit rating agencies also evaluate our industry as a whole and may change their credit ratings for us based on their
overall view of our industry. The notes offered hereby will have a non-investment grade rating on the issue date.
There can be no assurances that such rating will remain for any given period of time or that such rating will not be
lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in that rating agency’s judgment, future circumstances relating
to the basis of the rating, such as adverse changes, so warrant. Credit ratings are not recommendations to purchase,
hold or sell the notes, and may be revised or withdrawn at any time. Additionally, credit ratings may not reflect the
potential effect of risks relating to the structure or marketing of the notes. If the credit rating of the notes is
subsequently lowered or withdrawn for any reason, you may not be able to resell your notes without a substantial
discount.


-----

**_The terms of the Senior Credit Facilities have not yet been finalized._**

The credit agreements relating to the Senior Credit Facilities have not been finalized. Our ability to
successfully syndicate the Senior Credit Facilities is subject to market conditions and we cannot assure you that the
Senior Credit Facilities will be successfully syndicated on the terms described herein. Future changes in market
conditions may result in changes to the terms for the Senior Credit Facilities, including pricing, that are less
favorable to us and may increase our interest expense and adversely affect our business.

**_The indenture that will govern the notes will contain periodic reporting requirements that will be_**
**_different and less burdensome than would be applicable to us if we had agreed to register the notes immediately_**
**_following the closing of the offering._**

The indenture that will govern the notes will require us to provide annual, quarterly and certain material
current reports to the holders of the notes and the Trustee. The content of the reports required by the indenture will,
however, be more limited than if we were subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. See
“Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Reports and Other Information.”

**_Unless the Acquisition will be consummated on the closing date of this offering, between the time of the_**
**_issuance of the notes and the consummation of the Acquisition, the parties to the Acquisition Agreement may_**
**_agree to modify or waive the terms or conditions of such document without noteholder consent._**

Prior to the consummation of the Acquisition, the parties to the Acquisition Agreement may agree to
amendments or waivers of, or consents to departures or deviations from, the terms thereof and holders of the notes
will not have the ability to veto any such actions. Although no such amendment, waiver or consent is presently
contemplated, if the parties to the Acquisition Agreement decide to make changes to the terms thereof (including to
the purchase price) or to waive conditions thereunder, the holders of the notes will not be able to prevent the release
of the Escrowed Property to fund the Acquisition as a result of any such action and will not have any veto or consent
rights in respect of any such actions.

**_Unless the Acquisition will be consummated on the closing date of this offering, if the Escrow_**
**_Conditions are not satisfied, the Escrow Issuers will be required to redeem the notes, which means that you may_**
**_not obtain the return you expect on the notes._**

Unless the Acquisition will be consummated on the closing date of this offering, the gross proceeds from
this offering of the notes will be deposited into the Escrow Account. The release of the Escrowed Property to the
Escrow Issuers to consummate the Acquisition will be subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including the
closing of the Acquisition substantially concurrently with or promptly following the release of such Escrowed
Property. The consummation of the Acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including, among others,
the receipt of applicable regulatory approvals and the expiration or termination of applicable waiting periods. If the
Acquisition is not consummated on or prior to the Escrow Outside Date, or upon the occurrence of certain other
events, the Escrowed Property will not be released to the Escrow Issuers to consummate the Acquisition but instead
will be released to the Trustee under the indenture that will govern the notes for the purpose of redeeming the notes
pursuant to a special mandatory redemption described in “Description of the Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special
Mandatory Redemption” and you may not obtain the return you expect to receive on the notes.

The special mandatory redemption price will be a price equal to 100% of the initial issue price of the notes
plus accrued and unpaid interest from the issue date of the notes to, but excluding, the special mandatory redemption
date. Additional cash in respect of interest that would accrue on the notes from and after the issue date of the notes
will not be pre-funded into the Escrow Account on the issue date of the notes, but the Sponsors (directly or through
one or more of their affiliates) will commit on or prior to the closing date of this offering, in the event of a special
mandatory redemption, to fund the difference between the amounts in the Escrow Account that are available to be
applied to redeem the notes pursuant to the special mandatory redemption and the special mandatory redemption
price plus the fees and expenses of the Trustee and the Escrow Agent. There can be no assurance that the Sponsors
will have sufficient funds necessary to pay any shortfall required to fund a special mandatory redemption.


-----

Upon a special mandatory redemption, you may not be able to reinvest the proceeds from the redemption in
an investment that yields comparable returns. In addition, if you purchase the notes at a price greater than the price
at which the notes are redeemed, you may suffer a loss on your investment. Although the Trustee, for the benefit of
the holders of the notes, will be granted a first-priority lien on the funds in escrow, the ability of holders of the notes
to realize such funds would generally be subject to certain bankruptcy and insolvency law limitations in the event of
the bankruptcy or insolvency of the Escrow Issuers. See “Description of the Notes— Escrow of Proceeds; Special
Mandatory Redemption.”

**_If this offering closes prior to the consummation of the Acquisition, the notes will be obligations solely of_**
**_the Escrow Issuers until the Acquisition is consummated._**

If this offering closes prior to the consummation of the Acquisition and the proceeds of the notes are
deposited into the Escrow Account, prior to the consummation of the Acquisition, holders of the notes will not have
any recourse to TIH, McGriff Insurance, the guarantors or any of their respective subsidiaries, and the notes will be
the obligations solely of the Escrow Issuers. The Escrow Issuers are limited purpose entities and do not hold or
otherwise have any interest in any material assets other than the Escrow Account. As a result, the sole recourse of
the holders prior to the consummation of the Acquisition will be to the funds deposited in the Escrow Account.

**_In a bankruptcy proceeding, the holders of notes might not be able to apply the Escrowed Property to_**
**_repay the notes without bankruptcy court approval._**

If either of the Escrow Issuers commences a bankruptcy or reorganization case, or one is commenced
against the Escrow Issuers, while the Escrow Account remains funded, bankruptcy law may prevent the Trustee
under the indenture that will govern the notes from using the Escrowed Property to pay the special mandatory
redemption price. The court adjudicating that case might find that the Escrow Account and the Escrowed Property
are the property of the bankruptcy estate. Although the amounts in the Escrow Account will be pledged as security
for the notes during the term of the escrow, the automatic stay provisions of the federal bankruptcy laws generally
prohibit (or at a minimum delay) secured creditors from foreclosing upon or disposing of a debtor’s property without
prior bankruptcy court approval (which may not be given under the facts and circumstances). As a result, holders of
the notes may not be able to have the funds in the Escrow Account applied at the time or in the manner
contemplated by the indenture that will govern the notes and could suffer a loss as a result. If the court adjudicating
that case finds that the Escrow Account and Escrowed Property are the property of the bankruptcy estate, the court
could authorize the use of such funds by the bankruptcy estate or the bankruptcy trustee, if one is appointed, with or
without restrictions. As a result, the holders of the notes could become unsecured creditors of the bankruptcy estate.
In such event, the only remedy available to the holders of the notes would be to sue for payment on the notes.


-----

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

We estimate that our net proceeds from this offering, after deducting the initial purchasers’ discount, will
be approximately $      million. Upon satisfaction of the Escrow Conditions (if applicable), we intend to use the
net proceeds from this offering, together with borrowings under the Senior Credit Facilities and the proceeds from
the Equity Contribution, to (i) finance and consummate the Transactions, (ii) pay fees, costs, premiums and
expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions and (iii) fund cash to the Company’s balance sheet.

The table set forth below sets forth the estimated sources and uses of funds in connection with the
Transactions. Actual amounts will vary from the estimated amounts shown below depending on several factors,
including, among others, the number of TIH equityholders who elect to participate in the Rollover, changes made to
the sources of the contemplated financings and differences from estimated fees and expenses.

You should read the following together with the information included under the headings “Summary—The
Transactions” and “Capitalization” included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

**Sources** **Amount** **Uses** **Amount**

(in millions)
Senior Credit Facilities:
First Lien Term Loan Facility[(1)] ................... $ 3,350 Equity purchase price[(6)] ....................... $ 15,500
Revolving Credit Facility[(2)] .......................... — Transaction fees and expenses[(7)] 346
Second Lien Term Loan Facility[(3)] ............... 1,900 Cash to balance sheet .......................... 150
Notes offered hereby[(4)] ...................................... 2,750
Equity Contribution[(5)] ....................................... 7,996
**Total sources ...................................................** 15,996 **Total uses ...........................................** $ 15,996

(1) In connection with the consummation of the Acquisition, we intend to enter into the First Lien Term Loan Facility, which

will provide for a seven-year first lien senior secured term loan facility. The total amount available under the First Lien
Term Loan Facility will be $3,350 million, which is expected to be fully drawn at the closing of the Acquisition. For a
description of the First Lien Term Loan Facility, see “Description of Certain Other Indebtedness—Senior Credit Facilities.”

(2) We expect the Revolving Credit Facility to provide for borrowings of up to $1,175 million outstanding at any one time. We

expect the Revolving Credit Facility to be undrawn at the closing of the Acquisition. The amount drawn on the Revolving
Credit Facility after giving effect to the Transactions is subject to change based on the timing of the closing of the
Acquisition and working capital requirements at the time of closing of the Acquisition. See “Description of Certain Other
Indebtedness—Senior Credit Facilities.”

(3) In connection with the consummation of the Acquisition, we intend to enter into the Second Lien Term Loan Facility, which

will provide for an eight-year second lien senior secured term loan facility. The total amount available under the Second
Lien Term Loan Facility will be $1,900 million, which is expected to be fully drawn at the closing of the Acquisition. For a
description of the Second Lien Term Loan Facility, see “Description of Certain Other Indebtedness—Senior Credit
Facilities.”

(4) Represents the aggregate principal amount of the notes offered hereby and does not reflect the initial purchasers’ discount or

estimated fees and expenses related to this offering.

(5) Represents the Sponsor Contribution and amounts contributed by existing TIH equityholders in the Rollover. The actual

amount of the Sponsor Contribution will depend on certain factors, including the amount of TIH equity contributed in the
Rollover and the amount outstanding under the Existing Facility at the closing of the Acquisition.

(6) Represents the estimated purchase price for TIH’s equity expected to be outstanding at the closing of the Acquisition.

(7) Represents estimated fees, costs and expenses associated with the Transactions, including, without limitation, initial

purchaser discounts, financing fees, amounts payable under the Acquisition Agreement and any fees and expenses incurred
in connection therewith, fees, expenses and accrued and unpaid interest with respect to the Existing Facility (to the extent
any amounts are payable thereunder at the closing of the Acquisition) and any original issue discount, agency fees and
underwriting fees on the Senior Credit Facilities. All fees, expenses and the other costs are estimates and actual amounts
may differ from those set forth in this offering memorandum.


-----

Certain of the initial purchasers and/or their affiliates have also agreed to provide interim financing to
us with respect to a bridge facility to finance a portion of the Acquisition under certain circumstances in the
event that the notes are not released from escrow, for which the initial purchasers or their respective affiliates
will be paid customary fees. In addition, certain of the initial purchasers and/or their affiliates have committed
to act as arrangers, agents and/or lenders under our Senior Credit Facilities and will receive customary
compensation in connection therewith. In addition, SPC Capital Markets, LLC, which is an initial purchaser in
this offering, is an affiliate of Stone Point, one of our Sponsors. In addition, Truist Securities, Inc., which is an
initial purchaser in this offering, is an affiliate of Truist, a seller under the Acquisition Agreement. See “Plan of
Distribution.”


-----

**CAPITALIZATION**

The following table sets forth our consolidated cash and cash equivalents and capitalization as of December
31, 2023 on:

    - an actual basis; and

    - an as adjusted basis after giving effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred on December 31,
2023.

The information in this table should be read in conjunction with “Summary—The Transactions,”
“Summary—Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Information,” “Use of Proceeds” and “Description of
Certain Other Indebtedness” and the financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this offering
memorandum.

**As of December 31, 2023**

**(in millions)** **Actual** **As Adjusted**

**(unaudited)**

Cash and cash equivalents ................................................................... $ 734 $ 150 [(1)]

Long-term debt (including the current portion thereof):[(2)]
Existing Facility[(3)] ........................................................................... — —
Senior Credit Facilities:[(4)] ................................................................
First Lien Term Loan Facility .................................................. — 3,350
Revolving Credit Facility ......................................................... — —
Second Lien Term Loan Facility.............................................. — 1,900
Notes offered hereby[(5)] .................................................................... — 2,750

Total long-term debt (including the current portion thereof) ............... — 8,000
Total members’ equity ......................................................................... 599 7,996[(6)]

Total capitalization[(7)] ........................................................................... $ 1,333 $ 15,996

(1) Represents estimated cash and cash equivalents at closing of the Acquisition after deducting estimated fees, costs and

expenses associated with the Transactions. The actual amount of cash and cash equivalents at the closing of the Transactions
may change due to the timing of the Acquisition, differences from estimated fees and expenses and working capital
requirements.

(2) Debt amounts reflect the principal amount of such indebtedness without giving effect to original issue discount or other

financing costs. For the year ended December 31, 2023, on an as adjusted basis after giving effect to the Transactions, we
estimate that our cash interest expense would have been $674.8 million, which reflects estimates for the Senior Credit
Facilities and the notes offered hereby using a weighted average blended estimate rate. Borrowings under the Senior Credit
Facilities bear interest at variable rates and are subject to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, the debt service
obligations on the loans would increase and cash required for servicing indebtedness would increase. Assuming the
Revolving Credit Facility is fully drawn, each 0.125% change in assumed blended interest rates would result in an
approximately $8.0 million change in annual interest expense on indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facilities. See
“Summary—Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Information.”

(3) The Existing Facility will be repaid (to the extent any amounts are payable thereunder at the closing of the Acquisition) and

terminated at the closing of the Acquisition.

(4) After giving effect to the Transactions, the Senior Credit Facilities will consist of the First Lien Term Loan Facility,

providing $3,350 million of first lien term loans, the Revolving Credit Facility, providing for up to $1,175 million of
revolving extensions of credit outstanding at any time (including revolving loans and letters of credit), and the Second Lien
Term Loan Facility, providing for $1,900 million of second lien term loans. We expect the First Lien Term Loan Facility
and Second Lien Term Loan Facility to be fully drawn and the New Revolving Credit Facility to be undrawn at the closing
of the Acquisition. The amount drawn on the Revolving Credit Facility after giving effect to the Transactions is subject to


-----

change based on the timing of the closing of the Acquisition and working capital requirements at the time of closing of the
Acquisition. See “Description of Certain Other Indebtedness.”

(5) Represents the aggregate principal amount of the notes offered hereby, without giving effect to discounts, fees or

commissions to be paid to the initial purchasers, and assumes the notes are issued at par.

(6) As adjusted amount represents amounts invested directly or indirectly in our equity securities by funds affiliated or

controlled by the Sponsors in connection with the Transactions. Total members’ equity, as adjusted for the Transactions,
excludes approximately $346 million of estimated fees, costs and expenses associated with the Transactions.

(7) Calculated as total members’ equity plus total debt, in each case as described above.

**MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF**

**OPERATIONS**

_The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations covers periods_
_prior to the consummation of the Transactions, except for the “Liquidity and Capital Resources Following the_
_Transactions” and “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” subsections. Accordingly, the_
_discussion and analysis of historical periods does not reflect the impact that the Transactions will have on us. You_
_should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the_
_financial statements and related notes included in this offering memorandum. This discussion contains forward-_
_looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those described in_
_the “Risk Factors” section of this offering memorandum. Actual results may differ materially from those contained_
_in any forward-looking statements._

**Overview**

We are one of the leading insurance brokers in the United States and provide a broad array of insurance
products and services (including P&C, employee benefits, life and title insurance) through our diversified

Specialty Programs and Title businesses. Through our businesses we deliver end-to-end coverage across the
insurance distribution chain, making us well positioned to serve our clients. We have an insurance distribution
business model and do not retain underwriting risk on our balance sheet.

**Results of Operations**

The following discussion and analysis regarding results of operations should be considered in conjunction
with the consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this offering
memorandum.

**_Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2023 and 2022_**

Financial information relating to 2023 and 2022 is as follows:

**Net income attributable to controlling interests** $ 217 (50) % $ 439

_Commission and Fees_

Commissions and fees for 2023 increased $336 million to $3,388 million, or 11% over 2022. The increase
is composed of:

(i) a $241 million increase in base commissions, which reflects a growth rate of 10%, driven by (a)

$114 million from the acquisition of BenefitMall in September 2022, which, due to timing, led to
only a partial year’s contribution in terms of commission revenues for 2022 versus a full year for
2023 and (b) $174 million from growth in new and retained business in the Retail and Wholesale
segments; partially offset by a (a) $34 million decrease related to certain businesses within the
Wholesale segment covering catastrophic property & casualty risks and (b) $13 million decrease
related to the Services segment due to rising interest rates, which was partially offset by the March
2022 acquisition of Kensington Vanguard which contributed a full year of revenues for 2023
versus a partial year for 2022; and

(ii) a $96 million increase in fees, which reflects a growth rate of 21%, driven by (a) $33 million

increase in the Retail segment driven by rising premiums driving more insureds to fee
arrangements, (b) $60 million increase in the Wholesale segment primarily driven by increases in
underwriting program fees, and (c) $3 million increase in the Services segment primarily driven
by increases in fees from 1031 exchange services due to higher interest rates; partially offset by

(iii) a $1 million decrease in supplemental and contingent commissions, driven by a $14 million net

decrease in the Wholesale segment driven by adverse developments in ultimate loss ratios and
increasing rates of catastrophes, partially offset by (a) an $8 million increase in the Retail segment
driven by overall premium growth and (b) $5 million from the BenefitMall acquisition that less
comparable revenues (i.e., over a shorter period) in 2022.

|Net income attributable to controlling interests $ 217|(50) %|$ 439|


-----

Investment income for 2023 was $66 million, compared with an immaterial amount in 2022. The increase
was primarily driven by a movement of funds to interest-bearing deposit accounts in 2023 to support the Company’s
standalone operations.

_Other Income_

Other income for 2023 was $13 million, compared with $32 million in 2022. Other income primarily
relates to income from non-recurring legal settlements and other miscellaneous income and therefore can fluctuate
between comparable periods.

_Compensation and Benefits_

Compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of total revenues was 64% for the year ended
December 31, 2023 as compared to 62% for the year ended December 31, 2022, and increased $296 million or 15%
from 2022. The increase was primarily due to: (i) increase of $89 million related to the BenefitMall and Kensington
Vanguard acquisitions; (ii) increase in severance expenses of $23 million related to a strategic restructuring in 2023;
and (iii) the remaining $184 million increase primarily relates to increased producer compensation attributed to
revenue growth as well as an increase in employee compensation attributed to increased headcount and acquisition
earnouts.

_Other Operating Expenses_

Other operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues was 15% for the year ended December 31, 2023
as compared to 14% for the year ended December 31, 2022. Other operating expenses for 2023 increased $90
million, or 21%, for the same period of 2022. The increase was primarily due to: (i) expenses of $21 million relating
to legal matters; (ii) expenses of $24 million related to corporate allocations due to an increase in allocated costs
from TFC for corporate functions; (iii) a $25 million increase in software expense; (iv) an increase of $9 million
related to the BenefitMall and Kensington Vanguard acquisitions; (v) an increase of $32 million primarily relating to
variable travel and entertainment costs due to post-COVID increases in travel; partially offset by (vi) a $21 million
reduction in merger-related costs due to no acquisitions in 2023.

_Amortization_

Amortization expense for 2023 increased $7 million to $134 million, or 5% over 2022. The increase
reflects the amortization of new intangibles that were accounted for as asset acquisitions, net of certain intangible
assets becoming fully amortized or written off.

_Depreciation_

Depreciation expense stayed the same at $23 million for 2023 compared to 2022.

_Impairment loss on Goodwill_

During 2023, the Services segment observed declines in forecasted income due to a decline in commercial
and residential real estate transactions attributable to rising interest rates. The Company concluded that these factors
were indicative of a triggering event that required the Company to perform an interim quantitative goodwill
impairment assessment. The results of the quantitative impairment assessment indicated that the carrying value of
the Services segment exceeded its fair value. As a result, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment loss of $195
million in the year ended December 31, 2023, which reduced the goodwill in the Services segment to zero. There
was no impairment loss on goodwill recorded in 2022.

_Interest Expense_

Interest expense for 2023 was $317 million which was primarily attributable to the preferred units issued in
April 2023. Due to the mandatory redemption feature, the preferred units are classified as liabilities rather than as a


-----

component of equity, with the preferred annual returns of 8% per annum being accrued and recorded as Interest in
the consolidated statements of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2023, of the total Interest expense,
$315 million related to the preferred units, of which $210 million was paid during the period. As the preferred units
were issued in April 2023, the Company did not recognize interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2022.
For more information relating to the preferred units, refer to Note 9. Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Units to the
consolidated financial statements that are included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

_Income Taxes_

As Truist Insurance Holdings, Inc. was converted into a Delaware limited liability company (the
“Partnership Conversion”) named Truist Insurance Holdings, LLC in February 2023, the provision for income taxes
for the year ended December 31, 2022 reflects the impacts of U.S. corporate taxation at an effective tax rate of 25%;
whereas the provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2023 is reflective of (i) the discretely
calculated corporate tax impacts for January and February 2023 (prior to the Partnership Conversion) of $29 million,
(ii) the tax benefit associated with the corporate deferred tax liability transfer to the Parent of $166 million, (iii) the
tax benefit associated with the transfer of the unrecognized tax benefit to the Parent of $1 million, and (iv) tax
impacts attributable to the remaining ten months in the year, calculated on a post Partnership Conversion basis.

For periods after the Partnership Conversion, federal income taxes will not be allocated to TIH, its
subsidiary partnerships, or subsidiary disregarded entities; as such, the applicable federal statutory tax rate impact
for the year ended December 31, 2023 is zero.

_Commission and Fees_

Commissions and fees for 2022 increased $412 million to $3,051 million, or 16% over 2021. The increase
is composed of:

(i) a $327 million increase in Base Commissions, which reflects a growth rate of 15% driven by (a)

$43 million and $63 million from the BenefitMall and Kensington Vanguard acquisitions,


-----

respectively, for which there were no comparable Base Commissions for 2021 and $69 million
from the Constellation acquisition, which, due to timing, led to only a partial year’s contribution in
terms of Base Commissions for 2021, (b) $152 million from growth in new and retained business
in the Retail and Wholesale segments;

(ii) a $70 million increase in Fees, which reflects a growth rate of 18%, driven by (a) $16 million from

the Kensington Vanguard which had no comparable Fees for 2021 and $34 million from the
Constellation acquisitions, which due to timing, led to only a partial year’s contribution in terms of
Fees for 2021, (b) $12 million net increase in the Wholesale segment primarily driven by increases
in underwriting program fees and brokerage fee income, and (c) $8 million increase in the Retail
segment driven by rising premiums driving more insureds to fee arrangements; and

(iii) a $15 million increase in Supplemental and Contingent Commissions, driven by (a) $6 million

from the BenefitMall acquisition which had no comparable revenues for 2021 and the
Constellation acquisitions which, due to timing led to only a partial year’s contribution in terms of
revenues for 2021 and (b) $9 million increase in the Retail segment driven by overall premium
growth.

_Other Income_

Other income for 2022 was $32 million, compared with $11 million in 2021. Other income primarily
relates to income from non-recurring legal settlements and other miscellaneous income and therefore can fluctuate
between comparable periods.

_Compensation and Benefits_

Compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of total revenues was 62% for the year ended
December 31, 2022 as compared to 62% for the year ended December 31, 2021, and increased 17%, or $271
million. The increase was primarily due to (i) increase of $140 million related to the BenefitMall, Kensington
Vanguard, and Constellation acquisitions, (ii) the remaining $131 million increase primarily relates to increased
producer compensation attributed to revenue growth.

_Other Operating Expenses_

Other operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues was 13.8% for the year ended December 31,
2022 as compared to 12% for the year ended December 31, 2021. Other operating expenses for 2022 increased $110
million, or 35%, for the same period of 2021. The increase was primarily due to: (i) increase of $29 million related
to the BenefitMall, Kensington Vanguard, and Constellation acquisitions, and due to timing of these acquisitions,
there were no comparable other operating expenses for BenefitMall and Kensington Vanguard and a partial year’s
contribution of other operating expenses for Constellation in 2021; (ii) expenses of $24 million related to corporate
allocations due to an increase in allocated costs from TFC for corporate functions; (iii) increase of $14 million of
merger-related costs due to 2022 acquisitions; and the remaining $43 million increase primarily relates to variable
travel and entertainment costs due to post-COVID increases in travel.

_Amortization_

Amortization expense for 2022 increased $25 million to $127 million, or 25% over 2021. The increase
reflects the amortization of new intangibles that were recognized in connection with the acquisitions of
Constellation, BenefitMall and Kensington Vanguard, net of certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized or
written off.

_Depreciation_


-----

Depreciation expense for 2022 increased $3 million to $23 million, or 14% from 2021. Changes in
depreciation expense reflect net additions of fixed assets, net of the impact of fixed assets that became fully
depreciated during the period.

_Income Taxes_

Income tax expense for 2022 increased $12 million to $150 million, or 8% from 2021. The provisions for
income taxes represent effective tax rates of 25% and 24% for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,
respectively.

**Acquisitions**

The Company did not complete any business acquisitions in 2023. Refer to Note 5. Business Combinations
to the consolidated financial statements that are included elsewhere in this offering memorandum for more
information.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources Following the Transactions**

**_Overview_**

We expect that the Transactions will require total cash of approximately $15,996 million (assuming no
Rollover), which will be used to fund the Transactions, pay related fees and expenses and fund cash to the
Company’s balance sheet. The amount of cash required to fund the Transactions will be reduced based on the
amount of TIH shares contributed by existing TIH equityholders in the Rollover. The amount of cash required to
fund the Transactions, as well as the cash and cash equivalent on the Company’s balance sheet at the closing of the
Transactions, may be impacted by the timing of the Acquisition, differences from estimated fees and expenses and
working capital requirements. See “Use of Proceeds” and “Capitalization.” We expect the cash requirements of the
Transactions to be financed through the net proceeds from this offering, proceeds from our Senior Credit Facilities
and the Equity Contribution. Following the closing of the Transactions, we believe that our cash on hand and
availability under the Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to cover our operating expenses in the near term.
We expect the Revolving Credit Facility to be undrawn at the closing of the Acquisition. The amount drawn on the
Revolving Credit Facility after giving effect to the Transactions is subject to change based on the timing of the
closing of the Acquisition and working capital requirements at the time of closing of the Acquisition.

Upon completion of this offering, our long-term debt for borrowed money will be comprised of the notes
and indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facilities.

After the consummation of the Transactions, our primary sources of liquidity will be cash on the balance
sheet, cash generated by operations and borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. Our primary uses of cash
after the consummation of the Transactions will be working capital requirements, debt service requirements and
capital expenditures. Based on our current level of operations and available cash, we believe our cash flows from
operations, combined with availability under the Revolving Credit Facility, will provide sufficient liquidity to fund
our current obligations, projected working capital requirements, debt service requirements and capital spending
requirements over the next twelve months and the foreseeable future. We cannot assure you, however, that our
business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under
the Revolving Credit Facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness, including the notes, or to
fund our other liquidity needs. Our ability to do so depends on prevailing economic conditions, many of which are
beyond our control. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain events, such as a change of control, we could be
required to repay or refinance our indebtedness. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our
indebtedness, including the Senior Credit Facilities and the notes, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Any
future acquisitions, joint ventures or other similar transactions will likely require additional capital, and there can be
no assurance that any such capital will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.

After the consummation of the Transactions, we will be highly leveraged. On an as adjusted basis giving
effect to the Transactions, as of December 31, 2023, we would have had outstanding $8,000 million in aggregate


-----

indebtedness for borrowed money (excluding capital and financing leases), with approximately $1,175 million
available for borrowing under our Revolving Credit Facility (assuming it is undrawn at closing). Our liquidity
requirements will be significant, primarily due to debt service requirements. On an as adjusted basis giving effect to
the Transactions, our cash interest expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 would have been
approximately $674.8 million. Assuming the Revolving Credit Facility is fully drawn, each 0.125% change in
assumed blended interest rates would result in an approximately $8.0 million change in annual interest expense on
indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facilities.

From time to time, depending upon market and other conditions, as well as upon our cash balances and
liquidity, we, our subsidiaries or our affiliates may acquire our outstanding debt securities or our other indebtedness
through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, tender offers, redemption or otherwise, upon such
terms and at such prices as we, our subsidiaries or our affiliates may determine (or as may be provided for in the
indentures, if applicable), for cash or other consideration. For additional information regarding our material
indebtedness upon the completion of the Transactions, see “Summary—The Transactions,” “Description of Certain
Other Indebtedness” and “Description of the Notes.”

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk**

Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest
rates, foreign exchange rates and equity prices. We are exposed to market risk through our investments and the
Senior Credit Facilities.

Our invested assets are held primarily as cash and cash equivalents and fiduciary cash. These investments
are subject to interest rate risk. The fair value of our invested assets at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022,
approximated their respective carrying values due to their short-term duration and therefore, such market risk is not
considered to be material.

We do not actively invest or trade in equity securities. In addition, we generally dispose of any equity
securities received in conjunction with an acquisition shortly after the acquisition date.

Our principal exposure to market risk following the Transactions will relate to changes in interest rates on
borrowings under the Senior Credit Facilities. The Senior Credit Facilities will carry floating interest rates that are
tied to SOFR, and therefore, our statement of consolidated operations data and our cash flows will be exposed to
changes in interest rates to the extent that we do not have effective hedging arrangements in place. As of December
31, 2023, on an as adjusted basis after giving effect to the Transactions, we would have had approximately $5,250
million of outstanding debt at variable interest rates (assuming the Revolving Credit Facility is undrawn at closing of
the Transactions). If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on our variable rate indebtedness would
increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash
available for servicing our indebtedness, would correspondingly decrease. Assuming the Revolving Credit Facility is
fully drawn, each 0.125% change in assumed blended interest rates would result in an approximately $8.0 million
change in annual interest expense on indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facilities. We do not use derivative
financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes; however, this does not preclude our adoption of specific
hedging strategies in the future.

**Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates**

Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation
of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. We continually evaluate estimates, which are based
upon a combination of historical experience and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the
circumstances. Such estimates form the basis for our judgments about the recognition of revenues, expenses,
carrying values of assets and liabilities, of which values are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results
may differ from these estimates.


-----

We believe that of our significant accounting and reporting estimates, the more critical estimates include
our accounting for the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets, recognition of contingent revenues,
amortization of deferred costs, equity incentive compensation, and income taxes. In particular, the accounting for
these areas is subject to uncertainty because it requires significant use of judgment to be made by management.
Different assumptions in the application of these policies could result in material changes in our consolidated
balance sheets or consolidated statements of operations.

**_Contingent Revenues_**

We generate contingent revenues from contracts with insurance carriers for which we are compensated for
certain growth, profitability, or other performance-based metrics. These amounts are variable and in excess of
commission and fee revenues. Not all policies placed with participating insurance carriers are eligible for contingent
revenues. Our performance obligation of achieving these metrics is satisfied over time, and revenue is therefore
recognized over time using a time-based measure of progress.

Accordingly, we estimate the amount of consideration that will be received, such that a significant reversal
of revenue is not probable. Estimates are determined each period on a contract-by-contract or carrier-by-carrier
basis, where available. In certain cases, it is impractical to assess a very large number of smaller contingent revenue
contracts, so we use a historical portfolio estimate in aggregate. Because the expectation of the contingent revenue
amounts to be earned can vary from period to period, especially in contracts sensitive to loss ratios, the estimates
might change significantly from quarter to quarter. Variable consideration is recognized when we conclude, based
on all the facts and information available at the reporting date, that it is probable that a significant revenue reversal
will not occur in future periods.

For more information, refer to Note 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 4. Revenue
Recognition to the consolidated financial statements that are included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

_Judgments and Uncertainties_

Because our expectation of the ultimate contingent revenue amounts to be earned can vary from period to
period, especially in contracts sensitive to loss ratios, our estimates might change significantly from quarter to
quarter. For example, in circumstances where our revenues are dependent on a full calendar year loss ratio, adverse
loss experience in the fourth quarter could not only negate revenue earnings in the fourth quarter, but also trigger the
need to reverse revenues previously recognized during the prior quarters. Variable consideration is recognized when
we conclude, based on all the facts and information available at the reporting date, that it is probable that a
significant revenue reversal will not occur in future periods.

_Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions_

We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or
assumptions used to recognize revenue. As noted above, estimates are made based on historical experience and
other factors. The vast majority of our contracts are for a period of one year or less, and historically, the difference
between actual experience compared to estimated performance has not been significant to the annual financial
statements.

**_Goodwill and Amortizable Intangible Assets_**

Goodwill is evaluated for impairment by first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether a
quantitative goodwill test is necessary. If it is determined, based on qualitative factors, that it is more likely than not
that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or if significant changes to macro-economic
factors related to the reporting unit have occurred that could materially impact fair value, a quantitative goodwill
impairment test would be required. The quantitative test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying
amount. Additionally, we can elect to forgo the qualitative assessment and perform the quantitative test. Upon
performing the quantitative test, if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss
is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. We have elected to


-----

make the first day of the fourth quarter the annual impairment assessment date for goodwill. However, we could be
required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill outside of the required annual assessment if, among other things,
we experience disruptions to the business, unexpected significant declines in operating results, divestiture of a
significant component of the business or a sustained decline in market capitalization.

We acquire intangible assets either individually or as part of a group of assets. We record intangible assets
at fair value upon acquisition. In determining the fair value at the time of recognition, we primarily consider the
present value of the underlying net cash flows expected to be generated by the corresponding asset or group of assets
discounted at a market rate of interest. The determinations of fair value are based on estimates and assumptions
related to the amount and timing of future cash flows and future interest rates. Such estimates and assumptions could
change in the future as more information becomes known, which could impact the amounts reported and disclosed
herein.

For more information, refer to Note 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Note 6. Goodwill, and
Note 7. Amortizable Intangible Assets to the consolidated financial statements that are included elsewhere in this
offering memorandum.

_Judgments and Uncertainties_

We estimate the fair value of our reporting units using both the income approach (discounted cash flow
method) and the market approach (guideline public company method), which use significant unobservable inputs.
We include assumptions about revenue growth, operating margins, discount rates and valuation multiples which
consider our business plans and economic projections, and are believed to reflect market participant views which
would exist in an exit transaction. Our goodwill impairment analysis contains uncertainties due to uncontrollable
events that could positively or negatively impact the anticipated future economic and operating conditions.

We apply judgment in determining the various assumptions used to estimate the fair value of our intangible
assets, including useful lives and intended use of assets, observable market valuations, forecasted revenue growth,
operating margins and discount rates based on budgets, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash
flows and marketplace data that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows.

_Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions_

Some of the inherent estimates and assumptions used in determining fair value of our reporting units are
outside the control of management, including interest rates, cost of capital, tax rates, market EBITDA comparables
and credit ratings. While we believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to compute the fair value
of the reporting units, a material change may still occur, which could result in material impairments of our goodwill
if our actual results do not align with our estimations. While we do not anticipate any material changes in the factors
used to calculate the fair value or useful lives of amortizable intangible assets, if actual results are not consistent
with our estimates and assumptions used to calculate estimate future cash flows, we may be exposed to impairment
losses that could be material.

**_Deferred Costs_**

We incur costs to provide policy placement and other services. Those costs are either (i) costs to obtain a
contract, (ii) costs to fulfill a contract, or (iii) all other costs.

We defer certain costs to obtain customer contracts, primarily incremental commissions paid to internal
producers on new business. These incremental costs are deferred and amortized over a 15-year period. For all other
incremental costs incurred to obtain customer contracts, we recognize the incremental costs of obtaining contracts as
an expense when incurred, as the amortization period of the assets that otherwise would have been recognized is one
year or less.

We incur costs to fulfill a contract (or anticipated contract) with a customer that are expected to be
recovered in the future. These costs relate to compensation and benefits of internal producers and related support


-----

staff who perform policy placement services, and are incurred prior to the effective date of the underlying policy.
Deferrable costs to fulfill relate to fulfillment activities, which include collecting underwriting information from
insureds or agents of the insureds, assessing their insurance needs and negotiating their placement with one or more
insurance carriers, and underwriting their risk. Deferrable costs to fulfill incurred prior to the policy effective date
are capitalized and expensed on the policy effective date.

Other costs that are not costs to obtain or fulfill are expensed as incurred. Examples include other operating
costs such as rent, utilities, management costs, overhead costs, legal and other professional fees, technology costs,
insurance related costs, communication and advertising, and travel and entertainment. Depreciation and amortization
are expensed over the useful lives of the underlying assets.

For more information, refer to Note 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 4. Revenue
Recognition to the consolidated financial statements that are included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

_Judgments and Uncertainties_

Deferred costs contain uncertainties due to judgment in assumptions, including the period for which the
deferred costs are amortized and the costs subject to deferral. Specifically, costs associated with obtaining the
contract are amortized over a period of 15 years whereas the costs associated with fulfilling the contract are
amortized over a period of 1-3 months.

_Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions_

We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or
assumptions used to calculate deferred costs. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and
assumptions used to determine the amortization period and costs subject to deferral, we may be exposed to an
increase or decrease in deferred costs that could be material.

**_Equity Incentive Compensation_**

Our employees have historically participated in TFC’s equity incentive plans (the “TFC Plans”) that
provide for the grant of Restricted Stock Awards (“RSAs”), Restricted Stock Units, (“RSUs”) and Performance
Share Units (“PSUs”). In addition, during 2022, TFC adopted an employee stock purchase plan (the “ESPP”).
Compensation cost has been allocated to the Company based on the awards and terms previously granted to TIH
employees. We determine compensation cost associated with RSUs and PSUs based on the fair value of underlying
TFC common stock on the date of grant less the present value of expected dividends that will be forgone during the
vesting period. Compensation cost for RSAs and RSUs is generally recognized over the vesting period taking into
account retirement eligibility. Forfeitures are recognized when they occur. For PSUs, compensation cost is
recognized over the vesting period after considering the number of awards expected to vest based on the estimated
probability of achieving the associated performance targets.

On April 3, 2023, we adopted several equity incentive plans (referred to collectively as the “TIH Plans”)
pursuant to which we may issue phantom equity units, phantom profits interests and profits interests to TIH
employees and other service providers. The terms of such awards are further described in Note 13. Equity Incentive
Compensation to the consolidated financial statements that are included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.
Compensation cost for awards with solely time-based vesting conditions is recognized over the applicable requisite
service period using the graded vesting method, taking into account accelerated vesting provisions for retirementeligible employees (applicable to the phantom equity units only). The phantom profits interests and certain of the
profits interests contain event-based vesting conditions tied to a liquidity event. Qualifying liquidity events as
defined in the TIH plans include a (i) ‘Change of Control’ as a result of any single transaction or series of related
transactions pursuant to which a different entity holds a majority of the Company’s voting power thereafter and (ii)
an ‘Initial Public Offering’, including a transaction whereby the Company’s equity securities are exchanged or
otherwise converted into securities that are publicly listed. To vest in the awards, recipients must remain employed
at the time of the qualifying liquidity event. Additionally, based on the timing of the qualifying liquidity event, the


-----

phantom profits interests and profits interests with event-based vesting conditions contain a post-transaction service
requirement. Forfeitures on all awards are recorded when they occur.

_Judgments and Uncertainties_

Our equity incentive compensation contains uncertainties due to judgment in assumptions, including (i) the
estimated probability of achieving performance targets, (ii) inputs to determine the total equity value of TIH used to
value the phantom equity units, and (iii) inputs to the Black-Scholes option pricing model used to value the phantom
profits interests and profits interests.

The fair value of the phantom equity units is determined based on the value of the underlying TIH common
units (refer to the stock price input below, which describes how the fair value of TIH common units was determined)
considering a discount for lack of marketability.

The fair value of the Profits Interests is measured on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing
model and is not remeasured. Refer to the notes to the consolidated financial statements that are included elsewhere
in this offering memorandum for further information regarding the inputs used to value the phantom profits interests
and profits interests (time-vested and event-vested), for grants issued during the year ended December 31, 2023.

_Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions_

We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or
assumptions used to calculate compensation cost related to equity incentive compensation. However, if actual results
are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used to calculate fair value, the amount of compensation cost
related to equity incentive compensation may materially differ.

**_Income Taxes_**

We estimate total income tax expense based on statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available
to us in various jurisdictions in which we earn income. Income tax includes an estimate for withholding taxes on
earnings of foreign subsidiaries expected to be remitted to the United States. Deferred income taxes are recognized
for the future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in
effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. We record unrecognized tax benefit liabilities
for known or anticipated tax issues based on our analysis of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will
be due.

As discussed in Note 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial
statements that are included elsewhere in this offering memorandum, as a result of the Partnership Conversion
during 2023, TIH is now predominantly composed of partnerships and disregarded entities held by other
partnerships. As such, for periods after the Partnership Conversion, federal income taxes will not be allocated to TIH
LLC, its subsidiary partnerships, or subsidiary disregarded entities.

For more information, refer to Note 11. Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements that are
included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

_Judgments and Uncertainties_

Our calculations related to income taxes contain uncertainties due to judgment used to calculate tax
liabilities in the application of complex tax regulations across the tax jurisdictions where we operate. Our analysis of
unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties based on judgment used to apply the more likely than not
recognition and measurement thresholds.

_Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions_


-----

Changes in tax laws and rates or the TIH organizational structure could affect recorded deferred tax assets
and liabilities in the future. Other than those potential impacts, we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood
there will be a material change to tax related balances. However, due to the complexity of some of these
uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the current estimate of
the tax liabilities.

**BUSINESS**

**Our Company**

We are one of the leading insurance brokers in the United States and provide a broad array of insurance
products and services (including P&C, employee benefits, life and title insurance) through our diversified
distribution channels (Retail, Wholesale, Specialty Programs and Title). Founded in 1922, we are the fifth largest
insurance broker in the United States by 2022 brokerage revenue and have strong market positions across the
insurance distribution chain. Our business is highly diversified across producers, clients, carriers and geographies,
and we serve corporations, small and medium-sized enterprises, and individuals through nearly 10,000 talented
employees. We have also demonstrated a robust growth trajectory throughout our history with approximately 5%
average annual organic revenue growth over the last 10 years and approximately 8% average annual organic revenue
growth over the last three and five years. In 2023, we placed over $50 billion of premiums, resulting in total revenue
of $3,467 million, net income of $210 million, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA of $1,178 million and a Pro Forma
Adjusted EBITDA margin of 34.1%.

Our operations are comprised of robust capabilities across our Retail brokerage, Wholesale brokerage,
Specialty Programs and Title businesses. Through our businesses we deliver end-to-end coverage across the
insurance distribution chain, making us well positioned to serve our clients. We have an insurance distribution
business model and do not retain any underwriting risk on our balance sheet. Each of our business units is described
in further detail below.

**_Retail Brokerage (36% of Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue in 2023)_**

Through our Retail brokerage business, we maintain primary relationships with clients who seek to
purchase insurance. We serve a wide range of clients, including large multinational corporations, small- and
medium-sized enterprises and individual consumers. We assist our clients by placing diverse insurance coverages
through our network of admitted carriers as well as through wholesalers, MGAs and MGUs for complex and
specialized insurance risks. MGAs and MGUs perform similar roles, generally known in the insurance industry and
will hereinafter be collectively referred to as “MGA”.

Our Retail brokerage operations are organized under the McGriff Insurance brand. McGriff Insurance is a
leading retail agency with an operating history spanning over 100 years. Through McGriff Insurance, we have a
scaled business that operates in all 50 states with over 3,500 employees, over 90 offices and a sizeable presence in
the mid-Atlantic and Southeast regions of the United States. We believe that our network of approximately 700
producers provides the basis for deep, embedded local relationships and “trusted advisor” status with our clients.

McGriff Insurance’s brokerage services encompass commercial lines, employee benefits and personal lines.
Commercial lines represented 71% of McGriff Insurance’s Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue in 2023. Commercial lines
are offered nationally with a focus on upper middle market and large clients, and feature strong specialty practices in
aviation, construction, energy & marine, executive risk, private equity, real estate & hospitality, surety,
transportation and senior living. Employee benefits represented 22% of McGriff Insurance’s Pro Forma Adjusted
Revenue in 2023. McGriff Insurance offers a full suite of employee benefits consulting and brokerage capabilities,
serving over 10,000 clients nationally. Personal lines represented 7% of McGriff Insurance’s Pro Forma Adjusted
Revenue in 2023. McGriff Insurance’s personal line offerings provide insurance and financial planning solutions to
mass-affluent and high net worth individuals nationally.

Our Retail brokerage business placed approximately $13 billion of premiums in 2023, resulting in $1,217
million, or 36%, of Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue in 2023 and an 8% Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue CAGR from
2021 to 2023. Organic revenue growth in our Retail brokerage business was approximately 9% in 2023, reflecting
strong underlying drivers, which include approximately 94% revenue retention, approximately 88% producer
retention and 78 gross producer hires in 2023.


-----

**_Wholesale Brokerage (46% of Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue in 2023)_**

We are a leading distributor of specialty insurance products and services through our Wholesale brokerage
business. Our extensive knowledge of the specialty insurance market allows us to act as an intermediary on behalf of
retail producers, assisting in the delivery of cost-effective coverage solutions for complex, specialized risks. With
4,400 employees as of December 31, 2023, our Wholesale brokerage business has extensive expertise across a wide
range of industries to facilitate placement of P&C coverages, as well as life, retirement and benefits products. In
2023, our Wholesale brokerage business placed over $36 billion of premiums and generated $1,568 million, or 46%,
of Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue during 2023, which resulted in a 9% Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue CAGR from
2021 to 2023.

Our Wholesale brokerage business is structured into two divisions: CRC and LRB. CRC represented 78%
of our Wholesale brokerage Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue in 2023, and LRB represented the remaining 22% of Pro
Forma Adjusted Revenue.

Through CRC, we are the third largest P&C wholesale broker in the United States by 2022 premium
volume, placing approximately $13 billion of premiums in 2023. CRC is a leading provider of specialty brokerage
services across property, casualty and professional lines of business. Through our affiliated CRC Binding and Tapco
brands, we also offer direct access to open-brokerage capabilities, in-house binding facilities and MGA facilities for
numerous commercial insurance classes and lines of coverage. CRC had an 11% revenue CAGR from 2021 to 2023.

CRC maintains extensive relationships with retail producers and insurance carriers through a national
network of 750 producers sitting across nearly 100 offices. Our size, scale and strong relationships within the
insurance marketplace enhance our ability to provide customers with comprehensive access to these markets. We
also leverage our product expertise, relationships with carriers and proprietary data to structure new insurance
programs and products to respond to opportunities in the marketplace. Via our Insurisk brand, we leverage data
collected from CRC’s business to provide 15 exclusive products to CRC producers. We also maintain a proprietary
data and analytics platform called REDY that harnesses millions of data points on wholesale products, spanning
dozens of coverages and thousands of industries, to deliver valuable and actional intelligence to our producers and
provide a distinct competitive advantage in the marketplace.

LRB is comprised of two leading brands in the life, retirement and benefits space. Crump is a leading thirdparty distributor and service provider of life insurance retirement products in the United States, while BenefitMall is
a leading wholesale employee benefits platform.

**_Specialty Programs (15% of Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue in 2023)_**

We operate a variety of specialty insurance programs wherein insurance carriers have authorized us to
perform certain functions on their behalf – including underwriting, pricing, and binding – for designated risks. Our
authority to perform these functions is usually subject to underwriting guidelines, policy limits and pricing
parameters that are developed jointly with our carrier partners and are specific to each program.

When our subsidiaries and programs serve as an MGA, we generally act as an intermediary between retail
and wholesale brokers who request insurance coverages and carriers who provide balance sheet capacity. If we are
able to bind coverages, we issue policies on behalf of the insurance carriers we represent. Because we operate on
behalf of the insurance carriers, our programs do not take underwriting risk for the policies we bind.

Our Specialty Programs business is one of the largest MGA platforms in the United States by 2022
premium volume with $5.4 billion of premiums written in 2023 spread across more than 40 programs. We have a
highly diversified business mix comprised of 46% property, 10% construction, 10% transportation, 9% reinsurance,
9% professional lines, 6% marine and energy, 4% real estate and 6% other lines for 2023 premiums. In 2023, our
Specialty Programs business generated $505 million, or 15%, of Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue. Our Specialty
Programs business had an approximate 8% Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue CAGR from 2021 to 2023, excluding the
recently acquired Wellington (which is housed within AmRisc ). As of December 31, 2023, over 760 employees
were part of the Specialty Programs business.


-----

Our Specialty Programs division operates through two divisions: AmRisc and Starwind. During 2023,
AmRisc generated $262 million of Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue, of which $27 million was contributed by
Wellington (which is housed within AmRisc), and Starwind generated $216 million of Pro Forma Adjusted
Revenue.

AmRisc is one of the largest property catastrophe MGAs in the United States with $2.6 billion of total
premiums written during 2023. Of these premiums, approximately $2.3 billion are allocated to commercial lines.
Commercial lines are offered by AmRisc and its related brands, which include Chronos Retail, Waypoint
Wholesale, and AmRisc Online. The remaining $264 million of AmRisc’s premiums are allocated to admitted
personal lines, which are offered under the Wellington brand. Wellington was acquired by AmRisc in 2021 and is
focused on providing coverages for the Texas homeowners’ market. AmRisc has a strong track record of
underwriting profitability and, together with Wellington, employed over 140 specialist underwriters as of December
31, 2023. AmRisc posted a 7% CAGR for commissions and fees between 2021 and 2023, excluding Wellington.

Starwind is a leading casualty-focused specialty program manager focused on underwriting and distributing
complex insurance solutions through dozens of specialized MGAs. Starwind provides specialty products across
multiple industries with a full suite of services comprising underwriting, distribution and claims management. As of
December 31, 2023, over 30 insurance brands were managed by Starwind, including Prime Specialty and Venture
Underwriters for contractor general liability and excess liability, Continental Underwriters for tailored marine,
inland marine, excess liability and cargo, Norman-Spencer for real estate professional and wholesale brokerage,
Aspen Insurance for personal auto and personal property, Allstar Transportation Specialists for E&S trucking,
Coastal Insurance Underwriters for homeowners and condominium associations as well as golf and country clubs,
and Allstar Underwriters for commercial auto, homeowners and commercial property. Starwind posted a 12% Pro
Forma Adjusted Revenue CAGR between 2021 and 2023.

**_Title (3% of Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue in 2023)_**

Our Title business operates through Kensington Vanguard National Land Services, an independent
commercial title agency in the United States. Kensington Vanguard National Land Services serves as an agent to the
nation’s largest title insurance underwriters, providing commercial and residential title insurance as well as other
related services. In 2023, our Title business generated $92 million of Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue, or 3%, of Pro
Forma Adjusted Revenue.

**Our Industry**

We operate our business within the U.S. insurance brokerage industry. We primarily compete for business
on the basis of reputation, relationships, client service, expertise, product offerings, and the ability to tailor our
products and risk management services to meet the needs of clients. Through our Retail brokerage business, we
compete with a number of insurance brokerage firms that focus on delivering services to Fortune 1000 and mediumsized companies, including large publicly traded brokers (such as Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc., Aon plc,
Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company, Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. and Brown & Brown, Inc.), large
privately held brokerage businesses and other small locally-owned agencies. Through our Wholesale brokerage
business, we compete with a number of other wholesale brokerage firms such as Ryan Specialty Holdings, Inc.
(publicly traded), Amwins Group, Inc. (privately held) and others, as well as retail brokerage firms that distribute
products similar to the types of products we distribute and insurance carriers that distribute these products directly
through retail producers. Through our Specialty Programs business, we compete with a variety of sources for
standard and specialized insurance products with similar coverages. In many cases, our competitors are MGAs,
wholesale brokerage firms and insurance carriers.

**_P&C Insurance Brokerage Market_**

P&C insurance in the United States is sold by two types of insurance carriers: those that are admitted and
those that are non-admitted. Admitted carriers typically sell standard insurance products for which insurance rates
and risk coverages are relatively uniform and must comply with applicable laws and, in certain states, regulatory
approval. Non-admitted carriers typically engage in the E&S lines market, taking on relatively specialized and
complex risks that do not fit the underwriting criteria of standard insurance products.


-----

Through the scope of our business activities as an insurance broker, we provide products and services to
both the admitted and non-admitted insurance markets. Insurance brokers act as intermediaries between insureds and
insurance carriers. Retail producers place P&C insurance coverages on behalf of businesses, public institutions and
individual clients, negotiating with carriers for competitive rates and policy terms. Retail producers are typically
compensated through commissions paid by carriers on the premium that is placed; however, they can also be paid on
a fee basis for their insurance placement and other risk consultation services. Wholesale insurance brokers act as
intermediaries between insurance carriers and retail producers by assisting retail producers in placing business that is
outside of their core expertise or ability to place directly. Wholesale insurance brokers often provide retail insurance
brokers with specialty and E&S insurance products. Wholesale brokers are typically compensated by commissions
paid by the insurance carrier, although they can also receive fees in addition to commissions for placing certain
insurance policies. In some cases, brokers can act as an MGA for insurance carriers. An MGA generally has
authority to bind coverage on behalf of an insurance carrier for a specific type of risk, subject to agreed-upon
guidelines and limits. An MGA generally does not assume underwriting risk for the products that it distributes.

Historically, despite economic ebbs and flows, the P&C insurance sector has demonstrated resilient and
stable growth. Total U.S. P&C direct written premiums increased each year between 1996 and 2023 (except during
the 2008 global financial crisis), resulting in a 4.4% CAGR from 1996 to 2022. P&C premium growth tends to be
less volatile than changes in insurance rates, which can fluctuate during soft and hard markets. During periods of
declining premium rates (known as soft markets), insureds tend to increase limits on coverages, purchase new
coverages and reduce deductibles. Conversely, during periods of increasing premium rates (known as hard markets),
insureds typically lower coverages and maintain higher deductibles. Combined with overall economic growth, these
dynamics have led to stable growth in P&C premiums over time.

The P&C insurance brokerage market has seen a large amount of consolidation activity over the last decade
as the industry shifts from a high degree of fragmentation to one where scaled, national platforms command a
growing share of the market. However, despite substantial consolidation, more than 40,000 independent brokerage
agencies were operating in the United States in 2022, an increase from 36,000 in 2020. We believe that this provides
a stable basis for ongoing M&A activity in the sector.

**_Employee Benefits Market_**

Employee benefits brokers and consultants primarily cater to companies and their employees by offering a
suite of health-related insurance products, including medical, life and disability coverages, as well as overseeing
retirement and asset management programs. These experts act both as intermediaries and strategic planners, offering
guidance on structuring benefit plans. As all-in-one solution providers, they enable middle-market businesses to
outsource the complexities of benefits planning, oversight and administration, thus allowing these businesses to
bypass the need for extensive internal infrastructure or significant investments in technology.

Demand for employee benefits offerings is largely driven by overall employment levels. The primary driver
of pricing for these products and services is healthcare spending. The design and execution of employee benefit
strategies have become increasingly nuanced, especially against the backdrop of ongoing healthcare inflation and
increased regulatory complexity. This evolving landscape underscores the growing relevance of adept benefits
brokers with strong service offerings and expertise.

**Our Strengths**

**_Scaled Platform with Market Leading Positions Across the Insurance Distribution Chain_**

We are the fifth largest insurance broker in the United States by 2022 brokerage revenue with over $50
billion in premium volume and approximately $3.5 billion of revenue in 2023. We believe that our reputation, built
through more than 100 years of operating history, as well as our size and scale grant us a distinct advantage in the
marketplace, enabling us to better assist our clients while deepening our engagement with insurance carriers. As we
continue to pursue our goals of increasing both our market share with clients and the depth of our relationships with
insurance carriers, we expect to further enhance our value proposition by providing heightened access to both
constituents. We believe we provide such enhanced access through a network of more than 2,000 producers and over


-----

450 underwriters based in over 200 locations across the United States as of December 31, 2023. We also maintain
over 40,000 wholesale agent relationships as of December 31, 2023.

We have robust capabilities across the insurance distribution chain, which we believe make us well
positioned to better serve our clients while capturing a greater proportion of commission revenues. Our key brands
include McGriff Insurance (a top 15 retail broker by 2022 brokerage revenue), CRC (a top 3 P&C wholesale broker
by 2022 premium volume), AmRisc (a leading property catastrophe MGA), Starwind (a leading program manager),
Crump (a leading life wholesaler), BenefitMall (a leading employee benefits wholesaler) and Kensington Vanguard
(an independent commercial title agency). Through these brands, we are the fifth largest broker in the United States
by 2022 brokerage revenue, the largest multiline wholesale broker in the United States by 2022 premium volume
and one of the largest MGA programs in the United States by 2022 premium volume.

**_Highly Diversified Business Model_**

Our revenue base is highly diversified across distribution channels, lines of business, geographies, clients,
end markets, producers and carriers, among other factors. Our diversification ensures limited reliance on any
particular product, distribution channel, customer, or market, reducing our exposure to any adverse industry
developments and macroeconomic factors and thereby mitigating volatility in our overall financial performance. In
addition, the breadth of our offerings provides us with various avenues through which we can identify gaps in the
market and develop specialized products to capture unmet demand.

1) P&C represents CRC, Specialty Programs and McGriff Insurance (excluding employee benefits). Employee benefits represents McGriff
Insurance’s employee benefits business and BenefitMall. Life represents Crump. Title represents Kensington Vanguard.
2) Top 30 rankings exclude Lloyd’s market.

Given the diversification of our business model, we are well positioned to channel premiums across several
distribution channels in situations that would benefit our clients. Ultimately, this enables us to better serve our
clients by providing enhanced coverage and placement for their risks while also allowing us to capture a greater
proportion of economics from the value chain. In 2023, McGriff Insurance placed approximately $1 billion of
premiums into CRC, 8% of CRC’s total premium. In the same year, McGriff Insurance placed approximately $54
million of premiums into Starwind, 2% of Starwind’s total premium. Similarly, CRC placed approximately $580
million of premiums with AmRisc, 23% of Amrisc’s total premium, and approximately $280 million of premiums
with Starwind, 9% of Starwind’s total premium.


-----

**_Long-Term Track Record of Growth with Continued Secular Tailwinds_**

We have a long-term track record of consistent growth. Over the last 19 years, we have demonstrated a
robust growth trajectory with a 9.5% total revenue CAGR and 4.2% average annual organic growth.

We have a demonstrated track record of growing organically across P&C and economic market cycles. Our
average organic revenue growth was 8%, 8% and 5% over the last 3, 5 and 10 years, respectively. We benefit from
the non-discretionary nature of insurance coverage and employee benefits, which we believe creates relatively
stable, consistent demand for our offerings across P&C and economic market cycles. We also believe we benefit
from distinct advantages in the marketplace driven by our longstanding reputation, scale, depth of relationships,
client service, expertise, and product offerings.

_____________

1) Based on P&C direct premiums written.
2) Based on annual average commercial P&C rate changes.

We believe that our organic revenue growth compares favorably to large, publicly traded insurance brokers
with whom we compete (such as Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc., Aon plc, Willis Towers Watson Public
Limited Company, Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. and Brown & Brown, Inc.). Since 2018, we have generated higher


-----

annual organic revenue growth compared to the median of large, publicly traded peer brokerage segments. Our
average annual organic revenue growth between 2018 and 2023 was 7.3%, including our Title and Wellington
businesses, and 7.8% excluding these businesses. This compares favorably to a public peer composite average of
6.8%. We believe that our outperformance is driven by our diversified business model and strong growth across our
wholesale P&C and MGA businesses.

_____________

1) Represents TIH organic revenue growth excluding the Title and Wellington businesses.
2) Represents the median organic revenue growth for the brokerage segments of Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc., Aon plc, Willis
Towers Watson Public Limited Company, Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. and Brown & Brown, Inc. per public filings.

We believe that a combination of secular tailwinds, in addition to our identified growth initiatives, will help
to sustain our strong organic growth trajectory.

_Market Share Growth for E&S Lines and MGAs. Insurance risks are becoming increasingly complex and_
specialized given the impacts of globalization and technological change, among other factors. As a result, E&S lines
are becoming more prevalent in the United States, resulting in higher market share. In 2022, $98 billion of direct
premiums written were in E&S lines, representing 11% of P&C premiums in the United States. This is nearly double
the $45 billion of E&S direct written premiums in 2017, which comprised 7% of P&C premiums at the time.
Similarly, utilization of MGAs is increasing as a means of efficiently underwriting and placing complex risks. Direct
written premiums channeled through MGAs in the United States grew from $43 billion in 2017 to $86 billion in
2022, reflecting a growth in market share from 7% to 10% of total P&C premiums. We believe these trends have
generated a sustained tailwind for our organic growth given the weighting of our product mix and distribution
channels.

_P&C Pricing Environment. The P&C sector is currently characterized by a hard market with a general_
upward trend in pricing. The average premium rate change for commercial P&C products was 10.6% in 2020, 9.0%
in 2021, 7.5% in 2022 and 8.4% in 2023. We believe uplifts in pricing for the coverages we sell generate favorable
impacts on our organic growth.

_Broker Commission Rates. Broker commission rates have gradually increased over time and have_
demonstrated resilience amid the current hard market environment, reflecting the strong value proposition delivered
by brokerage firms to clients and carriers. Direct commission rates for commercial P&C lines were 13.3% in 2019,
13.2% in 2020, 13.4% in 2021 and 13.6% in 2022, which compared favorably to 12.1% in 2011. We believe higher
brokerage commission rates create a tailwind for our organic growth.

In addition to strong organic growth, our growth has also been propelled historically by acquiring and
developing key capabilities that have enhanced the scale of our platform and the depth and breadth of our offerings.


-----

**_Strong Financial Performance and Recurring Free Cash Flow Generation_**

We have a sustained track record of delivering strong growth in total revenue and Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA. Our Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA margin was 34.1% in 2023. Combined with limited capital
expenditures, working capital requirements and cash tax obligations, we believe we are able to generate highly
visible cash flows that can be used to drive organic growth, fund highly accretive acquisitions and repay debt. Our
Free Cash Flow as a percentage of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA was 97.5% in 2021, 98.1% in 2022 and 91.3% in
2023.

**_Seasoned, Aligned Management Team_**

We have a high-quality management team led by John Howard (Chairman and CEO) and Dave Obenauer
(Vice Chairman and President), supported by a deep bench of industry veterans averaging more than 25 years of
experience. In addition, we expect to benefit from the significant knowledge and experience of our Sponsors. We are
committed to maintaining strong alignment throughout our organization by providing meaningful equity ownership
across the management team and our top 1,500 producers and employees.

**Our Strategies**

**_Continued Execution of Organic Growth Initiatives_**

We are highly focused on driving organic growth across our business. Key components of our organic
growth strategy include: (1) enhanced cross-sell to existing clients across all of our operations, (2) development of
new programs and products given opportunities in the marketplace, and (3) producer recruitment and retention.

We have a long and successful track record of attracting and retaining producer talent. Since January 2019,
we have hired over 360 producers at McGriff Insurance and over 270 brokers at CRC. The McGriff Insurance
producer hires generated $103 million of revenue in 2023, representing approximately 9% of McGriff Insurance’s
total commissions and fees during 2023. The CRC broker hires generated $128 million of revenue in 2023,
representing 10.7% of CRC’s total commissions and fees during 2023. Producer recruiting activity remained strong
in 2023 following Stone Point’s minority investment and implementation of the new TIH equity incentive plan.
Voluntary producer attrition has improved as well since the initial equity investment by Stone Point. We believe we
have a significant opportunity to accelerate producer recruiting by leveraging our new equity incentive plan and
additional investment in recruiting personnel and programs.

**_Disciplined Acquisition Strategy_**

We believe that we can enhance the strength and diversification of our platform by acquiring new
capabilities and entering new regional markets. As such, we engage in discussions with potential acquisition targets
on an ongoing basis. To successfully execute our acquisition strategy, we have developed a disciplined approach to
evaluating and integrating acquisitions. An acquisition candidate must meet a number of financial and non-financial
criteria to be considered a viable candidate. We target acquisitions that we believe will add to the strength of our
platform while having the potential to generate strong financial performance in the future.

**_Foster an Equity Culture_**

We instituted a new equity incentive plan and a co-investment program in conjunction with Stone Point’s
initial equity investment in April 2023. Both programs have served to enhance alignment across our organization
and drive higher producer retention and recruitment. As of December 31, 2023, over 1,500 of our employees and
producers participate in our equity incentive plan and approximately 90 key leaders and producers have invested
meaningful equity amounts alongside Stone Point through our co-investment program. In connection with the
Transactions, we expect to implement an expanded equity incentive plan and co-investment program to drive further
alignment and equity ownership across the producer base. Management will also be rolling a significant portion of
their proceeds as part of the Rollover.


-----

**_Enhance Operational Efficiency and Profitability_**

We have a track record of managing operating expenses effectively and driving continuous margin
improvement over time. In 2023, we initiated a series of expense and efficiency initiatives to streamline our
operations and increase operating leverage without impacting revenue. As of December 31, 2023, we have identified
$96 million of expense reductions. Of this amount, $61 million of reductions have been actioned in 2023 (or are
scheduled to be actioned in the first quarter of 2024) and $7 million have been realized in 2023. Key cost saving
categories include: (1) targeted reductions in force of duplicative leadership and unprofitable producers across all
business units, (2) rationalization of real estate footprint and consolidation of overlapping offices, (3) tightened
oversight of travel and entertainment spend, and (4) third party vendor contract optimization. Viewing the $96
million of expected expense reductions holistically, 53% relates to organizational restructuring, 21% relates to
additional outsourcing, 3% relates to real estate rationalization and 23% relates to other initiatives. Additionally, we
have identified an incremental $28 million of potential expense reductions, which we expect to action in 2024,
including $20 million in possible savings from outsourcing or offshoring non-client facing functions, $3 million of
expected additional real estate rationalization savings and approximately $5 million of potential information
technology savings. We believe there is a significant opportunity to improve profitability and drive efficiencies as a
standalone entity that does not operate as a subsidiary of a bank.

**Insurance Carriers**

We maintain relationships with all major insurance carriers and have established relationships with major
insurance and reinsurance companies, as well as with carriers in Canada. We are able to secure attractive terms from
our insurance carriers on behalf of our clients because of our expertise, the established relationships that many of our
producers have with these carriers and the amount of business that we are able to deliver. We also have in-house
staff with underwriting expertise in several specialty programs, which helps insurance carriers to evaluate risks.

We are diversified from an insurance carrier standpoint. In 2023, our top 10 carriers accounted for
approximately 20% of our premium volume, with none accounting for more than 3.2%.

**Clients**

We serve a wide range of clients, including large multinational corporations, small-and medium-sized
enterprises and individual consumers. We are highly diversified from a client standpoint. As of December 31, 2023,
we served over 1 million commercial and individual clients nationwide.

**Regulation**

The manner in which we conduct our business is subject to legal requirements and governmental regulatory
supervision in the United States and in each state in which we operate. Although the scope of regulation and form of
supervision may vary from state to state, insurance laws are often complex and generally grant broad discretion to
supervisory authorities in adopting regulations and supervising regulated activities. These regulations are generally
designed to protect our clients by establishing minimum standards of conduct and practice, particularly regarding the
provision of advice and product information as well as the handling of client funds held in a fiduciary capacity.

_Licensing requirements. In each state in which we do business, the relevant insurance brokerage is required_
to be licensed or to have received regulatory approval to conduct business. In addition to brokerage licensing
requirements, most states in which we operate require individuals who engage in brokerage and certain insurance
service activities to be licensed personally.

Our operations depend on the validity of and continued good standing under the licenses and approvals
pursuant to which we operate. Licensing laws and regulations vary from state to state and are subject to amendment
or interpretation by regulatory authorities. Such authorities generally have the discretion to grant, renew or revoke
licenses and approvals for various reasons, including the violation of regulations. In some instances, where there is
uncertainty as to applicability, we follow practices based on our interpretations of regulations or practices that we
believe generally to be followed by the industry. These practices may turn out to be different from the interpretations of


-----

regulatory authorities. If we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable
regulatory requirements, state insurance regulators could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or
all of our activities in their state or could otherwise penalize us. This could adversely affect our ability to operate our
business.

_Disclosure requirements. In certain states, laws or regulations require enhanced disclosure to clients of_
contingent commission arrangements and other relationships that we may have with insurance carriers.

_Client information privacy. The management and dissemination of information is critical to our business. We_
maintain confidential, personal and proprietary information relating to our clients. This information includes
personally identifiable information, protected health information, and financial information. We are subject to data
privacy laws and regulations relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of this information.

_Regulation regarding client funds. The handling of client funds we hold in a fiduciary capacity are subject_
to extensive regulation and supervision by state authorities. Such funds appear on our balance sheet as “Fiduciary
cash” and we maintain such amounts in accounts segregated from our other cash and investment accounts. We
believe we have taken appropriate steps to uphold our fiduciary duties to our clients in respect of these funds.

**Competition**

The business of providing insurance products and services is highly competitive. We compete for
customers on the basis of reputation, client service, program and product offerings, and our ability to tailor products
and services to meet the specific needs of a customer. We actively compete with numerous integrated financial
services organizations as well as insurance companies and brokers, producer groups, individual insurance agents,
investment management firms, independent financial planners and broker-dealers, including participants, such as
Aon plc, Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc., Willis Towers Watson plc, Arthur J. Gallagher & Co., Brown &
Brown, Inc., AssuredPartners, Inc., Hub International Limited, USI, Inc., Amwins Group, Inc. and Ryan Specialty
LLC.

**Employees**

As of December 31, 2023, we had nearly 10,000 employees, over 2,000 of which were producers, in over
200 offices across the United States and Canada. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We
believe we have good relations with our employees.

**Facilities**

Our principal executive offices are located at 550 South Caldwell Street, 15th Floor, Charlotte, NC 28202.
As of December 31, 2023, we have over 200 offices across the United States and Canada. We believe that our
facilities are adequate for our present purposes.

**Systems and Technology**

Our approach to technology is focused on supporting the Company’s growth and innovation. We continue
to evolve our enterprise-class, integrated technology platform by investing in advanced third-party and proprietary
technology systems and infrastructure. This platform enables us to operate more efficiently and create new solutions
for clients.

System optimization through digital innovation, and improving the completeness and accuracy of data have
become recent priorities. We developed a data warehouse that is central to strategic data and technology initiatives. We
continue to evolve our proprietary web-based client portals, self-service technologies, automation tools, mobile
applications and analytics for clients. We also continue to focus on our cybersecurity program to ensure a strong
security posture. Our digital innovation initiatives drive increased efficiencies for both our employees and clients.


-----

**Legal Proceedings**

We have been subject to various claims, lawsuits and proceedings that arise in the normal course of
business. These matters principally consist of alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement of
insurance and the rendering of administrative or consulting services. The placement of insurance and the handling of
claims involve substantial amounts of money. Since errors and omissions claims against us may allege our potential
liability for all or part of the amounts in question, claimants may seek large damage awards and these claims can
involve significant defense costs. Errors and omissions could include, for example, our employees or sub-agents
failing, whether negligently or intentionally, to place coverage or to notify insurance carriers of claims on behalf of
clients, to provide insurance carriers with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured or to
appropriately apply funds that we hold for our clients on a fiduciary basis.

We are also subject to litigation in circumstances where we hire producers or senior managers who are
subject to confidentiality or non-solicitation agreements with our competitors. We have not recorded a liability
related to any of these matters, other than for legal costs, because management is unable at the present time to make
a determination that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable.

We are periodically involved in other threatened and actual claims and litigation arising out of the ordinary
course of business. Although we cannot be certain of the disposition of any claim or the outcome of any litigation,
nor the amount of damages and exposure that we could incur, we currently believe that the final disposition of such
matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash
flows.

For additional information on legal proceedings and related matters, see Note 15, “Commitments and
Contingencies,” in our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

-----

**DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN OTHER INDEBTEDNESS**

**Senior Credit Facilities**

On the Completion Date, the Company, as borrower (the “Borrower”), will enter into (i) a first lien credit

The Senior Credit Facilities provide for the First Lien Term Loan Facility in an aggregate principal amount
of $3,350 million, the Revolving Credit Facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1,175 million and the Second
Lien Term Loan Facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1,900 million.

The following is a summary description of certain terms of the Senior Credit Facilities.

of outstanding letters of credit plus a fronting fee to the issuing bank and (iii) administration fees.

**_Prepayments_**

The Credit Agreements contain certain mandatory prepayment provisions, including with respect to excess
cash flow (solely in the case of the First Lien Credit Facilities), asset sale proceeds and proceeds from certain
incurrences of indebtedness, which are subject to certain exceptions. No mandatory prepayments will be required
with respect to the Second Lien Credit Agreement until the First Lien Credit Facilities have been repaid in full.

**_Amortization and Maturity_**

Under the First Lien Credit Agreement, the Borrower will be required to make scheduled quarterly
payments on the First Lien Term Loan Facility in an annual amount equal to 1% of the initial outstanding balance of
the First Lien Term Loan Facility, with the balance of the First Lien Term Loan Facility to be due and payable on

and the Second Lien Secured Parties (as defined in the Second Lien Credit Agreement) in the collateral will be
subject to the Intercreditor Agreement (as defined in the First Lien Credit Agreement), which will provide that the
lien of the Second Lien Secured Parties in the collateral shall be subordinate to the lien of the First Lien Secured

Certain terms used in this description are defined under the subheading “Certain Definitions.” In this
description, (i) the term “Issuer” refers, prior to the Escrow Sub Merger (as defined below), to Panther Escrow
Issuer LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “Escrow Issuer”), and, from and after the Escrow Sub
Merger, to Truist Insurance Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“TIH”), and not any of their
Subsidiaries, (ii) the term “McGriff Insurance” refers to McGriff Insurance Services, LLC, a North Carolina limited
liability company, (iii) the term “Panther Co-Issuer” refers to Panther Co-Issuer, Inc., a Delaware corporation, (iv)
the term “Holdings” refers to Panther Platform Holdco, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, (v) the term
“ParentCo” refers to Panther Platform Midco, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, (vi) the term “Issuers” refers to,
prior to the Escrow Sub Merger, the Escrow Issuer and Panther Co-Issuer (the “Escrow Issuers”) and, from and after
the Escrow Sub Merger, TIH, McGriff Insurance and Panther Co-Issuer and (vii) the terms “we,” “our” and “us”
each refer to the Escrow Issuers before the completion of the Escrow Sub Merger and, from and after the completion
of the Escrow Sub Merger and the guarantee of the obligations under the Notes and the indenture by Holdings,
ParentCo and the Subsidiary Guarantors (as defined below), Holdings and its consolidated Subsidiaries. The
Indenture will provide that any action of the Issuers permitted or required by the Indenture may be taken by the
Issuer on behalf of the Issuers with the same effect as if the Issuers had collectively taken such action.

The Escrow Issuers will issue $2,750.0 million aggregate principal amount of       % senior secured
notes due 2031 (the “Notes”) under an indenture to be dated the Issue Date (the “Indenture”) among the Escrow
Issuers and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”) and as collateral agent (the
“Notes Collateral Agent”). On the Completion Date (as defined below), the Guarantors (as defined below) will also

will merge with and into TIH (the “Escrow Sub Merger”), with TIH continuing as the surviving entity and with TIH
and McGriff Insurance assuming the obligations of the Escrow Issuer, and McGriff Insurance will become a coobligor as an issuer, under the Notes and the Indenture pursuant to a supplemental indenture. On the Completion
Date, the Guarantors will also guarantee the Issuers’ obligations under the Indenture and the Notes. The Escrow
Agreement referred to below under the caption “Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption” will govern
the terms of the escrow of the gross proceeds from this offering pending consummation of the Acquisition.

The Notes will be issued in a private transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements of the
Securities Act. See “Notice to Investors.” Except as set forth herein, the terms of the Notes will be substantially
identical and include those expressly stated in the Indenture. Holders of the Notes will not be entitled to any
registration rights, so the Indenture will not be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act. See “Transfer Restrictions”
elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

The following description is only a summary of the material provisions of the Notes Documents, does not
purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the provisions of the Notes Documents,
including the definitions therein of certain terms used below. We urge you to read the Notes Documents because
they, not this description, define your rights as Holders of the Notes. You may request copies of the Indenture at our
address set forth under the heading “Summary—Corporate Information.”

**Brief Description of the Notes**

The Notes will be:

    - senior secured obligations of the Issuers;

    - _pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future Senior Indebtedness (including the Senior_
Credit Facilities) of the Issuers;


-----

    - prior to the Completion Date, secured on a first-priority basis by the Escrowed Property held in the
Escrow Account and, from and after the Completion Date, secured on a first-priority basis by the
Collateral, subject to certain Liens permitted under the Indenture;

    - equal in priority as to the Collateral with respect to the First Lien Credit Facilities Obligations and the
Other Pari Passu Lien Obligations (if any) incurred after the Issue Date;

    - senior in right of payment to any future subordinated indebtedness of the Issuers;

    - from and after the Completion Date, unconditionally guaranteed on a senior secured basis, jointly and
severally, by each Guarantor;

    - effectively senior to all existing and future unsecured Indebtedness and junior lien Indebtedness of the
Issuer, including the Second Lien Credit Facility, to the extent of the value of the Collateral;

    - effectively subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness of the Issuers that is secured by Liens
on assets that do not constitute a part of the Collateral to the extent of the value of such assets; and

    - structurally subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness and other liabilities, including
preferred stock, of any Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries.

Each Guarantee (as defined below) will be, following the Completion Date:

    - a senior secured obligation of the applicable Guarantor;

    - _pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future senior Indebtedness of that Guarantor,_
including its guarantee of the Senior Credit Facilities;

    - secured on a first-priority basis by the Collateral owned by that Guarantor, subject to certain Liens
permitted under the Indenture;

    - equal in priority as to the Collateral owned by that Guarantor with respect to the First Lien Credit
Facilities Obligations and the Other Pari Passu Lien Obligations of that Guarantor (if any) incurred
after the Completion Date;

    - senior in right of payment to all future subordinated indebtedness of that Guarantor;

    - effectively senior to all existing and future unsecured Indebtedness and junior lien Indebtedness of that
Guarantor, including the Second Lien Credit Facility, to the extent of the value of the Collateral owned
by that Guarantor;

    - effectively subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness of that Guarantor that is secured by
Liens on assets that do not constitute a part of the Collateral to the extent of the value of such assets;
and

    - structurally subordinated to all existing and future Indebtedness and other liabilities, including
preferred stock, of any Subsidiaries of that Guarantor that are not Guarantors.

**Guarantees**

Prior to the Completion Date, the Notes will not be guaranteed. Following the Completion Date, Holdings,
ParentCo, each of ParentCo’s existing and future domestic Restricted Subsidiaries that guarantees the Senior Credit
Facilities (other than Panther Co-Issuer, which will be a guarantor under the Senior Credit Facilities and a co-issuer
of the Notes) and any future wholly-owned domestic subsidiary of Holdings of which ParentCo is a subsidiary that


-----

guarantees the obligations of the issuers under the Senior Credit Facilities (the “Guarantors”) will also be required
to Guarantee the Notes to the extent described in “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness
by Restricted Subsidiaries.” We refer to all Guarantors that are Subsidiaries of ParentCo as “Subsidiary Guarantors.”

Following the Completion Date, the Guarantors will initially jointly and severally unconditionally
guarantee, on a senior secured basis, the full and punctual payment when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration
or otherwise, of all obligations of the Issuers under the Indenture and the Notes.

Not all of ParentCo’s Subsidiaries will provide a Guarantee of the Notes. In the event of a bankruptcy,
liquidation, reorganization or similar proceeding of any Non-Guarantor Subsidiary, such Non-Guarantor Subsidiary
will pay the holders of its debt and its trade and other creditors before it will be able to distribute any of its assets to
an Issuer or a Guarantor.

For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company’s subsidiaries that are anticipated to be NonGuarantor Subsidiaries represented approximately 3% of the Company’s consolidated revenues, 1% of the
Company’s consolidated assets, 1% of the Company’s consolidated liabilities and 5% of the Company’s
consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Offering Memorandum).

The obligations of each Guarantor under its Guarantees will be limited as necessary to prevent the
Guarantees from constituting a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer under applicable law or to comply with
corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws.

Any entity that makes a payment under its Guarantee will be entitled, upon payment in full of all
guaranteed obligations under the Indenture, to a contribution from each other Guarantor in an amount equal to such
other Guarantor’s pro rata portion of such payment based on the respective net assets of all the Guarantors at the
time of such payment determined in accordance with GAAP.

If a Guarantee were rendered voidable, it could be subordinated by a court to all other indebtedness
(including guarantees and other contingent liabilities) of the Guarantor, and, depending on the amount of such
indebtedness, a Guarantor’s liability on its Guarantee could be reduced to zero. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to
Our Indebtedness and the Notes—Federal and state fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance laws permit a
court, under certain circumstances, to void the notes and the guarantees (and the related security interests), and, if
that occurs, you may not receive any payments on the notes.”

A Guarantee by a Guarantor shall provide by its terms that it shall be automatically and unconditionally
released and discharged upon:

(1) (a) any sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition (by merger, amalgamation,
consolidation or otherwise) to any Person that is not a Guarantor or an Issuer of (i) as to Subsidiary
Guarantors, the Capital Stock of such Subsidiary Guarantor (including any sale, exchange or transfer), after
which the applicable Subsidiary Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary, or (ii) all or substantially
all the assets of such Guarantor, in either case which sale, exchange or transfer is made in compliance with
the applicable provisions of the Indenture;

(b) upon the merger, amalgamation or consolidation of any Guarantor with and into
an Issuer or another Guarantor or upon the liquidation of such Guarantor, in each case, in
compliance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture;

(c) as to Subsidiary Guarantors, the designation of any Restricted Subsidiary that is
a Subsidiary Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in compliance with the applicable provisions
of the Indenture or the occurrence of any event after which the Subsidiary Guarantor is no longer a
Wholly Owned Subsidiary of ParentCo, in compliance with the applicable provisions of the
Indenture;


-----

(d) the Issuers exercising their legal defeasance option or covenant defeasance
option as described under the caption “Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” or the
satisfaction and discharge of the Issuers’ obligations under the Indenture in accordance with the
terms of the Indenture;

(e) as to Subsidiary Guarantors, to the extent that such Subsidiary Guarantor is not
an Immaterial Subsidiary solely due to the operation of clause (i) of the definition of “Immaterial
Subsidiary,” upon the release of the guarantee referred to in such clause;

(f) such Guarantor being released from all of its obligations under all of its
guarantees of payment of (i) all Indebtedness of the Issuers under the Senior Credit Facilities
(except a discharge or release by or as a result of payment in connection with the enforcement of
remedies under such guarantee or direct obligation) unless at the time of such release or discharge
such Guarantor is then a guarantor or an obligor in respect of any other Indebtedness that would
require it to provide a Guarantee pursuant to the covenant described under “—Certain
Covenants— Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries”; or (ii) in the
case of a Guarantee made by a Guarantor (each, an “Other Guarantee”) as a result of its guarantee
of other Indebtedness of an Issuer or a Guarantor pursuant to the covenant described under the
caption “Certain Covenants— Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted
Subsidiaries,” the relevant Indebtedness, except in the case of (i) or (ii), a release as a result of (x)
payment in full under such guarantee (it being understood that a release subject to a contingent
reinstatement is still considered a release, and if any such Guarantee of such Guarantor under the
Senior Credit Facilities or any Other Guarantee is so reinstated, such Guarantee shall also be
reinstated), or (y) a refinancing or replacement in full of the Senior Credit Facilities and/or such
other Indebtedness;

(g) immediately prior and during the Suspension Period; provided that such
Guarantee shall be reinstated upon the Reversion Date or, if earlier, the guarantee by such
Guarantor of Indebtedness (or commitments in respect thereof) with Pari Passu Lien Priority
relative to the Notes (for the avoidance of doubt, prior to giving effect to any release pursuant to
this clause (g)); or

(h) as described under “—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver;” and

(2) delivery by the Issuers to the Trustee of an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of
Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent provided for in the Indenture relating to such transaction
have been complied with.

**Security**

The Notes, Guarantees and the other Notes Obligations will have the benefit of the Collateral, as to which
the holders of the Notes and holders of the Senior Credit Facilities Obligations and future Other Pari Passu Lien
Obligations (if any) will have a first-priority security interest (subject to Permitted Liens).

**_Collateral_**

The Collateral will be pledged as collateral to the Notes Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Trustee, the
Notes Collateral Agent, and the Holders of the Notes. The Collateral will also be pledged as collateral to the First
Lien Credit Facilities Collateral Agent for the benefit of the First Lien Credit Facilities Obligations. The Notes and
Guarantees, together with the First Lien Credit Facilities Obligations and future Other Pari Passu Lien Obligations
(if any), will be secured by first-priority security interests in the Collateral, subject to Permitted Liens. Following the
Completion Date, the Notes Collateral generally will consist of (i) the equity of ParentCo, the Issuers, any
Intermediate Parent and the Subsidiary Guarantors and (ii) substantially all assets of Holdings, ParentCo, the Issuers,
any Intermediate Parent and the Subsidiary Guarantors, in each case, subject to customary exceptions and in no
event including any Excluded Assets.


-----

Initially, other than Indebtedness secured by Permitted Liens, only the Notes, the Guarantees, the other
Notes Obligations and the First Lien Credit Facilities Obligations will have the benefit of the first-priority security
interest in the Collateral. Except for Indebtedness secured by Permitted Liens (including, the First Lien Credit
Facilities Obligations and, subject to the terms described herein, future Indebtedness constituting Other Pari Passu
Lien Obligations), no other Indebtedness incurred by the Issuers or any Guarantor may share in the first-priority
security interest in the Collateral.

Any additional Indebtedness that is incurred by the Issuers or any Guarantor in compliance with the terms
of the Indenture may also be given a Lien on and security interest in the Collateral that ranks senior, pari passu or
junior to the Lien of the Noteholder Secured Parties (as defined below) in the Collateral. See “—Certain
Covenants—Liens.”

**_Collateral Documents and Certain Related Intercreditor Provisions_**

The Issuers, the Guarantors and the Notes Collateral Agent (on behalf of itself, the Trustee and the Holders
of the Notes) will enter into one or more Collateral Documents creating and establishing the terms of the security
interests that secure the Notes and the Guarantees. These security interests will secure the payment and performance
when due of all of the obligations of the Issuers and the Guarantors under the Notes, the Indenture, the Guarantees
and the Collateral Documents, as provided in the Collateral Documents. The Trustee, the Notes Collateral Agent and
each holder of Notes and each other holder of, or obligee in respect of, any Obligations in respect of the Notes
outstanding at such time are referred to collectively as the “Noteholder Secured Parties.”

**_Possession of the Collateral_**

Subject to the terms of the Collateral Documents, and unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and
be continuing and the Notes Collateral Agent or, subject to the provisions of the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement,
the First Lien Credit Facilities Collateral Agent shall have commenced enforcement of remedies with respect to the
Collateral, the Issuers and the Guarantors will have the right to remain in possession and retain exclusive control of
the Collateral securing the Obligations under the Notes, the Guarantees and the Indenture, to freely operate the
Collateral and to collect, invest and dispose of any income therefrom. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our
Indebtedness and the Notes—Sales of assets by the issuers and the guarantors could reduce the collateral and the
related guarantees.”

**_Further Assurances and After-Acquired Property_**

Subject to the applicable limitations set forth in the Collateral Documents and the Indenture (including
limitations with respect to Excluded Assets), (i) the Issuers will, and will cause each Guarantor to, execute any and
all further documents, financing statements (including continuation statements and amendments), agreements and
instruments, and take all such further actions (including the filing and recording of financing statements, fixture
filings, mortgages, deeds of trust and other documents), that may be required under any applicable law or that the
Notes Collateral Agent may reasonably request, to grant, preserve, maintain, protect and perfect (or continue the
perfection of) the validity and priority of the security interests created or intended to be created by the Collateral
Documents in the Collateral, all at the expense of the Issuers and (ii) if, after the Completion Date, any assets (other
than Excluded Assets), are acquired by an Issuer or are held by any Subsidiary on or after the time it becomes a
Guarantor pursuant to the Indenture, including on the Reversion Date (other than assets constituting Collateral under
a Collateral Document that become subject to the Lien created by such Collateral Document upon acquisition
thereof or assets constituting Excluded Assets), then, if the Issuers have granted a security interest in such asset to
the First Lien Credit Facilities Collateral Agent to secure the First Lien Credit Facilities Obligations, the Issuers will
cause such assets to be subjected to a Lien securing the Secured Obligations and will take such actions as shall be
necessary or as may be reasonably requested by the Notes Collateral Agent to grant and perfect such Liens, all at the
expense of the Issuers.


-----

**Pari Passu Intercreditor Arrangements**

The Notes Collateral Agent will enter into the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement (the “Pari Passu
_Intercreditor Agreement”), dated as of the Completion Date, among the Issuers, the other grantors party thereto, the_
Notes Collateral Agent and the First Lien Credit Facilities Collateral Agent, which Pari Passu Intercreditor
Agreement may be amended as necessary in the event that additional permitted Other Pari Passu Lien Obligations
are incurred. By their acceptance of the Notes, the holders of the Notes will agree to be bound by the terms of the
Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement and will be deemed to have authorized and directed the Notes Collateral Agent
to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement. The term “Collateral”
as used in the description of the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement means the Collateral on which the collateral
agents of two or more classes of Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority have a valid and perfected Lien.
Under the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, the Holders will be represented by the Notes Collateral Agent, the
holders of the First Lien Credit Facilities Obligations will be represented by the First Lien Credit Facilities
Collateral Agent and the holders of each class of Other Pari Passu Lien Obligations will be represented by their
designated agent (each, an “Authorized Representative”). The Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement will provide for
the priorities and other relative rights among the holders of the Notes, the holders of the First Lien Credit Facilities
Obligations and the holders of the Other Pari Passu Lien Obligations, including, among other things, that:

(1) notwithstanding the date, time, method, manner or order of grant, attachment or
perfection (in millions) of any Liens on the Collateral securing the Notes, the First Lien Credit Facilities
Obligations and the Other Pari Passu Lien Obligations, the Liens securing all such Indebtedness shall be of
equal priority; and

(2) the Obligations in respect of the Notes, the First Lien Credit Facilities Obligations and
the Other Pari Passu Lien Obligations may be increased, extended, renewed, replaced, restated,
supplemented, restructured, refunded, refinanced or otherwise amended from time to time, in each case, to
the extent permitted by the Indenture, the Credit Agreement and the documentation governing the Other
Pari Passu Lien Obligations.

The Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement also will provide that only the “Applicable Authorized
_Representative” will have the right to direct foreclosures and take other actions with respect to the Collateral. We_
expect the First Lien Credit Facilities Collateral Agent will be the initial Applicable Authorized Representative until
such time as the occurrence of a Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date (as defined below)
(such date, the “Applicable Authorized Agent Change Date”). Following the Applicable Authorized Agent Change
Date, the Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative (as defined below), will become the Applicable
Authorized Representative.

As of any date, the “Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative” is the Authorized Representative
of the largest class of Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority then-outstanding (other than the same class as
the class of Indebtedness represented by then Applicable Authorized Representative). The “Non-Controlling
_Authorized Representative Enforcement Date” is the date that is 180 days (throughout which 180-day period the_
applicable Authorized Representative was the Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative) after the
occurrence of both (a) an event of default under the terms of the class of Indebtedness represented by such
Authorized Representative and (b) the Notes Collateral Agent’s and each other Authorized Representative’s receipt
of written notice from that Authorized Representative certifying that (i) such Authorized Representative is the Major
Non-Controlling Authorized Representative and that an event of default with respect to the class of Indebtedness
having Pari Passu Lien Priority represented by the Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative has occurred
and is continuing and (ii) such class of Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority is currently due and payable in
full (whether as a result of acceleration thereof or otherwise) in accordance with the terms of that class of
Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority; provided, that such event of default under the terms of the class of
Indebtedness represented by such Authorized Representative shall be continuing at the end of such 180-day period;
provided, further, that the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date shall be stayed and shall
not occur and shall be deemed not to have occurred with respect to any Collateral (1) at any time the Applicable
Authorized Representative has commenced and is diligently pursuing any enforcement action with respect to such
Collateral or (2) at any time an Issuer or any other Grantor that has granted a security interest in such Collateral is
then a debtor under or with respect to (or otherwise subject to) any insolvency or liquidation proceeding.


-----

(i) Only the Applicable Collateral Agent (as defined below) will and will have the right to exercise, or
refrain from exercising, any rights, remedies and powers with respect to the Collateral, including any action to
enforce their respective security interest in or realize upon any Collateral and any right, remedy or power with
respect to any Collateral under any intercreditor agreement (other than the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement), and
then only on the instructions of the Applicable Authorized Representative, (ii) the Applicable Collateral Agent shall
not be required to, and shall not, follow any instructions or directions with respect to Collateral (including with
respect to any intercreditor agreement with respect to any Collateral) from any Non-Controlling Secured Party, it
being understood and agreed that, notwithstanding any such instruction or direction by the Applicable Authorized
Representative, the Applicable Collateral Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion, could
expose such collateral agent to liability or be contrary to any security document or applicable law, and (iii) no NonControlling Secured Party shall, or shall instruct the Applicable Collateral Agent to, commence any judicial or
nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings with respect to, seek to have a trustee, receiver, liquidator or similar official
appointed for or over, attempt any action to take possession of, take any other action to enforce its security interest
in or realize upon, or exercise any other right, remedy or power with respect to (including any right, remedy or
power under any intercreditor agreement other than the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement) any Collateral, whether
under any credit document, applicable law or otherwise, it being agreed that only the Applicable Collateral Agent,
acting on the instructions of the Applicable Authorized Representative and in accordance with the applicable
security documents, shall be entitled to take any such actions or exercise any such rights, remedies and powers with
respect to Collateral. Notwithstanding the equal priority of the Liens established under the Pari Passu Intercreditor
Agreement with respect to the Collateral, the Applicable Collateral Agent (acting on the instructions of the
Applicable Authorized Representative) may deal with the Collateral as if such collateral agent had a senior Lien on
such Collateral. No Non-Controlling Secured Party will contest, protest or object to any foreclosure proceeding or
action brought by the Applicable Collateral Agent, the Applicable Authorized Representative or any Controlling
Secured Party, or any other exercise by the Applicable Collateral Agent, the Applicable Authorized Representative
or any Controlling Secured Party of any rights, remedies or powers with respect to the Collateral, or seek to cause
either Collateral Agent to do so.

“Applicable Collateral Agent” means (i) until the earlier of (x) the discharge of First Lien Credit Facilities
Obligations and (y) the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date, the First Lien Credit
Facilities Collateral Agent and (ii) from and after the earlier of (x) the discharge of First Lien Credit Facilities
Obligations and (y) the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date, the Additional Collateral
Agent. Note that the discharge of First Lien Credit Facilities Obligations will not be deemed to have occurred in
connection with a refinancing of First Lien Credit Facilities Obligations with additional Indebtedness having Pari
Passu Lien Priority which has been designated in writing by the First Lien Credit Facilities Collateral Agent to the
Notes Collateral Agent and each other Authorized Representative as the “Credit Agreement” for purposes of the Pari
Passu Intercreditor Agreement.

“Additional Collateral Agent” means, with respect to the Collateral (x) for so long as the Notes are the only
class of additional Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority outstanding, the Notes Collateral Agent and (y)
thereafter, the Collateral Agent of the same class as the Authorized Representative that is the Applicable Authorized
Representative with respect to such Collateral at such time.

“Controlling Secured Parties” means, at any time with respect to any Collateral, (i) at any time when the
First Lien Credit Facilities Collateral Agent is the Applicable Collateral Agent, the Credit Agreement Secured
Parties and (ii) at any other time, the Pari Notes Debt Secured Parties of the same class as the Authorized
Representative that is the Applicable Authorized Representative with respect to such Collateral at such time.

“Non-Controlling Secured Parties” means, at any time with respect to any Collateral, the Pari Notes Debt
Secured Parties that are not Controlling Secured Parties at such time with respect to such Collateral.

If (i) an event of default has occurred and is continuing under any Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien
Priority, and any Authorized Representative or Pari Notes Debt Secured Party is taking action to enforce rights in
respect of any Collateral, (ii) any distribution is made with respect to any Collateral in any insolvency or liquidation
proceeding of an Issuer or any other Grantor (including any adequate protection payments) or (iii) any Authorized
Representative or Pari Notes Debt Secured Party receives any payment with respect to any Collateral pursuant to
any intercreditor agreement (other than the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement), the proceeds of any sale, collection


-----

or other liquidation of any such Collateral by any Authorized Representative or Pari Notes Debt Secured Party on
account of such enforcement of rights or exercise of remedies, and any such distributions or payments received by
Authorized Representative or Pari Notes Debt Secured Party, will be applied (i) first, to payment of all amounts
owing to the Notes Collateral Agent, the First Lien Credit Facilities Collateral Agent, any other collateral agent with
respect to Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority and the other Authorized Representatives, in their capacities
as such, (ii) second, among the Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority to the payment in full of all such
Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority on a ratable basis; provided that following the commencement of any
insolvency or liquidation proceeding of an Issuer or any other Grantor, solely as among the secured parties and
solely for purposes of this clause and not any Notes Documents or any other document governing any other
Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority, in the event the value of the Collateral is not sufficient for the entire
amount of post-petition interest, fees and expenses to be allowed under the Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable
bankruptcy law in such insolvency or liquidation proceeding, the amount of such Indebtedness shall include only the
maximum amount of post-petition interest, fees and expenses on such Indebtedness allowable under the applicable
bankruptcy law in such insolvency or liquidation proceeding, and (iii) third, to the Issuers and the other Grantors or
their successors or assigns, as their interests may appear, or to whosoever may be lawfully entitled to receive the
same, or as a court of competent jurisdiction may direct.

None of the holders of Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority may institute any suit or assert in any
suit, insolvency or liquidation proceeding or other proceeding any claim against the Notes Collateral Agent, any
other collateral agent with respect to Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority or any other holder of Other Pari
Passu Lien Obligations seeking damages from or other relief by way of specific performance, instructions or
otherwise with respect to any Collateral. In addition, none of the holders of Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien
Priority may seek to have any Collateral or any part thereof marshaled upon any foreclosure or other disposition of
such Collateral. If any holder of Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority obtains possession of any Collateral or
realizes any proceeds or payment in respect thereof, in each case, as a result of the enforcement of remedies, at any
time prior to the discharge of each of such Indebtedness, then it must hold such Collateral, proceeds or payment in
trust for the other holders of Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority and promptly transfer such Collateral,
proceeds or payment to the Applicable Authorized Representative to be distributed in accordance with the Pari
Passu Intercreditor Agreement.

The Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the holders of Indebtedness having Pari Passu
Lien Priority of each class (and not the holders of Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority of any other class)
bear the risk of (a) any determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that (i) any Indebtedness having Pari
Passu Lien Priority of such class is unenforceable under applicable Law or is subordinated to any other obligations
(other than to any Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority of any other class), (ii) any Indebtedness having Pari
Passu Lien Priority of such class does not have a valid and perfected Lien on any of the Collateral securing any
Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority of any other class and/or (iii) any intervening security interest exists
securing any other obligations (other than Other Pari Passu Lien Obligations) on a basis ranking prior to the security
interest of such class of Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority but junior to the security interest of any other
class of Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority, or (b) the existence of any Collateral securing Indebtedness
having Pari Passu Lien Priority of any other class that does not constitute Collateral with respect to Indebtedness
having Pari Passu Lien Priority of such class (any condition referred to in clause (a) or (b) with respect to
Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority of such class being referred to as an “Impairment” of such class). In
the event an Impairment exists with respect to Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority of any class, the results
of such Impairment shall be borne solely by the holders of Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority of such
class, and the rights of such holders (including the right to receive distributions in accordance with the Pari Passu
Intercreditor Agreement) shall be modified to the extent necessary so that the results of such Impairment are borne
solely by such holders.

The Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement provides that it shall continue in full force and effect
notwithstanding the commencement and continuance of any insolvency or liquidation proceeding by or against an
Issuer or any of its subsidiaries. The relative rights as to the Collateral and proceeds thereof shall continue after the
commencement of any insolvency or liquidation proceeding on the same basis as prior to the date of the petition
therefor. All references in the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement to an Issuer or any Guarantor shall include such
Issuer or Guarantor as a debtor-in-possession and any receiver or trustee for such Issuer or Guarantor.


-----

**First/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement**

The Notes Collateral Agent will enter into the First/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement (the
“First/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement”), dated as of the Completion Date, among the Issuers, the other
grantors party thereto, the Notes Collateral Agent, the First Lien Credit Facilities Collateral Agent and the Second
Lien Credit Facility Collateral Agent, which First/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement may be amended as
necessary in the event that additional permitted Indebtedness is incurred and to be secured by the Collateral. By their
acceptance of the Notes, the holders of the Notes will agree to be bound by the terms of the First/Second Lien
Intercreditor Agreement and will be deemed to have authorized and directed the Notes Collateral Agent to execute,
deliver and perform its obligations under the First/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement. The term “Collateral” as
used in the description of the First/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement means the Collateral on which in which the
holders of Senior Obligations and the holders of Second Priority Debt Obligations hold or are purported to hold a
security interest or Lien at such time.

The First/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the priorities and other relative rights
among the holders of the Senior Obligations, on the one hand, and the holders of the Second Priority Debt
Obligations, on the other hand, including, among other things, that:

(1) notwithstanding the date, time, manner or order of filing or recordation of any document
or instrument or grant, attachment or perfection (a) any liens on the Collateral securing or purporting to
secure any Senior Obligations shall have priority over and be senior in all respects and prior to any Lien on
the Collateral securing or purporting to secure any Second Priority Debt Obligations and (b) any lien on the
Collateral securing or purporting to secure any Second Priority Debt Obligations shall be junior and
subordinate in all respects to all Liens on the Collateral securing or purporting to secure any Senior
Obligations.

(2) the Obligations in respect of the Senior Obligations may be increased, extended,
renewed, replaced, restated, supplemented, restructured, refunded, refinanced or otherwise amended from
time to time, in each case, to the extent permitted by the Indenture, the First Lien Credit Agreement and the
Second Lien Credit Facility .

The First/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement also will provide that only the “Senior Representatives”
will have the right to direct foreclosures and take other actions with respect to the Collateral until the date that is 180
days after the occurrence of both (a) an event of default under the terms of the Second Priority Debt Documents and
(b) each Senior Representative’s receipt of written notice from the applicable second priority representative
certifying that (i) an event of default with respect to the class of Indebtedness having Junior Lien Priority
represented by the applicable second priority representative has occurred and is continuing and (ii) such class of
Indebtedness having Junior Lien Priority is currently due and payable in full (whether as a result of acceleration
thereof or otherwise) in accordance with the terms of that class of Indebtedness having Junior Lien Priority;
provided, that such event of default under the terms of the class of Indebtedness represented by such Authorized
Representative shall be continuing at the end of such 180-day period; provided, further, that such 180 day period
shall be stayed and shall not occur and shall be deemed not to have occurred with respect to any Collateral (1) at any
time a Senior Representative has commenced and is diligently pursuing remedies with respect to any material
portion of the Collateral, (2) at any time an Issuer or any other Grantor that has granted a security interest in such
Collateral is then a debtor under or with respect to (or otherwise subject to) any insolvency or liquidation proceeding
or (3) at any time that exercise of remedies is stayed by applicable law.

“Second Priority Debt Documents” means, the agreements governing the Second Priority Debt Obligations.

“Second Priority Debt Obligations” means, the Second Lien Credit Facility Obligations and any
obligations in respect of Indebtedness and guarantees that have a Junior Lien Priority.

“Senior Obligations” means, the Obligations in respect of the Notes, the First Lien Credit Facilities
Obligations and any Other Pari Passu Lien Obligations.


-----

**Release of Collateral**

The Issuers and the Guarantors will be entitled to the releases of property and other assets included in the
Collateral from the Liens securing the Notes under various circumstances.

A Subsidiary Guarantor or Issuer shall automatically and unconditionally be released from its obligations
under the Notes Documents, and all security interests created by the Collateral Documents in Collateral owned by
such Subsidiary Guarantor or Issuer shall be automatically and unconditionally released, (1) upon the consummation
of any transaction or designation permitted by the Indenture as a result of which such Subsidiary Guarantor or Issuer
ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary or becomes an Excluded Subsidiary or (2) at the written election of the Issuers,
in connection with a transaction permitted under the Indenture, as a result of which any such Subsidiary Guarantor
or such Issuer ceases to be a Wholly Owned Subsidiary.

Upon any sale, disposition or other transfer by an Issuer or any Guarantor (other than to an Issuer or any
Guarantor) of any Collateral in a transaction not prohibited under the covenant described under “—Repurchase at
the Option of Holders—Asset Sales”, or upon the effectiveness of any written consent to the release of the security
interest created under any Collateral Document in any Collateral, the security interests in such Collateral created by
the Collateral Documents shall be automatically and unconditionally released.

Upon the release of an Issuer from its obligations under the Notes Documents in compliance with the
Indenture, the security interest in any Collateral owned by such Issuer created by the Collateral Documents shall be
automatically and unconditionally released.

Upon the release of a Guarantor from its Guarantee in compliance with the Indenture, the security interest
in any Collateral owned by such Guarantor created by the Collateral Documents shall be automatically and
unconditionally released.

Upon the designation of a Restricted Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in compliance with this
Agreement, the security interest created by the Collateral Documents in the Equity Interests of such new
Unrestricted Subsidiary shall automatically and unconditionally be released.

Upon the occurrence of a Holdings Termination Event, Holdings shall be released from its Guarantee and
the security interest in any Collateral owned by Holdings created by the Collateral Documents shall be automatically
and unconditionally released.

Upon (i) payment in full of the principal of, together with accrued and unpaid interest on, the Notes and all
other obligations (other than contingent indemnity obligations for which no demand has been made) under the
Indenture, the Guarantees under the Indenture and the Collateral Documents that are due and payable at or prior to
the time such principal, together with accrued and unpaid interest, is paid, or (ii) a legal defeasance or covenant
defeasance under the Indenture as described below under “—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” or a
discharge of the Indenture as described under “—Satisfaction and Discharge,” all obligations under the Notes
Documents and all security interests created by the Collateral Documents shall be automatically and unconditionally
released.

So long as any Senior Credit Facilities Obligations or Other Pari Passu Lien Obligations are outstanding,
upon the release of all Liens thereon securing the Senior Credit Facilities Obligations and Other Pari Passu Lien
Obligations, all security interests created by the Collateral Documents shall be automatically and unconditionally
released.

The security interests created by the Collateral Documents shall also be automatically and unconditionally
released as described under “—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver” and pursuant to the Pari Passu Intercreditor
Agreement.

Any Lien granted to or held by the Notes Collateral Agent under any Notes Document shall be
automatically released, in each case on any property (i) so that a Lien may be granted (or continue to subsist) over


-----

such property that is not prohibited by (and subject to any conditions in) clause (1), (4), (5), (6) (solely as it relates to
Indebtedness permitted by clause (4) or (12)(y) of the second paragraph under the covenant described under the
caption “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock”), (7),
(8), (9)(c), (10)(a), (19), (20), (26) or (40) of the definition of Permitted Liens, provided, that in the case of clause
(6) (solely as it relates to Indebtedness permitted by clause (12)(y) of the second paragraph under the covenant
described under the caption “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and
Preferred Stock”) and clause (20) of the definition of Permitted Liens, the fair market value of the Collateral
released pursuant to this clause (i) shall not exceed the amount of the Liens then permitted to be incurred under the
applicable clause of the definition of Permitted Liens, (ii) that is granted to or held by the Notes Collateral Agent
under any Notes Document to the holder of any Lien upon such property becoming subject to another Lien
permitted by clause (6) (solely as it relates to Indebtedness permitted by clause (4) of the second paragraph under the
covenant described under the caption “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified
Stock and Preferred Stock”), (7), (8), (12) or (40) of the definition of Permitted Liens, to the extent the contract or
agreement pursuant to which such other Lien is granted prohibits any other Liens on such property.

Notwithstanding and in addition to the foregoing, and in addition to Liens on the Collateral that be released
as described herein, the First Lien Administrative Agent, the First Lien Collateral Agent and the Notes Collateral
Agent shall, at the written request of ParentCo, release the Lien on Collateral valued in the aggregate not in excess
of the greater of $117,760,000 and 10% of Consolidated EBITDA for the most recently ended Test Period,
calculated on a Pro Forma Basis at the time of such request, in any fiscal year without the consent of the Trustee,
any Holder or any other Person, so long as, at the time of any such release, ParentCo shall have delivered to the
Notes Collateral Agent an Officer’s Certificate setting forth the value of the Collateral to be released (as reasonably
determined and calculated by ParentCo in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive).

**Ranking**

The payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes and the payment of any
Guarantee will rank pari passu in right of payment to all existing and future Senior Indebtedness of an Issuer or the
relevant Guarantor, as the case may be, including the obligations of such Issuer and such Guarantor under the Senior
Credit Facilities.

The Notes will be effectively senior in right of payment to all of any Issuer’s and any Guarantor’s existing
and future unsecured Indebtedness and junior lien Indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing the
Notes. As of December 31, 2023, on an as adjusted basis after giving effect to the Transactions, the Issuers and the
Guarantors would have had secured Indebtedness of approximately $8,000 million outstanding (including $1,900
million outstanding under the Second Lien Credit Facility) and an additional $1,175 million of unused revolving
credit loan capacity under the First Lien Credit Facilities.

Although the Indenture will contain limitations on the amount of additional Indebtedness that the Issuers
and the Guarantors may incur, under certain circumstances the amount of such Indebtedness could be substantial
and, in any case, such Indebtedness may be Secured Indebtedness or Senior Indebtedness. See “Certain Covenants—
Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock.”

**Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes**

The Issuers will maintain one or more paying agents for the Notes. The initial paying agent for the Notes
will be the Trustee. The Issuers will also maintain a registrar. The initial registrar will be the Trustee. The registrar
will maintain a register reflecting ownership of the Notes outstanding from time to time and will make payments on
and facilitate transfer of Notes on behalf of the Issuers. Payments of principal of, premium, if any, and interest on
the Notes will be payable at the office or agency designated by the Issuers or, at the option of the Issuers, payment
of interest may be made by check mailed to the Holders at their respective addresses set forth in the register of
Holders. Until otherwise designated by the Issuers, the Issuers’ office or agency maintained for such purpose will be
the office of the Trustee.

The Issuers may change the paying agents or the registrars without prior notice to the Holders. The Issuers
or any of their Subsidiaries may act as a paying agent or registrar.

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

The Escrow Issuer will issue an aggregate principal amount of $2,750.0 million of Notes in this offering.
The Notes will mature on         , 2031. Subject to compliance with the covenants described under the captions
“Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred
Stock” and “Certain Covenants—Liens,” the Issuers may issue additional Notes from time to time after this offering
under the Indenture (any such notes, the “Additional Notes”). The Notes offered by the Issuers and any Additional
Notes subsequently issued under the Indenture will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture,
including in respect of waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase. If any Additional Notes are not
fungible with any other Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes or if the Issuers otherwise determine that any
Additional Notes should be differentiated from any other Notes, such Additional Notes shall have a separate CUSIP
number, provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, such Additional Notes will still constitute a single series with all
other Notes issued under the Indenture for all purposes other than for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Unless the
context requires otherwise, references to “Notes” for all purposes under the Indenture and this “Description of the
Notes” include any Additional Notes that are actually issued. The Notes will be issued in minimum denominations
of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.

Interest on the Notes will accrue at the rate of      % per annum and will be payable semi-annually in
arrears on           and          , commencing on          , 2024, to the Holders of Notes of record on
the immediately preceding           and           . Interest on the Notes will accrue from the most recent date
to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from and including the Issue Date. The rights of
Holders of beneficial interests in the Notes to receive the payments on such Notes are subject to applicable
procedures of DTC. If the due date for any payment in respect of any Notes is not a Business Day at the place at
which such payment is due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due until the
next succeeding Business Day at such place, and will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a
result of any such delay. If the redemption date falls on a date that is on or after the record date and on or before the
corresponding interest payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date will be
paid on the redemption date to the Holder in whose name the Note is registered at the close of business on such
record date in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC, and no additional interest will be payable to
Holders whose Notes will be subject to redemption by the Issuers. Interest on the Notes will be computed on the
basis of a 360-day year comprising twelve 30-day months.

**Mandatory Redemption; Offers to Purchase; Open Market Purchases**

Except as described under the caption “Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption,” the Issuers
are not required to make any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes.
Additionally, under certain circumstances, the Issuers may be required to offer to purchase Notes as described under
the caption “Repurchase at the Option of Holders.” The Issuers may at any time and from time to time purchase
Notes in the open market or otherwise.

**Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption**

This offering may be consummated prior to the consummation of the Acquisition. Unless the Acquisition
will be consummated substantially concurrently with the closing of this offering on the Issue Date, on the Issue
Date, the Escrow Issuers will execute and deliver an escrow agreement (as amended, supplemented or modified
from time to time, the “Escrow Agreement”) with the Trustee and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association,
as escrow agent (the “Escrow Agent”), pursuant to which an amount equal to the gross proceeds of this offering will
be deposited into a segregated escrow account (the “Escrow Account”) denominated in U.S. Dollars. By its
acceptance of the Notes, each Holder shall be deemed to authorize and direct the Trustee to execute, deliver and
perform its obligations under the Escrow Agreement. If the Acquisition is consummated substantially concurrently
with the closing of this offering on the Issue Date, the “Completion Date” will be deemed to be the “Issue Date.”

The Escrow Account will not include cash to fund any accrued and unpaid interest owing to Holders of the
Notes, which is included in the Special Mandatory Redemption Price (as defined below). In the event that the
Special Mandatory Price payable upon such Special Mandatory Redemption (as defined below) for the Notes
exceeds the amount of the applicable Escrowed Property (as defined below), the Investors will be required to fund


-----

the difference between the applicable Special Mandatory Redemption Price plus fees and expenses and the amount
of the Escrowed Property pursuant to a commitment provided by them.

The initial funds deposited in the Escrow Account, and all other funds, securities, interest, dividends,
distributions, earnings and other property and payments credited to the Escrow Account in connection with the
Notes (less any property and/or funds paid in accordance with the Escrow Agreement) are referred to, collectively,
as the “Escrowed Property.” The Escrowed Property will be controlled by the Escrow Agent, on behalf of the
Trustee and the Holders of the Notes.

On the Business Day prior to a Special Mandatory Redemption Date for the Notes, in accordance with the
Escrow Agreement, the Investors will deposit (or cause to be deposited) in the Escrow Account, an amount of cash
that, when taken together with the Escrowed Property then on deposit in the Escrow Account, will be sufficient to
fund a Special Mandatory Redemption of the Notes on the Special Mandatory Redemption Date. All funds deposited
into the Escrow Account will be held by the Escrow Agent for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders. Upon the
consummation of the Acquisition, the foregoing provisions regarding the special mandatory redemption will cease to
apply. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the Notes—Unless the Acquisition will be
consummated on the closing date of this offering, if the Escrow Conditions are not satisfied, the Escrow Issuers will
be required to redeem the notes, which means that you may not obtain the return you expect on the notes.”

In order to cause the Escrow Agent to release the Escrowed Property to, or as directed by, the Escrow
Issuer (the “Escrow Release”), the Escrow Issuers must deliver to the Escrow Agent and the Trustee on or prior to
December 31, 2024 (the “Escrow Outside Date”), an Officer’s Certificate (the “Escrow Release Officer’s
_Certificate”) certifying that the following conditions (the “Escrow Conditions”) have been or, substantially_
concurrently with the release of the Escrowed Property will be, satisfied (the date of the Escrow Release is
hereinafter referred to as the “Completion Date”):

(1) the Acquisition shall have been, or substantially concurrently with or promptly following the
Escrow Release will be, consummated;

(2) the Senior Credit Facilities shall have become effective or will become effective substantially
concurrently with or promptly following the Escrow Release;

(3) all Escrowed Property will be applied in the manner described under the caption “Use of
Proceeds” in this Offering Memorandum; and

(4) (a) the Escrow Issuer shall have been, or substantially concurrently with the Escrow Release shall
be, merged with and into the Company and the Company shall have assumed, or substantially
concurrently with the Escrow Release shall assume, by supplemental indenture or joinder, as
applicable, all of the obligations of the Escrow Issuer under the Notes, the Indenture and the
Collateral Documents and (b) the Guarantors shall have, by supplemental indenture or joinder,
effective upon the Completion Date and consummation of the Acquisition, become, or
substantially concurrently with or promptly following the Escrow Release shall become,
guarantors of the Notes and parties to the Indenture and the Collateral Documents.

To secure the payment of the special mandatory redemption, the Escrow Issuers will also grant to the
Trustee for its benefit and the benefit of the Holders a security interest in the Escrow Account, and the Escrow
Agreement will require that such security interest be perfected prior to the consummation of this offering of Notes.
See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the Notes—In a bankruptcy proceeding, the holders of
notes might not be able to apply the Escrowed Property to repay the notes without bankruptcy court approval.” If at
any time the Escrow Account contains cash having an aggregate value in excess of the Special Mandatory
Redemption Price on the Escrow Outside Date, such excess funds may be released to the Escrow Issuers at the
option of the Escrow Issuers, after payment of fees and expenses of the Trustee and Escrow Agent, if any. Upon the
acceleration of the maturity of the Notes or the failure to pay principal at maturity or upon certain redemptions and
repurchases of the Notes, the Escrow Agreement will provide for the foreclosure by the Trustee upon the funds held
in the Escrow Account. In the event of such a foreclosure, the proceeds of the Escrow Account will be applied, first,
to amounts owing to the Trustee and Escrow Agent in respect of fees, expenses and other amounts payable to the


-----

Trustee and Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement and the Indenture, second, to the
holders of the Notes to the full extent of all Obligations under the Indenture and the Notes and, third, any remainder
to the Escrow Issuers or their estates.

Except as the context otherwise requires, the provisions described elsewhere in this “Description of the
Notes” refer to the provisions of the Indenture as will be in effect following the consummation of the Acquisition
and the satisfaction of the Escrow Conditions.

**Activities Prior to the Escrow Release**

Prior to the satisfaction of the Escrow Conditions, the Escrow Issuers will be limited purpose entities whose
primary activities are restricted to issuing the Notes, issuing capital stock to, and receiving capital contributions
from, the Investors, performing their obligations in respect of the Notes under the Indenture and the Escrow
Agreement, consummating the Transactions, the Escrow Conditions and the Escrow Release, redeeming the Notes
as set forth above under the caption “—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption,” as applicable, and
conducting such other activities as are necessary or appropriate to carry out the activities described above. Prior to
the satisfaction of the Escrow Conditions, the Escrow Issuers will not engage in any material business activity or
enter into any material transaction or agreement except in the ordinary course of business or reasonably necessary to
effectuate the Transactions substantially in accordance with the description of the Transactions set forth in this
Offering Memorandum, together with such amendments, modifications and waivers that are not, individually or in
the aggregate, materially adverse to us (after giving effect to the consummation of the Transactions) or to the
Holders of the Notes, as determined by the Escrow Issuers in good faith.

Prior to the Completion Date, the Company, McGriff Insurance, Panther Co-Issuer and the Guarantors will
not be parties to the Indenture. Accordingly, prior to the Completion Date, the Company, McGriff Insurance,
Panther Co-Issuer and the Guarantors will not be subject to the restrictions, agreements or covenants in the
Indenture.

**Optional Redemption**

Except as set forth below, the Issuers will not be entitled to redeem Notes at their option prior
to         , 2027.

At any time prior to         , 2027, the Issuers may on one or more occasions redeem all or a part of the
Notes, upon notice as described under the caption “Selection and Notice,” at a redemption price equal to 100% of
the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed plus the Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, thereon, to, but not including, the date of redemption (the “Redemption Date”).

On and after         , 2027, the Issuers may on one or more occasions redeem all or a part of the Notes,
upon notice as described under the caption “Selection and Notice,” at the redemption prices (expressed as
percentages of principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed) set forth below, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if
any, thereon, to, but not including, the applicable Redemption Date, if redeemed during the twelve-month period
beginning on         , of each of the years indicated below:

**Year** **Percentage**

2027 .......................................................... %
2028 .......................................................... %
2029 and thereafter ................................... %

In addition, prior to         , 2027, the Issuers may, at their option, on one or more occasions redeem up
to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes issued under the Indenture (including the principal amount of any
Additional Notes issued under the Indenture) at a redemption price equal to       % of the aggregate principal
amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but not including, the
applicable Redemption Date, with the net cash proceeds received by an Issuer from one or more Equity Offerings;
_provided that (a) at least 50% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes originally issued under the Indenture on_


-----

the Issue Date (other than Notes held by the Issuers or any of their Affiliates) remains outstanding immediately after
the occurrence of each such redemption, unless all such Notes are redeemed substantially concurrently and (b) each
such redemption occurs within 180 days of the date of closing of each such Equity Offering.

In addition, at any time and from time to time prior to         , 2027, the Issuers may redeem up to 10%
of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes issued under the Indenture (including any Additional Notes) during
each twelve-month period beginning on the Issue Date at a redemption price of 103% of the aggregate principal
amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but not including, the
applicable Redemption Date.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for all of the outstanding Notes at such
time, including a Change of Control Offer or Asset Sale Offer, if Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal
amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the Issuers,
or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of the Issuers, purchase all of the Notes validly tendered and not
withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuers or such third party will have the right upon not less than 10 nor more than 60
days’ prior notice to the Holders and the Trustee, given not more than 30 days following such purchase date, to
redeem all Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a redemption price equal to the price offered to
each other Holder (excluding any early tender or incentive fee) in such tender offer plus, to the extent not included
in the tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but not including, the applicable
Redemption Date.

Any notice of any redemption may be given prior to the redemption thereof, and any such redemption or
notice may, at the Issuers’ discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent, including, without limitation,
the consummation of an incurrence or issuance of debt or equity or a Change of Control or other corporate
transaction. If such redemption is so subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice shall
describe each such condition, and if applicable, shall state that, in the Issuers’ discretion, the redemption date may
be delayed until such time (including more than 60 days after the date the notice of redemption was mailed or
delivered, including by electronic transmission) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied, or such redemption
or purchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not
have been satisfied by the redemption date, or by the redemption date as so delayed. In addition, the Issuers may
provide in such notice that payment of the redemption price and performance of the Issuers’ obligations with respect
to such redemption may be performed by another Person.

The Notes to be redeemed shall be selected by the DTC in accordance with their procedures in the manner
described under the caption “Selection and Notice.”

**Selection and Notice**

If the Issuers are redeeming less than all of the Notes issued under the Indenture at any time, the Trustee
will select the Notes to be redeemed (1) in accordance with customary DTC procedures or (2) on a pro rata basis to
the extent practicable, or, if the pro rata basis is not practicable for any reason, by lot or by such other method as
most nearly approximates a pro rata basis subject to customary DTC procedures. No Notes of $2,000 or less can be
redeemed in part.

Notices of redemption shall be delivered electronically or mailed by first-class mail, postage prepaid, at
least 10 but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of Notes (with a copy to the Trustee)
at such Holder’s registered address or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC, except that redemption
notices may be delivered more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a
defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture. If any Note is to be purchased or redeemed
in part only, any notice of purchase or redemption that relates to such Note shall state the portion of the principal
amount thereof that has been or is to be purchased or redeemed. With respect to Notes represented by certificated
notes, the Issuers will issue a new Note in a principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the original Note
in the name of the Holder upon cancellation of the original Note. Notes called for redemption become due on the
date fixed for redemption. On and after the Redemption Date, unless the Issuers default in the payment of the
redemption price, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of them called for redemption.


-----

**Repurchase at the Option of Holders**

**_Change of Control_**

The Indenture provides that if a Change of Control occurs, unless the Issuers have previously or
substantially concurrently therewith delivered a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Notes as
described under the caption “Optional Redemption,” the Issuers will make an offer to purchase all of the Notes
pursuant to the offer described below (the “Change of Control Offer”) at a price in cash (the “Change of Control
_Payment”) equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but_
not including, the date of purchase. Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Issuers will send notice of
such Change of Control Offer by electronic delivery in accordance with the procedures of DTC or first-class mail,
with a copy to the Trustee and the paying agent, to each Holder of Notes to the address of such Holder appearing in
the security register or otherwise in accordance with DTC’s applicable procedures, with the following information:

(1) that a Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to this covenant, and that all Notes
properly tendered pursuant to such Change of Control Offer will be accepted for payment by the Issuers;

(2) the purchase price and the purchase date, which will be no earlier than 10 days nor later
than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered except in the case of a conditional Change of Control
Offer made in advance of a Change of Control as described below (the “Change of Control Payment
Date”);

(3) that any Note not properly tendered will remain outstanding and continue to accrue
interest;

(4) that unless the Issuers default in the payment of the Change of Control Payment, all
Notes accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest on the
Change of Control Payment Date;

(5) that Holders will be entitled to withdraw their tendered Notes and their election to require
the Issuers to purchase such Notes; provided that the paying agent receives, not later than the close of
business on the second Business Day prior to the expiration date of the Change of Control Offer, a
facsimile transmission, electronic transmission or letter setting forth the name of the Holder of the Notes,
the principal amount of Notes tendered for purchase, and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing its
tendered Notes and its election to have such Notes purchased;

(6) that Holders whose Notes are being purchased only in part will be issued new Notes and
such new Notes will be equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered. The
unpurchased portion of the Notes must be equal to at least $2,000 or any integral multiple of $1,000 in
excess thereof;

(7) if such notice is delivered prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the
Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control and describing each
such condition; and

(8) the other instructions, as determined by the Issuers, consistent with the covenant
described hereunder, that a Holder must follow.

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the
Indenture and the Issuers comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations, then the Issuers shall not be
deemed to have breached their obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof.


-----

On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuers will, to the extent permitted by law,

(1) accept for payment all Notes issued by it or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant
to the Change of Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the aggregate Change of Control
Payment in respect of all Notes or portions thereof so tendered; and

(3) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee for cancellation the Notes so accepted
together with an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee stating that such Notes or portions thereof have been
tendered to and purchased by the Issuers.

The Senior Credit Facilities will, and future credit agreements or other agreements relating to Indebtedness
to which ParentCo becomes a party may, provide that certain change of control events with respect to ParentCo
would constitute a default thereunder (including a Change of Control). If we experience a change of control that
triggers a default under the Senior Credit Facilities or such other indebtedness, we could seek a waiver of such
default or seek to refinance the Senior Credit Facilities or such other indebtedness. In the event we do not obtain
such a waiver or refinance the Senior Credit Facilities or such other indebtedness, such default could result in
amounts outstanding under the Senior Credit Facilities or such other indebtedness being declared due and payable.

Our ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be
limited by our then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to
make any required repurchases. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the Notes—We may not
be able to finance a change of control offer or asset sale offer required by the indenture that will govern the notes.”

The Change of Control purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or
discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control
purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the Initial Purchasers and us. After the Completion Date, we
have no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control, although it is possible that we
could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, we could, in the future, enter into
certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a
Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of indebtedness outstanding at such time
or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to incur additional Indebtedness
are contained in the covenant described under the caption “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of
Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” and “Certain Covenants—Liens.” Such
restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal
amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the
Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders of the Notes protection in the event
of a highly leveraged transaction.

The Issuers will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if a third
party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the
requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuers and purchases
all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such
Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of making of the
Change of Control Offer.

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of
ParentCo and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any Person. Although there is a limited body of case law
interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable
law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular
transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of ParentCo and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a
Holder of Notes may require the Issuers to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above.


-----

The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuers’ obligation to make an offer to repurchase the
Notes as a result of a Change of Control, including the definition of Change of Control and Change of Control, may
be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
Notes then outstanding.

**_Asset Sales_**

The Indenture will provide that from and after the Completion Date, ParentCo will not consummate, and
will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to consummate, an Asset Sale, unless:

(1) ParentCo or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration at the
time of such Asset Sale at least equal to the fair market value (as determined at the time of contractually
agreeing to such Asset Sale) of the assets sold or otherwise disposed of; and

(2) except in the case of a Permitted Asset Swap, if the property or assets sold or otherwise
disposed of have a fair market value in excess of the greater of $588.8 million and 50% of Consolidated
EBITDA for the most recently ended Test Period at the time of such disposition, calculated on a Pro Forma
Basis, at least 75% of the consideration for such Asset Sale, together with all other Asset Sales since the
Completion Date (on a cumulative basis) received by ParentCo or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case
may be, is in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents; provided that the following shall be deemed to be Cash
Equivalents for purposes of this provision and for no other purpose:

(a) any liabilities, contingent or otherwise, of ParentCo or such Restricted
Subsidiary, other than liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the Notes or that are owed
to ParentCo or a Restricted Subsidiary that (x) are assumed by the transferee of any such assets (or
a third party in connection with such transfer) or (y) are otherwise cancelled or terminated in
connection with the transaction with such transferee (other than intercompany debt owed to
ParentCo or the Restricted Subsidiaries) and, in each case, for which ParentCo and all of the
Restricted Subsidiaries have been validly released;

(b) any securities, notes or other obligations or assets received by ParentCo or such
Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted by ParentCo or such Restricted
Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents (to the extent of the cash or Cash Equivalents received)
within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Sale;

(c) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that ceases to be a Restricted
Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Sale (other than intercompany debt owed to ParentCo or any
Restricted Subsidiary), to the extent that ParentCo and each other Restricted Subsidiary are
released from any guarantee of payment of the principal amount of such Indebtedness in
connection with such Asset Sale in accordance with the terms of the Indenture;

(d) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of an Issuer or a Guarantor (other than
intercompany debt owed to ParentCo or any Restricted Subsidiary and other than Subordinated
Indebtedness) received after the Completion Date from Persons who are not Holdings, ParentCo
or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(e) any Designated Non-cash Consideration received by ParentCo or such
Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset Sale having an aggregate fair market value taken together with
all other Designated Non-cash Consideration received pursuant to this clause (e) that is at that time
outstanding, not to exceed the greater of $588.8 million and 50% of Consolidated EBITDA for the
most recently ended Test Period at the time of the receipt of such Designated Non-cash
Consideration, calculated on a Pro Forma Basis (with the fair market value of each such item of
Designated Non-cash Consideration being measured pursuant to this clause (e) at ParentCo’s
option, either at the time of contractually agreeing to such Asset Sale or at the time received and,
in either case, without giving effect to subsequent changes in value); and


-----

(f) any Investment, Capital Stock, assets, property or capital or other expenditure of
the kind referred to in clauses (2) or (3) of the next paragraph.

Within 720 days after the receipt of any Net Proceeds of any Asset Sale of Collateral (the “Proceeds
_Application Period”) in excess of the Excess Asset Sale Proceeds Amount (“Adjusted Net Proceeds”), ParentCo or_
such Restricted Subsidiary, at their option, may apply an amount equal to the Required Percentage of the Adjusted
Net Proceeds from such Asset Sale of Collateral (the “Applicable Net Proceeds”),

(1) to reduce, prepay, repay or purchase:

(a) Obligations with Pari Passu Lien Priority (including the First Lien Credit
Facilities or any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof but other than Indebtedness owed to
ParentCo or any Restricted Subsidiary), and, in the case of revolving obligations, to
correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto, provided that, to the extent ParentCo or
any Restricted Subsidiary will so repay any such Indebtedness (other than the Notes), the Issuers
will reduce Obligations under the Notes on a pro rata basis by, at their option, (i) redeeming Notes
as provided under the caption “Optional Redemption,” (ii) purchasing Notes through open-market
purchases or privately-negotiated transactions or (iii) by making an offer (in accordance with the
procedures set forth herein for an Asset Sale Offer) to all Holders to purchase their Notes at a
purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus the amount of accrued but
unpaid interest, if any, on the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased to the date of
repurchase; or

(b) Obligations in respect of Indebtedness of a Non-Guarantor Subsidiary, other
than Indebtedness owed to ParentCo or another Restricted Subsidiary;

_provided, in the case of clause (a) above, (i) if an offer to purchase any Indebtedness of ParentCo or any_
Restricted Subsidiary is made, such amount will be deemed repaid to the extent of the amount of such
offer, whether or not accepted by the holders of such Indebtedness, and no Applicable Net Proceeds in the
amount of such offer will be deemed to exist following such offer, and (ii) if the holder of any Indebtedness
of ParentCo or a Restricted Subsidiary declines the repayment of such Indebtedness owed to it from such
Applicable Net Proceeds such amount will be deemed repaid to the extent of the declined Applicable Net
Proceeds, or

(2) to make (a) an Investment in any one or more businesses, provided that such Investment
in any business is in the form of the acquisition of Capital Stock that results in ParentCo or any Restricted
Subsidiary, as the case may be, owning an amount of the Capital Stock of such business such that such
business constitutes a Restricted Subsidiary or increases ParentCo’s direct or indirect percentage ownership
of the Capital Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, (b) capital expenditures or (c) acquisitions of other assets,
in the case of each of (a), (b) and (c), used or useful in a Similar Business, or

(3) to make an Investment in (a) any one or more businesses; provided that such Investment
in any business is in the form of the acquisition of Capital Stock that results in ParentCo or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be, owning an amount of the Capital Stock of such business such
that it constitutes a Restricted Subsidiary or increases ParentCo’s direct or indirect percentage ownership of
the Capital Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, (b) properties or (c) acquisitions of other assets that, in the
case of each of (a), (b) and (c), replace the businesses, properties or assets that are the subject of such Asset
Sale of Collateral, or

(4) any combination of the foregoing;

_provided that, in the case of clauses (2) and (3) above, (A) a binding commitment shall be treated as a_
permitted application of the Applicable Net Proceeds from the date of such commitment so long as
ParentCo, or such Restricted Subsidiary, enters into such commitment with the good faith expectation that
such Applicable Net Proceeds will be applied to satisfy such commitment within 180 days of such


-----

commitment (an “Acceptable Commitment”) and, in the event any Acceptable Commitment is later
cancelled or terminated for any reason before the Applicable Net Proceeds are applied in connection
therewith, ParentCo or such Restricted Subsidiary enters into another Acceptable Commitment (a “Second
_Commitment”) within 180 days of such cancellation or termination; provided further that if any Second_
Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before such Applicable Net Proceeds are
applied, then such Applicable Net Proceeds shall constitute Excess Proceeds on the date of such
cancellation or termination, and (B) ParentCo and its Restricted Subsidiaries will be deemed to have made
a permitted application of the Applicable Net Proceeds if and to the extent that ParentCo and/or any
Restricted Subsidiary shall have made such Investments, capital expenditures and/or acquisitions prior to
the date of the consummation of such Asset Sale but following the earlier of notice of and execution of a
definitive agreement for such Asset Sale.

Notwithstanding any other provisions of this covenant, (i) to the extent that any of or all the Net Proceeds
of any Asset Sale of Collateral received or deemed to be received by a Foreign Subsidiary (a “Foreign Disposition”)
is (x) prohibited or delayed by applicable local law, (y) restricted by applicable organizational documents or any
agreement or (z) subject to other onerous organizational or administrative impediments from being repatriated to the
United States, an amount equal to the portion of such Net Proceeds so affected will not be required to be applied in
compliance with this covenant, and such amounts shall not be so applied so long, but only so long, as the applicable
local law, documents or agreements will not permit repatriation to ParentCo’s country of domicile (ParentCo hereby
agrees to use reasonable efforts (as determined in ParentCo’s reasonable business judgment) to otherwise cause the
applicable Foreign Subsidiary to within one year following the date on which the respective payment would
otherwise have been required, promptly take all actions reasonably required by the applicable local law, applicable
organizational impediments or other impediment to permit such repatriation), and if within one year following the
date on which the respective payment would otherwise have been required, such repatriation of any of such affected
Net Proceeds is permitted under the applicable local law, applicable organizational impediment or other
impediment, an amount equal to such Net Proceeds (net of additional taxes that would be payable or reserved
against as a result of such repatriation but only to the extent such taxes do not reduce Net Proceeds pursuant to the
definition thereof) will be promptly (and in any event not later than five Business Days after such repatriation could
be made) applied in compliance with this covenant and (ii) to the extent that ParentCo has determined in good faith
that repatriation of any of or all the Net Proceeds of any Foreign Disposition would have an adverse tax consequence
(which for the avoidance of doubt, includes, but is not limited to, any prepayment out of such Net Proceeds whereby
doing so ParentCo, any of its Subsidiaries, any parent entity or any of their respective affiliates and/or equity owners
would incur a tax liability, including a tax dividend, deemed dividend pursuant to Code Section 956 or a
withholding tax), an amount equal to the Net Proceeds so affected will not be required to be applied in compliance
with this covenant. The non-application of any prepayment amounts as a consequence of the foregoing provisions
will not, for the avoidance of doubt, constitute a Default or an Event of Default.

When the Applicable Net Proceeds from the Asset Sale of Collateral that are not invested or applied as
provided and within the time period set forth in the second preceding paragraph (it being understood that any portion
of such Applicable Net Proceeds used to make an offer to purchase Notes as described in clause (1)(a) or (1)(c)
above will be deemed to have been so applied whether or not such offer is accepted) exceed the greater of (x) $588.8
million and (y) 50% of Consolidated EBITDA for the most recently ended Test Period, calculated on a Pro Forma
Basis (such amount of Applicable Net Proceeds that are in excess of such amount, “Excess Proceeds”), then, subject
to the limitations with respect to Foreign Dispositions set forth above, the Issuers will make an offer (an “Asset Sale
_Offer”) to all Holders of the Notes and, at the option of the Issuers, to any holders of any Pari Passu Indebtedness, to_
purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount of the Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness that is, in the case
of the Notes, in an amount equal to at least $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof that may be
purchased out of the Excess Proceeds at an offer price, in the case of the Notes, in cash in an amount equal to
100.0% of the principal amount thereof (or accreted value thereof in the case of other Pari Passu Indebtedness, if
less), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date fixed for the closing of such offer, in
accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture (and, in respect of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, such
other price, if any, as may be provided for by the terms of such Pari Passu Indebtedness). The Issuers will
commence an Asset Sale Offer with respect to Excess Proceeds within 30 days after the expiration of the Proceeds
Application Period by delivering the notice required pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, with a copy to the
Trustee and the paying agent. The Issuers may, at their option, satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to any
Applicable Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale of Collateral by making an Asset Sale Offer with respect to such Net


-----

Proceeds prior to the expiration of the Proceeds Application Period (the “Advance Offer”) with respect to all or a
part of the Applicable Net Proceeds (the “Advance Portion”) in advance of being required to do so by the Indenture
or with respect to any Declined Excess Proceeds.

To the extent that the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of Notes and such Pari
Passu Indebtedness tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds (or in the case of an
Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Issuers may include any remaining Excess Proceeds (or in the case of an
Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) in Declined Excess Proceeds, and use such Declined Excess Proceeds for any
purpose not otherwise prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value in the case of
other Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable) of Notes or the Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by such holders
thereof exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the
Issuers shall select the Notes (while the Notes are in global form pursuant to the procedures of DTC) and such Pari
Passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis based on the accreted value or aggregate principal amount of
the Notes or such Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered; provided that no Notes will be selected and purchased in an
unauthorized denomination. Upon completion of any such Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds (or in
the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) will be reset to zero. An Asset Sale Offer may be made at the
same time as consents are solicited with respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture, Notes
and/or Guarantees.

Pending the final application of any Applicable Net Proceeds pursuant to this covenant, the holder of such
Applicable Net Proceeds may apply such Applicable Net Proceeds temporarily to reduce Indebtedness outstanding
under a revolving credit facility or otherwise use such Applicable Net Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the
Indenture. ParentCo or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, may elect to invest in ParentCo and its
Subsidiaries prior to receiving the Applicable Net Proceeds attributable to any given Asset Sale of Collateral
(provided that such investment shall be made no earlier than execution of a definitive agreement for the relevant
Asset Sale of Collateral) and deem the amount so invested to be applied pursuant to and in accordance with clauses
(2) or (3) above with respect to such Asset Sale of Collateral.

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the
Indenture, and ParentCo complies with the applicable securities laws and regulations, then ParentCo shall not be
deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof.

The provisions under the Indenture relative to the Issuers’ obligations to make an offer to repurchase the
Notes as a result of an Asset Sale of Collateral may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of
a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.

**Certain Covenants**

Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants contained in the Indenture.

**_Covenant Suspension_**

If on any date following the Completion Date (i) the Notes have Investment Grade Ratings from two Rating
Agencies (“Investment Grade Status”), and (ii) no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under the
Indenture (the occurrence of the events described in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) being collectively referred to as
a “Covenant Suspension Event”), ParentCo and its Restricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to the following
covenants (collectively, the “Suspended Covenants”):

(1) “Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales”;

(2) “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

(3) “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and
Preferred Stock”;


-----

(4) clause (3) of the first paragraph of “—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of All or
Substantially All Assets”;

(5) “—Transactions with Affiliates”;

(6) “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries”; and

(7) “—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries.”

In the event that ParentCo and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants under
the Indenture for any period of time as a result of the foregoing, and on any subsequent date (the “Reversion Date”)
the Notes cease to have such Investment Grade Status, then ParentCo and its Restricted Subsidiaries will thereafter
again be subject to the Suspended Covenants under the Indenture with respect to future events.

The period of time between the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event and the Reversion Date is
referred to in this description as the “Suspension Period.” Additionally, upon the occurrence of a Covenant
Suspension Event, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset to zero.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of any such reinstatement, no action taken or omitted to be
taken by ParentCo or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or events occurring prior to such reinstatement will give rise
to a Default or Event of Default under the Indenture with respect to the Notes; provided that (1) with respect to
Restricted Payments made after any such reinstatement, the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments
will be calculated as though the covenant described under the caption “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” had
been in effect prior to, but not during the Suspension Period, (2) all Indebtedness incurred, or Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock issued, during the Suspension Period will be classified as having been incurred or issued pursuant to
clause (3) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under the caption “—Limitation on Incurrence of
Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock,” (3) no Subsidiaries shall be designated as
Unrestricted Subsidiaries during any Suspension Period, (4) any Affiliate Transaction entered into after the
Reversion Date pursuant to an agreement entered into during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted
pursuant to clause (6) of the covenant described under the caption “—Transactions with Affiliates,” (5) any
encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Non-Guarantor Subsidiary to take any action described in clauses
(1) through (3) of the covenant described under the caption “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting
Restricted Subsidiaries” that becomes effective during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted
pursuant to clause (a) of the covenant described under the caption “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions
Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries” and (6) no Restricted Subsidiary of ParentCo shall be required to comply with the
covenant described under the caption “—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries” after
such reinstatement with respect to any guarantee entered into by such Restricted Subsidiary during any Suspension
Period except that such Restricted Subsidiary shall execute and deliver a supplemental indenture to the Indenture
providing for a Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to the provisions of such covenant to the extent
required and to the extent such Restricted Subsidiary has not already provided a Guarantee. No default or Event of
Default with respect to a Suspended Covenant will be deemed to have occurred on the Reversion Date as a result of
any actions taken by ParentCo or its Restricted Subsidiaries during the Suspension Period.

On and after each Reversion Date, ParentCo and its Subsidiaries will be permitted to consummate the
transactions contemplated by any contract entered into during the Suspension Period, so long as such contract and
such consummation would have been permitted during such Suspension Period.

There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain Investment Grade Ratings.

The Trustee shall have no duty to monitor the ratings of the Notes, determine whether a Covenant
Suspension Event or Reversion Date has occurred or notify Holders of the same.

(24) mandatory redemptions of Disqualified Stock issued as a Restricted Payment or as
consideration for a Permitted Investment; and

(25) any Restricted Payment made in connection with a Permitted Intercompany Activity or

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that a proposed Restricted
Payment (or a portion thereof) meets the criteria of clauses (1) through (25) above or is entitled to be made pursuant
to the first paragraph of this covenant and/or one or more of the clauses contained in the definition of “Permitted
Investments,” ParentCo will be entitled to classify or later reclassify (based on circumstances existing on the date of
such reclassification) such Restricted Payment or Investment (or portion thereof) between such clauses (1) through
(25) and such first paragraph and/or one or more of the clauses contained in the definition of “Permitted
Investments,” in a manner that otherwise complies with this covenant.

We anticipate that, as of the Completion Date, all of ParentCo’s Subsidiaries will be Restricted
Subsidiaries. ParentCo will not permit any Unrestricted Subsidiary to become a Restricted Subsidiary except
pursuant to the last sentence of the definition of “Unrestricted Subsidiary.” For purposes of designating any
Restricted Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, all outstanding Investments by ParentCo and its Restricted
Subsidiaries (except to the extent repaid) in the Subsidiary so designated will be deemed to be Restricted Payments
in an amount determined as set forth in the last sentence of the definition of “Investment.” If such Subsidiary so
designated has consolidated assets greater than $1,000, then such designation will be permitted only if a Restricted
Payment and/or Permitted Investment in such amount would be permitted at such time, and if such Subsidiary
otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary. Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of
the restrictive covenants set forth in the Indenture.

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) shall be the fair market value on the date of such
Restricted Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be paid, transferred or issued by ParentCo or such
Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to such Restricted Payment. The fair market value of any cash
Restricted Payment shall be its face amount, and the fair market value of any non-cash Restricted Payment, property
or assets other than cash shall be determined conclusively by ParentCo acting in good faith.


-----

Unrestricted Subsidiaries may use value transferred from ParentCo and its Restricted Subsidiaries in a
Permitted Investment to purchase or otherwise acquire Indebtedness or Equity Interests of ParentCo, any director or
indirect parent of ParentCo or any of ParentCo’s Restricted Subsidiaries, and to transfer value to the holders of the
Equity Interests or any director or indirect parent of ParentCo and to Affiliates thereof.

In connection with any commitment, definitive agreement or similar event relating to an Investment,
ParentCo or applicable Restricted Subsidiary may designate such Investment as having occurred on the date of the
commitment, definitive agreement or similar event relating thereto (such date, the “Election Date”) if, after giving
Pro Forma Effect to such Investment and all related transactions in connection therewith and any related Pro Forma
Adjustments, ParentCo or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been permitted to make such Investment on
the relevant Election Date in compliance with the Indenture, and any related subsequent actual making of such
Investment will be deemed for all purposes under the Indenture to have been made on such Election Date, including
for purposes of the calculation of any ratio, compliance with any test, usage of any baskets hereunder (if applicable)
and the calculation of Consolidated EBITDA and for purposes of determining whether there exists any Default or
Event of Default (and all such calculations on and after the Election Date until the termination, expiration, passing,
rescission, retraction or rescindment of such commitment, definitive agreement or similar event shall be made on a
Pro Forma Basis giving effect thereto and all related transactions in connection therewith).

If ParentCo or a Restricted Subsidiary makes a Restricted Payment which at the time of the making of such
Restricted Payment would in the good faith determination of ParentCo not be prohibited under the provisions of the
Indenture, such Restricted Payment shall be deemed to have been made in compliance with the Indenture
notwithstanding any subsequent adjustments made in good faith to ParentCo’s financial statements affecting
Consolidated Net Income or Consolidated EBITDA of ParentCo for any period.

**_Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock_**

ParentCo will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, create, incur, issue, assume,
guarantee or otherwise become liable, contingently or otherwise (collectively, “incur” and collectively, an

shares of Disqualified Stock and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to issue any shares of Disqualified Stock
or Preferred Stock; provided, however, that ParentCo may incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) or
issue shares of Disqualified Stock, and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries may incur Indebtedness (including
Acquired Indebtedness), issue shares of Disqualified Stock and issue shares of Preferred Stock, if either (A) the

deemed to have a principal amount equal to the face amount thereof); provided that, immediately after
giving effect to any such incurrence, the aggregate principal amount of all Indebtedness incurred under this
clause (1) and outstanding at any one time does not exceed the sum of (a) $4,525.0 million plus (b) the
greater of (i) $1,177.6 million and (ii) 100% of Consolidated EBITDA for the most recently ended Test

Period, calculated on a Pro Forma Basis, plus (c) (i) if such Indebtedness incurred has Pari Passu Lien
Priority relative to the Notes, at the time of such incurrence, an amount equal to the maximum principal
amount of Indebtedness that could be incurred such that after giving effect to the incurrence of such
Indebtedness, and the use of proceeds thereof, on a Pro Forma Basis, the Senior Secured First Lien Net
Leverage Ratio of ParentCo for the most recently ended Test Period as of such date would not exceed the
greater of (A) 5.25 to 1.00 and (B) the Senior Secured First Lien Net Leverage Ratio immediately prior to
such incurrence or issuance, or (ii) if such Indebtedness incurred has Junior Lien Priority relative to the
Notes, at the time of such incurrence, an amount equal to the maximum principal amount of Secured
Indebtedness that could be incurred such that after giving effect to the incurrence of such Indebtedness, and
the use of proceeds thereof, on a Pro Forma Basis, the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio of ParentCo for
the most recently ended Test Period as of such date would not exceed the greater of (I) 6.75 to 1.00 (or, in
the case of any such Indebtedness secured by the Collateral on a junior basis to the loans made pursuant to
the Second Lien Credit Facility, 7.00 to 1.00) or (II) the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio immediately
prior to such incurrence or issuance; provided that for purposes of determining the amount that may be

be included in clause (1) of the definition of “Senior Secured First Lien Net Leverage Ratio” and “Senior
Secured Net Leverage Ratio,” respectively;

Notes issued on the Issue Date and any replacement Notes therefor (including any Guarantee thereof)

(36) all premiums (if any), interest (including post-petition interest), fees, expenses, charges

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant:

(1) in the event that an item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any
portion thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of permitted Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock described in clauses (1) through (36) above or is entitled to be
incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, ParentCo, in its sole discretion, will classify or
reclassify such item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) and
will only be required to include the amount and type of such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred
Stock in one of the above clauses or under the first paragraph of this covenant; provided that all
Indebtedness outstanding under the Credit Facilities on the Completion Date will be treated as incurred on
the Completion Date under clause (1) of the preceding paragraph;

(2) at the time of incurrence or reclassification, ParentCo will be entitled to divide and
classify or reclassify an item of Indebtedness in more than one of the types of Indebtedness described in the
first and second paragraphs above (it being understood that any Indebtedness incurred pursuant to one of
the clauses of the second paragraph of this covenant shall cease to be deemed incurred or outstanding for
purposes of such clause but shall be deemed incurred for the purposes of the first paragraph of this
covenant from and after the first date on which ParentCo or its Restricted Subsidiaries could have incurred
such Indebtedness under the first paragraph of this covenant without reliance on such clause);

(3) in the event that ParentCo or a Restricted Subsidiary enters into or increases
commitments under a credit facility, the Interest Coverage Ratio, the Senior Secured First Lien Net
Leverage Ratio, the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Total Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, for
borrowings and reborrowings thereunder (and including issuance and creation of letters of credit and
bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will be determined on the date of such credit facility or such increase in
commitments (assuming that the full amount thereof has been borrowed as of such date), and, if such
Interest Coverage Ratio, Senior Secured First Lien Net Leverage Ratio, Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio
or Total Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, test is satisfied with respect thereto at such time, any borrowing
or reborrowing thereunder (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances
thereunder) will be permitted under this covenant irrespective of the Interest Coverage Ratio, Senior
Secured First Lien Net Leverage Ratio, Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio or Total Net Leverage Ratio, as
applicable, at the time of any borrowing or reborrowing (or issuance or creation of letters of credit or
bankers’ acceptances thereunder);


-----

(4) accrual of interest or dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or
amortization of original issue discount and the payment of interest or dividends in the form of additional
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, as the case may be, of the same class will not be
deemed to be an incurrence or issuance of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock for purposes
of this covenant and, for the avoidance of doubt, will not require use of any basket capacity relating to such
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock;

(5) for purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on
the incurrence of Indebtedness, the U.S. dollar-equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in
a foreign currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date
such Indebtedness was incurred, in the case of term debt, or first committed, in the case of revolving credit
debt; provided that if such Indebtedness is incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a
foreign currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable U.S. dollar-denominated restriction to be
exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such
U.S. dollar-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal
amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed (i) the principal amount of such Indebtedness
being refinanced plus (ii) the aggregate amount of fees, underwriting discounts, premiums and other costs
and expenses incurred in connection with such refinancing;

(6) the principal amount of any Indebtedness incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if
incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the
currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such respective Indebtedness is denominated
that is in effect on the date of such refinancing;

(7) in the case of any refinancing of any Indebtedness or any portion thereof, the amount of
Indebtedness being incurred to finance the aggregate amount of accrued and unpaid interest, dividends,
premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance costs and fees and expenses (including original issue
discount, upfront fees or similar fees) in connection with such refinancing will not be deemed to be an
incurrence or issuance of Indebtedness for purposes of this covenant, and the principal amount of any
Disqualified Stock of ParentCo or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary,
will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption or repurchase price (not including, in
either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the liquidation preference thereof;

(8) notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any Indebtedness
incurred to refinance Indebtedness initially incurred in reliance on the first and/or second paragraph of this
covenant, measured by reference to a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA at the time of incurrence, and
such refinancing would cause the percentage of Consolidated EBITDA restriction to be exceeded if
calculated based on the percentage of Consolidated EBITDA on the date of such refinancing, such
percentage of Consolidated EBITDA restriction shall not be deemed to be exceeded so long as the principal
amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being
refinanced, plus accrued and unpaid interest, dividends, premiums (including tender premiums),
defeasance, costs and fees and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) in
connection with such refinancing;

(9) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other
similar instruments relating to, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the determination of a particular
amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;

(10) the Indenture will not treat (x) unsecured Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to
Secured Indebtedness merely because it is unsecured or (y) Senior Indebtedness as subordinated or junior
to any other Senior Indebtedness merely because it has a junior priority with respect to the same collateral
or is secured by different collateral or because it is guaranteed by different obligors; and

(11) when calculating the availability under any basket or ratio under the Indenture or
compliance with any provision of the Indenture in connection with any Limited Condition Transaction and
any actions or transactions related thereto (including acquisitions, Investments, the incurrence, issuance or


-----

assumption of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof, the incurrence or creation of Liens,
repayments, Restricted Payments and Asset Sales), in each case, at the option of ParentCo (ParentCo’s
election to exercise such option, an “LCT Election”), the date of determination for availability under any
such basket or ratio and whether any such action or transaction is permitted (or any requirement or
condition therefor is complied with or satisfied (including as to the absence of any continuing Default or
Event of Default)) under the Indenture shall be deemed to be the date (the “LCT Test Date”) either (a) the
definitive agreement for such Limited Condition Transaction is entered into (or, if applicable, the date of
delivery of an irrevocable declaration of a Restricted Payment or similar event), or (b) in connection with
an acquisition to which the United Kingdom City Code on Takeovers and Mergers (or an analogous law)
applies, the date on which a “Rule 2.7 announcement” of a firm intention to make an offer (or equivalent
announcement in another jurisdiction) (an “LCT Public Offer”) in respect of a target of a Limited
Condition Transaction and, in each case, if, after giving Pro Forma Effect to the Limited Condition
Transaction and any actions or transactions related thereto (including acquisitions, Investments, the
incurrence, issuance or assumption of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof, the incurrence or
creation of Liens, repayments, Restricted Payments and Asset Sales) and any related Pro Forma
Adjustments, ParentCo or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been permitted to take such actions
or consummate such transactions on the relevant LCT Test Date in compliance with such ratio, test or
basket (and any related requirements and conditions), such ratio, test or basket (and any related
requirements and conditions) shall be deemed to have been complied with (or satisfied) for all purposes (in
the case of Indebtedness, for example, whether such Indebtedness is committed, issued, assumed or
incurred at the LCT Test Date or at any time thereafter); provided, that (a) if financial statements for one or
more subsequent fiscal quarters shall have become available, ParentCo may elect, in its sole discretion, to
redetermine all such ratios, tests or baskets on the basis of such financial statements, in which case, such
date of redetermination shall thereafter be the applicable LCT Test Date for purposes of such ratios, tests or
baskets, (b) except as contemplated in the foregoing clause (a), compliance with such ratios, test or baskets
(and any related requirements and conditions) shall not be determined or tested at any time after the
applicable LCT Test Date for such Limited Condition Transaction and any actions or transaction related
thereto (including acquisitions, Investments, the incurrence, issuance or assumption of Indebtedness and the
use of proceeds thereof, the incurrence or creation of Liens, repayments, Restricted Payments and Asset
Sales) and (c) Consolidated Cash Interest Expense for purposes of the Interest Coverage Ratio will be
calculated using an assumed interest rate as reasonably determined by ParentCo.

For the avoidance of doubt, if ParentCo has made an LCT Election, (1) if any of the ratios, tests or baskets
for which compliance was determined or tested as of the LCT Test Date would at any time after the LCT Test Date
have been exceeded or otherwise failed to have been complied with as a result of fluctuations in any such ratio, test
or basket, including due to fluctuations in Consolidated EBITDA or Total Assets of ParentCo or the Person subject
to such Limited Condition Transaction, such baskets, tests or ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded or
failed to have been complied with as a result of such fluctuations; (2) if any related requirements and conditions
(including as to the absence of any continuing Default or Event of Default) for which compliance or satisfaction was
determined or tested as of the LCT Test Date would at any time after the LCT Test Date not have been complied
with or satisfied (including due to the occurrence or continuation of an Default or Event of Default), such
requirements and conditions will not be deemed to have been failed to be complied with or satisfied (and such
Default or Event of Default shall be deemed not to have occurred or be continuing); and (3) in calculating the
availability under any ratio, test or basket in connection with any action or transaction unrelated to such Limited
Condition Transaction following the relevant LCT Test Date and prior to the earlier of the date on which such
Limited Condition Transaction is consummated or the date that the definitive agreement or date for redemption,
purchase or repayment specified in an irrevocable notice for such Limited Condition Transaction is terminated,
expires or passes (or, if applicable, the irrevocable notice is terminated, expires or passes or, as applicable, the offer
in respect of an LCT Public Offer for, such acquisition is terminated), as applicable, without consummation of such
Limited Condition Transaction, any such ratio, test or basket shall be determined or tested giving Pro Forma Effect
to such Limited Condition Transaction.

**_Liens_**

ParentCo will not, and will not permit any Issuer or Subsidiary Guarantor to, create, incur, assume or
permit to exist any Lien upon any property or assets of any kind (real or personal, tangible or intangible) of


-----

ParentCo or any Subsidiary Guarantor, whether now owned or hereafter acquired (each, an “Initial Lien”) that
secures Obligations under any Indebtedness on any asset or property of ParentCo, any Issuer or any Subsidiary
Guarantor, unless:

(1) in the case of any Initial Lien on any Collateral, (i) such Initial Lien expressly has Junior
Lien Priority on the Collateral relative to the Notes and related Guarantees or (ii) such Initial Lien is a
Permitted Lien; or

(2) in the case of any Initial Lien on any asset or property that is not Collateral, (i) the Notes
or the Guarantees are equally and ratably secured with (or on a senior basis to, in the case such Initial Lien
secures any Subordinated Indebtedness) the Obligations secured by such Initial Lien or (ii) such Initial Lien
is a Permitted Lien, except that the foregoing shall not apply to Liens securing the Notes and the related
Guarantees.

Any Lien created for the benefit of Holders of the Notes in respect of property, assets or proceeds that do
not constitute Collateral pursuant to this covenant shall provide by its terms that such Lien will be automatically and
unconditionally released and discharged upon the release and discharge of the Initial Lien.

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the time
of the incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount of such
Indebtedness; provided that such Increased Amount shall not require utilization of any additional basket capacity
relating to such Lien. The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount of such
Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the amortization of original
issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms, accretion of
original issue discount or liquidation preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a
result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies or increases in the value of property securing Indebtedness.

understood that a release subject to a contingent reinstatement is still considered a release, and if any such
Guarantee or obligations of such Issuer under the Senior Credit Facilities is so reinstated, such obligations
shall also be reinstated), or (y) a refinancing or replacement in full of the Senior Credit Facilities; or

(d) the designation of such Issuer as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in compliance with the
applicable provisions of the Indenture or the occurrence of any event after which such Issuer is no longer a
Wholly Owned Subsidiary of ParentCo in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture,

in each case provided that ParentCo or at least one Restricted Subsidiary of ParentCo is an Issuer under the
Indenture.

The Indenture will provide that notwithstanding any other provision therein, (i) ParentCo or any Restricted
Subsidiary of ParentCo may by supplemental indenture become an Issuer under the Notes Documents or assume the
obligations of any existing Issuer under the Notes Documents and the applicable Issuer’s obligations under the
Notes Documents will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged and (ii) any Issuer may by
supplemental indenture become a Guarantor under the Notes Documents and the applicable Issuer’s obligations
under the Notes Documents as an Issuer will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged,
provided in the case of this clause (ii) that ParentCo or at least one Restricted Subsidiary of ParentCo is an Issuer
under the Indenture.

_The Subsidiary Guarantors_

Subject to certain limitations described in the Indenture governing release of a Guarantee upon the sale,
disposition or transfer of a Guarantor and the other provisions of the section entitled “Merger, Consolidation or Sale
of All or Substantially All Assets”, no Subsidiary Guarantor will, and ParentCo will not permit any Subsidiary
Guarantor to, consolidate, amalgamate or merge with or into or wind up into (whether or not such Subsidiary
Guarantor is the surviving corporation), or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or
substantially all of its properties or assets taken as a whole, in one or more related transactions, to any Person (other
than an Issuer or a Guarantor) unless:


-----

(1) (a) any Guarantor is the surviving Person or the Person formed by or surviving any such
consolidation, amalgamation or merger (if other than such Subsidiary Guarantor) or to which such sale,
assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition will have been made (such surviving Guarantor
or such Person, as the case may be, being herein called the “Successor Person”) expressly assumes all the
obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor under the Collateral Documents, Indenture and such Subsidiary
Guarantor’s related Guarantee pursuant to supplemental indentures or other documents or instruments;

(b) immediately after such transaction, no Event of Default exists; and

(c) the Issuers shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an
Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such consolidation, amalgamation, merger or transfer and
such supplemental indentures, if any, comply with the Indenture;

(d) to the extent any assets of the Person which is merged, consolidated or
amalgamated with or into such Subsidiary Guarantor are assets of the type which would constitute
Collateral under the Collateral Documents, such Subsidiary Guarantor or the Successor Person
will take such action, if any, as may be reasonably necessary to cause such property and assets to
be made subject to the Lien of the applicable Collateral Documents in the manner and to the extent
required in the Indenture or the applicable Collateral Documents and shall take all reasonably
necessary action so that such Lien is perfected to the extent required by the applicable Collateral
Documents; or

(2) with respect to the Subsidiary Guarantors, the transaction is not prohibited by the first
paragraph of the covenant described under the caption “Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset
Sales.”

Subject to certain limitations described in the Collateral Documents and the Indenture, the Successor
Person will succeed to, and be substituted for, such Subsidiary Guarantor under the Collateral Documents, the
Indenture and such Subsidiary Guarantor’s Guarantee and such Subsidiary Guarantor’s obligations under the
Collateral Documents, the Indenture and its Guarantee will be automatically and unconditionally released and
discharged.

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of the section entitled “Merger, Consolidation or Sale of All or
Substantially All Assets”,

(1) an Issuer may transfer all or part of its property or assets to a Guarantor;

(2) an Issuer may merge with one of its Affiliates solely for the purpose of reincorporating in
the United States, the District of Columbia or any territory thereof so long as the amount of Indebtedness of
ParentCo and its Restricted Subsidiaries is not increased thereby;

(3) any Guarantor may (i) consolidate or amalgamate with or merge into, wind up into or
transfer all or part of its properties and assets to an Issuer or a Guarantor (or to a Restricted Subsidiary if
that Restricted Subsidiary becomes a Guarantor), (ii) merge with an Affiliate of an Issuer solely for the
purpose of reincorporating or reorganizing the Guarantor in the United States, any state thereof, the District
of Columbia or any territory thereof, (iii) convert into a corporation, partnership, limited partnership,
limited liability corporation or trust organized or existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of such
Guarantor or (iv) consolidate or amalgamate with or merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and
assets to a Non-Guarantor Subsidiary so long as (A) to the extent constituting an Investment, such
Investment is otherwise not prohibited under the covenant described under the caption “— Limitation on
Restricted Payments” or (B) to the extent constituting an Asset Sale, such Asset Sale is for fair market
value (as determined by ParentCo) and any promissory note or other non-cash consideration received in
respect thereof is a permitted Investment in a Non-Guarantor Subsidiary in accordance with the covenant
described under the caption “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;


-----

(4) any Restricted Subsidiary may effect a merger, dissolution, liquidation, consolidation or
amalgamation to effect (i) a disposition or issuance excluded from the definition of Asset Sale or an Asset
Sale permitted by the covenant described under the caption “Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset
Sales” or (ii) an Investment not prohibited by the covenant described under the caption “—Limitation on
Restricted Payments,” provided that the continuing or surviving Person shall be ParentCo or a Restricted
Subsidiary.

(5) any Restricted Subsidiary may merge or consolidate with (A) ParentCo or an Issuer;
provided that ParentCo or such Issuer shall be the continuing or surviving Person, or (B) any one or more
Restricted Subsidiaries; provided that when any Issuer or Subsidiary Guarantor is merging or consolidating
with another Restricted Subsidiary (1) the continuing or surviving Person shall be ParentCo, an Issuer or a
Subsidiary Guarantor or (2) if the continuing or surviving Person is not ParentCo, an Issuer or a Subsidiary
Guarantor, the acquisition of such Issuer or Subsidiary Guarantor by such surviving Restricted Subsidiary
is otherwise not prohibited by the covenant under this section entitled “Merger, Consolidation or Sale of
All or Substantially All Assets”;

(6) any Non-Guarantor Subsidiary may consolidate or amalgamate with or merge into or
transfer all or part of its properties and assets to ParentCo or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(7) ParentCo and the Restricted Subsidiaries may consummate the Transactions;

(8) the Transactions will be permitted without compliance with this “Merger, Consolidation
or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets” covenant; and

(9) ParentCo may effect a merger, dissolution, liquidation, consolidation or amalgamation to
effect any Holdings Termination Event.

**_Holdings Covenant_**

Holdings will not, and will not permit any Intermediate Parent to, conduct, transact or otherwise engage in
any business or operations other than (i) the ownership and/or acquisition of the Equity Interests of ParentCo, any

incur fees, costs and expenses relating to such maintenance, (iii) participating in tax, accounting and other
administrative matters as a member of the consolidated group of Holdings and its subsidiaries, (iv) the performance
of its obligations under and in connection with the Senior Credit Facilities any documentation governing any
Indebtedness or Guarantee and the other agreements contemplated hereby and thereby, (v) any public offering of its
or any of its direct or indirect parent’s common stock or any other issuance or registration of its Equity Interests for
sale or resale not prohibited by this Agreement, including the costs, fees and expenses related thereto, (vi) making
any dividend or distribution or other transaction similar to a Restricted Payment and not otherwise prohibited by the

Intermediate Parent or any other Subsidiary (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the acquisition thereof), (vii) the
incurrence of any Indebtedness, (viii) incurring fees, costs and expenses relating to overhead and general operating
including professional fees for legal, tax and accounting issues and paying taxes, (ix) providing indemnification to

than Equity Interests as referred to in paragraph (b)(i) and/or (vi) above, cash and Cash Equivalents, intercompany
Investments in any Intermediate Parent, ParentCo or any Subsidiary not prohibited under the Indenture) or incur any
liabilities (other than liabilities as referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph, liabilities imposed by law,
including tax liabilities, and other liabilities incidental to its existence and business and activities not prohibited by
the Indenture).


-----

After an IPO of ParentCo, at the option of ParentCo (the exercising of such option to release Holdings from
its obligations under the Indenture and Notes pursuant to this clause, a “Holdings Termination Event”), but only if,
upon giving effect to such IPO and through a series of mergers, consolidations, dissolutions, amalgamations or
otherwise, ParentCo would cease to have a direct or indirect parent entity of Initial Holdings or an Intermediate
Parent that owns all of the Capital Stock of ParentCo, Holdings shall be automatically and unconditionally released
from its Guarantee and all of its property (including the Capital Stock of ParentCo) released as Collateral
automatically and unconditionally, and Holdings shall be automatically and unconditionally released from all
obligations under the Indenture and the Notes Documents, including with respect to all covenants and defaults
related to or referencing Holdings; provided, that, following such Holdings Termination Event, Holdings does not
otherwise guarantee any Indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facilities. Following any such release, the Indenture
and the Notes Documents shall be deemed to be amended to eliminate or modify all references to Holdings, as
applicable.

**_Transactions with Affiliates_**

ParentCo will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, enter into or make or amend any
transaction, contract, agreement, understanding, loan, advance or guarantee with, any Affiliate of ParentCo (each of
the foregoing, an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate payments or consideration in excess of the greater of
$294.4 million and 25% of Consolidated EBITDA for the most recently ended Test Period as of such date,
calculated on a Pro Forma Basis, at the time of such Affiliate Transaction, unless such Affiliate Transaction is on
terms that are not materially less favorable to ParentCo or its relevant Restricted Subsidiary than those that would
have been obtained in a comparable transaction by ParentCo or such Restricted Subsidiary with an unrelated Person
on an arm’s-length basis; provided, any Affiliate Transaction shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirements set
forth in this paragraph if (x) such Affiliate Transaction is approved by a majority of the Disinterested Directors or

deliver to the Trustee a letter from an Independent Financial Advisor stating that such transaction is fair to

been obtained in a comparable transaction by ParentCo or such Restricted Subsidiary with an unrelated
Person on an arm’s-length basis;

(6) any agreement or arrangement as in effect as of the Completion Date, or any amendment
thereto or replacement thereof (so long as any such amendment or replacement is not disadvantageous in

shall be conclusive)), including the transactions and payments pursuant to the Investor Expense

future amendment to any such existing agreement or under any similar agreement entered into after the

agreement together with all amendments thereto are not otherwise disadvantageous in any material respect

**_Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries_**

ParentCo will not, and will not permit any of its Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly,

extensions, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings,

those prior to such amendment, modification, restatement, renewal, increase, supplement,
refunding, replacement or refinancing.

**_Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries_**

ParentCo will not permit any of its Wholly Owned Subsidiaries (and non-Wholly Owned Subsidiaries if
such non-Wholly Owned Subsidiaries guarantee, or are a co-issuer of, other capital markets debt securities of
ParentCo or any Restricted Subsidiary in a principal amount in excess of the greater of $177.76 million and 10% of
Consolidated EBITDA for the most recently ended Test Period, calculated on a Pro Forma Basis, or guarantee all or
a portion of, or are a co-borrower under, the Senior Credit Facilities) that are Restricted Subsidiaries, other than a
Guarantor, a Receivables/Securitization Subsidiary or a Foreign Subsidiary, to guarantee the payment of any
Indebtedness of an Issuer or any Guarantor, unless such Restricted Subsidiary within 90 days (i) executes and
delivers a supplemental indenture to the Indenture providing for a Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary, except
that with respect to a guarantee of Indebtedness of an Issuer or any Guarantor, if such Indebtedness is by its express
terms subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or such Guarantor’s Guarantee, any such guarantee by such
Restricted Subsidiary with respect to such Indebtedness shall be subordinated in right of payment to such Guarantee
substantially to the same extent as such Indebtedness is subordinated to the Notes or such Guarantor’s Guarantee of
the Notes and (ii) executes and delivers a supplement or joinder to the Collateral Documents or new Collateral
Documents and takes all actions required thereunder to perfect the Liens created thereunder; provided that if such
Indebtedness is by its express terms subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or such Guarantor’s Guarantee,
any such guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary with respect to such Indebtedness shall be subordinated in right of
payment to such Guarantee with respect to the Notes substantially to the same extent as such Indebtedness is
subordinated to the Notes or such Guarantor’s Guarantee of the Notes; provided that this covenant shall not be
applicable (i) to any guarantee of any Restricted Subsidiary that existed at the time such Person became a Restricted
Subsidiary and was not incurred in connection with, or in contemplation of, such Person becoming a Restricted
Subsidiary, (ii) guarantees of any Receivables/Securitization Facility by any Receivables/Securitization Subsidiary,
or (iii) in the event that the Guarantee of the Issuers’ obligations under the Notes or the Indenture by such Subsidiary
would not be permitted under applicable law.

ParentCo may elect, in its sole discretion, to cause any Subsidiary or Parent Entity that is not otherwise
required to be a Guarantor to become a Guarantor, in which case, such Subsidiary or Parent Entity shall not be
required to comply with the periods described above and such Guarantee may be released at any time in ParentCo’s
sole discretion so long as, in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Restricted Subsidiary then
outstanding could have been incurred by such Restricted Subsidiary (either (x) when so incurred or (y) at the time of
the release of such Guarantee) assuming such Restricted Subsidiary were not a Guarantor at such time.

If any Guarantor becomes an Immaterial Subsidiary, the Issuers shall have the right, by delivery of a
supplemental indenture executed by the Issuers to the Trustee, to cause such Immaterial Subsidiary to automatically
and unconditionally cease to be a Guarantor, subject to the requirement described in the first paragraph above that
such Subsidiary shall be required to become a Guarantor if it ceases to be an Immaterial Subsidiary (except that if
such Subsidiary has been properly designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary it shall not be so required to become a
Guarantor or execute a supplemental indenture); provided, further, that such Immaterial Subsidiary shall not be
permitted to Guarantee the Senior Credit Facilities or other Indebtedness of the Issuers or the other Guarantors,
unless it again becomes a Guarantor to the extent required by the first paragraph above.

**_Reports and Other Information_**

The Indenture will provide that so long as any Notes are outstanding, ParentCo shall furnish to the Trustee:

(i) within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year of ParentCo ending after the Completion
Date (or, in the case of financial statements for (i) the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024 or (ii) any


-----

fiscal year during which either (x) ParentCo or any Subsidiary has consummated a material (in the good
faith judgment of management of ParentCo) acquisition or other Investment or (y) a material (in the good
faith judgment of management of ParentCo) accounting change has occurred, on or before the date that is
150 days after the end of such fiscal year), or, in each case, such longer period as would be permitted by the
SEC if ParentCo were then subject to SEC reporting requirements as a non-accelerated filer, the
consolidated financial statements of ParentCo for such year prepared in accordance with GAAP, together
with a report thereon by ParentCo’s independent auditors, and a “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” with respect to such financial statements substantially
similar to that which would be included in an Annual Report on Form 10-K (as in effect on the Completion
Date, but only to the extent similar information is included in this Offering Memorandum) filed with the
SEC by ParentCo (if ParentCo were required to prepare and file such form); it being understood that
ParentCo shall not be required to include any consolidating financial information with respect to the
Issuers, any Guarantor or any other affiliate of ParentCo, or any separate financial statements or
information for the Issuers, any Guarantor or any other Affiliate of ParentCo;

(ii) within 60 days after the end of each of the first three fiscal quarters in each fiscal year of
ParentCo (or, in the case of financial statements for (i) the fiscal quarters ending March 31, 2024, June 30,
2024 and September 30, 2024 or (ii) any fiscal quarter (and the two immediately subsequent fiscal quarters)
during which either (x) ParentCo or any Subsidiary has consummated a material (in the good faith
judgment of management of ParentCo) acquisition or similar Investment or (y) a material (in the good faith
judgment of management of ParentCo) accounting change has occurred, on or before the date that is 90
days after the end of such fiscal quarter) or, in each case, such longer period as would be permitted by the
SEC if ParentCo were then subject to SEC reporting requirements as a non-accelerated filer, beginning
with the first such fiscal quarter ending after the Completion Date, the condensed consolidated financial
statements of ParentCo for such quarter prepared in accordance with GAAP, together with a
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” with respect to
such financial statements substantially similar to that which would be included in a Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q (as in effect on the Completion Date) filed with the SEC by ParentCo (if ParentCo were
required to prepare and file such form); it being understood that ParentCo shall not be required to include
any consolidating financial information with respect to the Issuers, any Guarantor or any other affiliate of
ParentCo, or any separate financial statements or information for the Issuers, any Guarantor or any other
Affiliate of ParentCo; and

(iii) information substantially similar to the information that would be required to be included
in a Current Report on Form 8-K (as in effect on the Completion Date) filed with the SEC by ParentCo (if
ParentCo were required to prepare and file such form) pursuant to Item 1.01 (Entry into a Material
Definitive Agreement), Item 1.02 (Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement), Item 1.03
(Bankruptcy or Receivership), Item 2.01 (Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets), Item 2.05
(Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities), Item 2.06 (Material Impairments), Item 4.01 (Changes
in Registrant’s Certifying Accountants), Item 4.02 (Non-Reliance on Previously Issued Financial
Statements or a Related Audit Report or Completed Interim Review), Item 5.01 (Changes in Control of
Registrant) or Items 5.02(b) and (c) (Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors;
Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers) of such form, within 15
days after the date of filing that would have been required for a Current Report on Form 8-K; provided,
_however, that no report shall be required to include (1) any information regarding the occurrence of any of_
the foregoing events if ParentCo determines in its reasonable determination that such event that would
otherwise be required to be disclosed is not material to the Holders or the business, assets, operations,
financial positions or prospects of ParentCo and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole, (2) copies of
any agreements, financial statements or other items that would be required to be filed as exhibits to a
Current Report on Form 8-K (other than agreements evidencing material Indebtedness), (3) an exhibit or a
summary of the terms of any employment or compensatory arrangement, agreement, plan or understanding
between ParentCo (or any of its Subsidiaries) and any director, manager or executive officer of ParentCo
(or any of its Subsidiaries) or (4) any trade secrets, privileged or confidential information obtained from
another Person and competitively sensitive information.


-----

In addition, to the extent not satisfied by the foregoing, for so long as the Notes remain subject to this
covenant, ParentCo will furnish to Holders thereof and prospective investors in such Notes, upon their request, the
information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) (as in effect on the Completion Date) of the
Securities Act.

ParentCo shall not be required to provide (i) segment reporting and disclosure (including any required by
FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 280) (provided, however, that for so long as ParentCo has the
reporting segments disclosed in the most recent audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in
the Offering Memorandum, ParentCo will provide segment reporting and disclosure consistent in all material
respects with the most recent audited financial statements and the related “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included or incorporated by reference in the Offering
Memorandum, in each case (A) subject to any changes required by GAAP and (B) excluding any information
ParentCo determines in its reasonable determination is not material to the Holders or the business, assets, operations,
financial positions or prospects of ParentCo and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole), (ii) separate financial
statements or other information contemplated by Rules 3-05, 3-09, 3-10, 4-08, 13-01 or 13-02 of Regulation S-X (or
any successor provisions) or any schedules required by Regulation S-X, (iii) information required by Regulation G
under the Exchange Act or Item 10, Item 302, Item 402 or Item 601 of Regulation S-K (or any successor provision),
(iv) XBRL exhibits, (v) earnings per share information, (vi) information regarding executive compensation and
related party disclosure related to SEC Release Nos. 33-8732A, 34-54302A and IC-27444A or (vii) other
information customarily excluded from an offering memorandum, including any information that is not otherwise of
the type and form currently included or incorporated by reference in the Offering Memorandum. In addition, none of
the reports referenced in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above will be required to comply with Section 302 or Section 404
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or related Items 307 and 308 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC, or
Item 302 of Regulation S-K or Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K or Item 601 of Regulation S-K (with respect to
exhibits), in each case, as in effect on the date of the Indenture.

The requirements set forth in the preceding paragraphs may be satisfied by (i) delivering such information
electronically to the Trustee and (ii) posting copies of such information on its website or on IntraLinks or any
comparable online data system or website (which may be nonpublic, require a confidentiality acknowledgment and
may be maintained by ParentCo or a third party) to which access will be given to Holders, bona fide prospective
investors in the Notes (which prospective investors shall be limited to “qualified institutional buyers” within the
meaning of Rule 144A of the Securities Act or non-U.S. persons (as defined in Regulation S under the Securities
Act) that certify their status as such to the reasonable satisfaction of ParentCo), securities analysts (to the extent
providing analysis of an investment in the Notes) and market making financial institutions that are reasonably
satisfactory to ParentCo who agree to treat such information and reports as confidential; provided that ParentCo may
deny access to any competitively-sensitive information and reports otherwise to be provided pursuant to this
paragraph to any Holder, bona fide prospective investors, security analyst or market maker that is a competitor of
ParentCo and its Subsidiaries to the extent that ParentCo determines in good faith that the provision of such
information and reports to such Person would be competitively harmful to ParentCo and its Subsidiaries. ParentCo
will use commercially reasonable efforts to schedule a conference call to be held not more than 15 Business Days
following the release of each report containing the financial information referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) of the first
paragraph of this covenant, at which ParentCo will make available its senior management to discuss the information
contained in such report on such conference call; provided that such conference calls shall be permitted to be held
jointly with conference calls ParentCo holds for holders of its other Indebtedness. ParentCo will notify Holders of
Notes about such call and provide them and prospective investors in the Notes with call-in information concurrently
with and in the same manner as each delivery of financial statements.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, at all times that ParentCo is subject to the reporting requirements of Section
13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, ParentCo may satisfy the requirements of this covenant by filing with the SEC
within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and regulations that are then applicable to ParentCo all the
reports and information described in the preceding paragraphs, but without giving effect to any of the provisos
contained in such paragraphs, and any other information, documents and other reports that ParentCo would be
required to file with the SEC if it were subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, in each case in a manner
that complies in all material respects with the requirements specified in the applicable forms promulgated by the
SEC.


-----

In the event that any direct or indirect parent company of ParentCo guarantees the Notes (which shall be
permitted, subject to compliance with the Indenture, at any time, at ParentCo’s sole discretion) or files the reports
specified in the first paragraph of this covenant with the SEC, the Indenture will permit ParentCo to satisfy its
obligations in this covenant with respect to the financial information relating to ParentCo by furnishing financial
information relating to such parent; provided that the same is accompanied by consolidating information that
explains in reasonable detail the differences between the information relating to such parent, on the one hand, and
the information relating to ParentCo and its Restricted Subsidiaries on a standalone basis, on the other hand. Such
parent shall not be considered a Guarantor by virtue of providing such guarantee, if applicable, which may be
released at any time. The obligations under this covenant may be satisfied by having the applicable entity file reports
containing the information contemplated hereby within the timeframes contemplated hereunder with the SEC.

At any time that any of ParentCo’s Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries, then the quarterly and annual
financial information required by this covenant will include a reasonably detailed presentation, on or in any of (i) the
face of the financial statements, (ii) the footnotes thereto or (iii) the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations” or other comparable section, of the financial condition and results of
operations of ParentCo and the Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of
operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries.

Delivery of reports, information and documents to the Trustee under the Indenture is for informational
purposes only and the information and the Trustee’s receipt of the foregoing shall not constitute constructive notice
of any information contained therein, or determinable from information contained therein including ParentCo’s
compliance with any of their covenants thereunder (as to which the Trustee is entitled to rely exclusively on an
Officer’s Certificate). The Trustee shall not be obligated to monitor or confirm, on a continuing basis or otherwise,
our compliance with the covenants or with respect to any reports or other documents filed with the SEC on EDGAR
or any website under the Indenture, or participate in any conference calls.

**Events of Default and Remedies**

The Indenture will provide that each of the following is an Event of Default:

(1) default in payment when due and payable, upon redemption, acceleration or otherwise, of
principal of, or premium, if any, on the Notes;

(2) default for 30 days or more in the payment when due of interest on or with respect to the
Notes;

(3) failure by an Issuer or any Guarantor for 60 days after receipt of written notice given by
the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 30% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes to
comply with any of their obligations, covenants or agreements (other than a default referred to in clauses
(1) and (2) above) contained in the Indenture, the Notes or the Collateral Documents; provided that in the
case of a failure to comply with the Indenture provisions described under the caption “— Reports and Other
Information,” such period of continuance of such default or breach shall be 270 days after written notice
described in this clause (3) has been given;

(4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there is issued or by
which there is secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by ParentCo or any Significant
Subsidiary or the payment of which is guaranteed by ParentCo or any Significant Subsidiary, other than
Indebtedness owed to ParentCo or any Significant Subsidiary, whether such Indebtedness or guarantee now
exists or is created after the issuance of the Notes, if both:

(a) such default either results from the failure to pay any principal of such
Indebtedness at its stated final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) or
relates to an obligation other than the obligation to pay principal of any such Indebtedness at its
stated final maturity and results in the holder or holders of such Indebtedness causing such
Indebtedness to become due prior to its stated maturity; and


-----

(b) the principal amount of such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of
any other such Indebtedness in default for failure to pay principal at stated final maturity (after
giving effect to any applicable grace periods), or the maturity of which has been so accelerated,
aggregate in excess of the greater of (I) $426.16 million and (II) 35% of Consolidated EBITDA
for the most recently ended Test Period as of such date, calculated on a Pro Forma Basis;

_provided that no Default or Event of Default will be deemed to occur with respect to any such Indebtedness_
that is paid or otherwise acquired or retired (or for which such failure to pay or acceleration is waived or
rescinded) within 20 Business Days after such failure to pay or such acceleration;

(5) failure by ParentCo or any Significant Subsidiary (or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries
that together (determined as of the most recent consolidated financial statements of ParentCo for a fiscal
quarter end provided as required by the covenant described under the caption “— Reports and Other
Information”) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) to pay final non-appealable judgments aggregating
in excess of the greater of (x) $412.16 million and (y) 35% of Consolidated EBITDA for the most recently
ended Test Period as of such date, calculated on a Pro Forma Basis (in each case, net of amounts covered
by insurance policies issued by reputable insurance companies), which final judgments remain unpaid,
undischarged and unstayed for a period of more than 90 days after such judgment becomes final, and in the
event such judgment is covered by insurance, an enforcement proceeding has been commenced by any
creditor upon such judgment or decree which is not promptly stayed;

(6) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to Holdings, any Intermediate
Parent, ParentCo, any Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary (or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that
together (determined as of the most recent consolidated financial statements of ParentCo for a fiscal quarter
end provided as required by the covenant described under the caption “—Reports and Other Information”)
would constitute a Significant Subsidiary);

(7) the Guarantee of any Significant Subsidiary shall for any reason cease to be in full force
and effect or be declared null and void or any Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary (or any group of
Restricted Subsidiaries that together (as of the most recent consolidated financial statement of ParentCo for
a fiscal quarter end) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary), as the case may be, denies in writing that it
has any further liability under its Guarantee or gives written notice to such effect, other than by reason of
the termination of the Indenture or the release of any such Guarantee in accordance with the Indenture;

(8) with respect to any Collateral, individually or in the aggregate, having a fair market value
in excess of the greater of (a) $235.52 million and (b) 20% of Consolidated EBITDA for the most recently
ended Test Period as of such date, calculated on a Pro Forma Basis, any of the Collateral Documents ceases
to be in full force and effect, or any of the Collateral Documents ceases to give the Holders of the Notes the
Liens purported to be created thereby with the priority contemplated thereby, or any of the Collateral
Documents is declared null and void or an Issuer or any Guarantor denies in writing that it has any further
liability under any Collateral Document or gives written notice to such effect (in each case other than in
accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement and the Collateral
Documents), except to the extent that any loss of perfection or priority results from the failure of the Notes
Collateral Agent to maintain possession of certificates actually delivered to it representing securities
pledged under the Collateral Documents, or otherwise results from an action (but not an omission)
constituting gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Trustee, the Notes Collateral Agent or
the First Lien Credit Facilities Collateral Agent; provided, that if a failure of the sort described in this
clause (8) is susceptible of cure (including with respect to any loss of Lien priority on material portions of
the Collateral), no Event of Default shall arise under this clause (8) with respect thereto until 60 days after
notice of such failure shall have been given to the Issuers by the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in
principal amount of the then outstanding Notes issued under the Indenture; or

(9) failure by the Issuers to consummate the Special mandatory Redemption as described
under “—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”


-----

However, a Default under clause (3), (4) or (5) of the immediately preceding paragraph will not constitute
an Event of Default until the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the then total
outstanding Notes notify the Issuers of the Default and, with respect to clauses (3) and (5), the Issuers do not cure
such Default within the time specified in clauses (3) and (5) of this paragraph after receipt of such notice. Any notice
of Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of Default, notice of acceleration or
take any other action (a “Noteholder Direction”) provided by any one or more Holders (each a “Directing Holder”)
must be accompanied by a written representation from each such Holder delivered to the Issuers and the Trustee that
such Holder is not (or, in the case such Holder is DTC or its nominee, that such Holder is being instructed solely by
beneficial owners that are not) Net Short (a “Position Representation”), which representation, in the case of a
Noteholder Direction relating to the delivery of a notice of Default shall be deemed a continuing representation until
the resulting Event of Default is cured or otherwise ceases to exist or the Notes are accelerated. In addition, each
Directing Holder is deemed, at the time of providing a Noteholder Direction, to covenant to provide the Issuers with
such other information as the Issuers may reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of
such Noteholder’s Position Representation within five Business Days of request therefor (a “Verification
_Covenant”). In any case in which the Holder is DTC or its nominee, any Position Representation or Verification_
Covenant required hereunder shall be provided by the beneficial owner of the Notes in lieu of DTC or its nominee
and DTC shall be entitled to conclusively rely on such Position Representation and Verification Covenant in
delivering its direction to the Trustee.

If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Issuers
determine in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was, at any relevant time, in
breach of its Position Representation and provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that the Issuers have
initiated litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction seeking a determination that such Directing Holder was, at
such time, in breach of its Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Default, Event of Default or
acceleration (or notice thereof) that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect
to such Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to such Default or Event of Default
shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending a final and non-appealable determination of a
court of competent jurisdiction on such matter. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to
acceleration of the Notes, the Issuers provide to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that a Directing Holder
failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant, the cure period with respect to such Default shall be automatically stayed
and the cure period with respect to any Default or Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder
Direction shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending satisfaction of such Verification
Covenant. Any breach of the Position Representation shall result in such Holder’s participation in such Noteholder
Direction being disregarded; and, if, without the participation of such Holder, the percentage of Notes held by the
remaining Holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been insufficient to validly provide such
Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio, with the effect that such Default or Event of
Default shall be deemed never to have occurred, acceleration voided and the Trustee shall be deemed not to have
received such Noteholder Direction or any notice of such Default or Event of Default.

Notwithstanding anything in the preceding two paragraphs to the contrary, any Noteholder Direction
delivered to the Trustee during the pendency of an Event of Default as the result of a bankruptcy or similar
proceeding shall not require compliance with the foregoing paragraphs.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any Noteholder Direction
delivered to it in accordance with the Indenture, shall have no duty to inquire as to or investigate the accuracy of any
Position Representation, enforce compliance with any Verification Covenant, verify any statements in any Officer’s
Certificate delivered to it or otherwise make calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to Derivative
Instruments, Net Shorts, Long Derivative Instruments, Short Derivative Instruments or otherwise. The Trustee shall
have no liability or responsibility to the Issuers, any Holder or any other Person in acting in good faith on a
Noteholder Direction or to determine whether or not any Holder has delivered a Position Representation or that such
Position Representation conforms with the Indenture or any other agreement.

If any Event of Default (other than of a type specified in clause (6) above) occurs and is continuing under
the Indenture, the Trustee by written notice to the Issuers or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal
amount of the then total outstanding Notes by written notice to the Issuers and the Trustee may declare the principal,
premium, if any, interest and any other monetary obligations on all the then outstanding Notes to be due and payable


-----

immediately; provided that a notice of Default may not be given with respect to any action taken, and reported
publicly or to Holders, more than two years prior to such notice of Default; provided, further, that such two-year
limitation shall not apply if the Trustee has commenced any remedial action in respect of any such Default. Any
time period to cure any actual or alleged Default or Event of Default may be extended or stayed by a court of
competent jurisdiction.

Upon the effectiveness of such declaration, such principal and interest will be due and payable
immediately. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an Event of Default arising under clause (6) of the first
paragraph of this section, all outstanding Notes will become due and payable without further action or notice. The
Indenture will provide that the Trustee may withhold from the Holders notice of any continuing Default, except a
Default relating to the payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest, if it determines that withholding notice is
in their interest. In addition, the Trustee shall have no obligation to accelerate the Notes.

The Indenture provides that the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding
Notes by written notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes waive any existing Default
and its consequences under the Indenture (except a continuing Default in the payment of interest on, premium, if
any, or the principal of any Note held by a non-consenting Holder) and rescind any acceleration with respect to the
Notes and its consequences, provided such rescission would not conflict with any judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction. In the event of any Event of Default specified in clause (4) above, such Event of Default and all
consequences thereof (excluding any resulting payment default, other than as a result of acceleration of the Notes)
shall be annulled, waived and rescinded, automatically and without any action by the Trustee or the Holders, if
within 20 days after such Event of Default arose:

(1) the Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been
discharged; or

(2) holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action (as the case
may be) giving rise to such Event of Default; or

(3) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured.

In case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent
will be under any obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of
any of the Holders of the Notes unless the Holders have offered, and if requested, provided to the Trustee and the
Notes Collateral Agent indemnity or security satisfactory to the Trustee and Notes Collateral Agent, as the case may
be, against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium, if
any, or interest when due, no Holder of a Note may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes
unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is
continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the total outstanding Notes have
requested the Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) Holders of the Notes have offered and, if requested, provide to the Trustee indemnity or
security reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt thereof
and the offer of security or indemnity; and

(5) Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the total outstanding Notes have
not given the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such request within such 60 -day period.


-----

Subject to certain restrictions, under the Indenture the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount
of the total outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding
for any remedy available to the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent or of exercising any trust or power conferred
on the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts
with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder of a
Note or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability (it being understood that the Trustee has no duty to
determine whether any such action is prejudicial to any Holder or beneficial owner of the Notes).

The Indenture will provide that the Issuers are required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement
regarding compliance with the Indenture, and the Issuers are required, within 30 Business Days, upon becoming
aware of any Default or Event of Default, to deliver to the Trustee a statement specifying such Default or Event of
Default, its status and what actions the Issuers are taking or proposes to take with respect thereto. The Trustee will
not be deemed to have knowledge of any Defaults or Events of Default unless written notice of an event, which is in
fact a Default or Event of Default, has been delivered to the Trustee at its office specified in the Indenture and such
notice references the Notes and the Indenture and states that it is a “Notice of Default.”

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Stockholders**

No past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner or stockholder of an
Issuer or any Guarantor or any of their direct or indirect parent companies (other than the Issuers and the
Guarantors) shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuers or the Guarantors under the Notes, the
Guarantees or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of such obligations or their
creation. Each Holder by accepting Notes waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of
the consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the federal
securities laws, and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance**

The obligations of the Issuers and the Guarantors under the Notes Documents will terminate (other than
certain obligations) and will be released upon payment in full of all of the Notes. The Issuers may, at their option
and at any time, elect to have all of their obligations discharged with respect to the Notes Documents and have each
Guarantor’s obligation discharged with respect to its Guarantee (“Legal Defeasance”) and cure all then existing
Events of Default except for:

(1) the rights of Holders of Notes to receive payments in respect of the principal of,
premium, if any, and interest on the Notes when such payments are due solely out of the trust created
pursuant to the Indenture;

(2) the Issuers’ obligations with respect to Notes concerning issuing temporary Notes,
registration of such Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an office or
agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust;

(3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee and the Notes Collateral
Agent, and the Issuers’ obligations in connection therewith; and

(4) the Legal Defeasance provisions of the Indenture.

In addition, the Issuers may, at their option and at any time, elect to have their obligations and those of each
Guarantor released with respect to certain covenants that are described in the Indenture (“Covenant Defeasance”)
and thereafter any omission to comply with such obligations shall not constitute a Default with respect to the Notes.
In the event Covenant Defeasance occurs, certain events (not including bankruptcy, receivership, rehabilitation and
insolvency events pertaining to the Issuers) described under the caption “Events of Default and Remedies” will no
longer constitute an Event of Default with respect to the Notes.


-----

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance with respect to the Notes:

(1) the Issuers must irrevocably deposit with the Trustee, in trust, for the benefit of the
Holders of the Notes, cash in U.S. dollars, Government Securities, or a combination thereof, in such
amounts as will be sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public
accountants, to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest due on the Notes on the stated maturity
date or on the redemption date, as the case may be, of such principal, premium, if any, or interest on such
Notes and the Issuers must specify whether such Notes are being defeased to maturity or to a particular
redemption date;

(2) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Issuers shall have delivered to the Trustee an
Opinion of Counsel confirming that, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions,

(a) the Issuers have received from, or there has been published by, the United States
Internal Revenue Service a ruling, or

(b) since the issuance of the Notes, there has been a change in the applicable U.S.
federal income tax law,

in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such Opinion of Counsel shall confirm that, subject to
customary assumptions and exclusions, the beneficial owners of the Notes will not recognize income, gain
or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as applicable, as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be
subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as
would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred;

(3) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Issuers shall have delivered to the Trustee an
Opinion of Counsel confirming that, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, the beneficial
owners of the Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result
of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to such tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and
at the same times as would have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred;

(4) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in a breach or violation
of, or constitute a default under the Senior Credit Facilities or any other material agreement or instrument
(other than the Indenture) to which, an Issuer or any Guarantor is a party or by which an Issuer or any
Guarantor is bound (other than that resulting from borrowing funds to be applied to make such deposit and
any similar and simultaneous deposit relating to other Indebtedness and, in each case, the granting of Liens
in connection therewith);

(5) the Issuers shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that the
deposit was not made by the Issuers with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding any
creditors of the Issuers or any Guarantor or others; and

(6) the Issuers shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of
Counsel (which Opinion of Counsel may be subject to customary assumptions and exclusions) each stating
that all conditions precedent provided for or relating to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant Defeasance,
as the case may be, have been complied with.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to all Notes, when either:

(1) all Notes theretofore authenticated and delivered, except lost, stolen or destroyed Notes
which have been replaced or paid and Notes for whose payment money has theretofore been deposited in
trust, have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or


-----

(2) (a) all Notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation have become due
and payable by reason of the making of a notice of redemption or otherwise, will become due and payable
within one year or may be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the

proposed amendment, supplement or waiver. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed
amendment or supplement. A consent to any amendment, supplement or waiver under the Indenture by any Holder
given in connection with a tender of such Holder’s Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender. After an
amendment, supplement or waiver under the Indenture becomes effective, the Issuers are required to give to the
Holders a notice (with a copy to the Trustee) briefly describing such amendment, supplement or waiver. However,
the failure to give such notice to all the Holders, or any defect in the notice will not impair or affect the validity of
any such amendment, supplement or waiver. Furthermore, by their acceptance of the Notes, each Holder of the
Notes is deemed to have consented to the terms of the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, the First/Second Lien
Intercreditor Agreement and the Collateral Documents and to have authorized and directed the Trustee and the
Collateral Agent, as applicable, to execute, deliver and perform each of the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, the

(“Fixed Amounts”) or (y) baskets, exceptions and thresholds that require compliance with a financial ratio or test
(including, without limitation, any Total Net Leverage Ratio, Senior Secured First Lien Net Leverage Ratio, Senior

grower basket measured as a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA (a “Grower Component”), if the Grower
Component of any such basket, threshold or other test exceeds the applicable Dollar Component at any time, the
Dollar Component shall be deemed to be increased to the highest amount of the Grower Component reached from
time to time (which amount shall not be subsequently reduced as a result of any decrease in the Grower
Component). For the avoidance of doubt, when calculating any leverage ratio in the Indenture, any cash proceeds of
Indebtedness incurred in connection with such calculation shall reduce the numerator thereof to the extent such
proceeds are not promptly applied.

**BOOK ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM**

The notes are being offered and sold to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers in

persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S (“Regulation S Notes”). Except as set forth below, the
notes will be issued in registered, global form in minimum denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000
in excess thereof. Notes will be issued at the closing of this offering only against payment in immediately available
funds.

Rule 144A Notes representing the notes initially will be represented by one or more global notes in
registered form without interest coupons (“Rule 144A Global Notes”). Regulation S Notes representing the notes
initially will be represented by one or more temporary global notes in registered form without interest coupons
(“Regulation S Temporary Global Notes”). Through and including the 40th day after the later of the commencement
of this offering and the closing of this offering (such period, the “Distribution Compliance Period”), beneficial
interests in the Regulation S Temporary Global Notes may be held only through the Euroclear System (“Euroclear”)
and Clearstream Banking, S.A. (“Clearstream”) (as indirect participants in DTC), unless transferred to a person that
takes delivery through a Rule 144A Global Note in accordance with the certification requirements described below
under “Exchanges Among Global Notes.” Within a reasonable time period after the expiration of the Distribution
Compliance Period, the Regulation S Temporary Global Notes will be exchanged for one or more permanent notes
in registered, global form without interest coupons (collectively, “Regulation S Permanent Global Notes”) upon
delivery to DTC of certification of compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the notes and pursuant to
Regulation S as provided in the indenture. Regulation S Temporary Global Notes and Regulation S Permanent
Global Notes are referred to herein as “Regulation S Global Notes” and Rule 144A Global Notes and Regulation S
Temporary Global Notes are collectively referred to herein as “Global Notes.”

Rule 144A Global Notes and Regulation S Temporary Global Notes will be deposited upon issuance with
Citibank, N.A., as registrar as custodian for DTC and registered in the name of DTC or its nominee, in each case for
credit to an account of a direct or indirect participant in DTC as described below. Beneficial interests in Rule 144A
Global Notes may not be exchanged for beneficial interests in Regulation S Global Notes at any time except in the
limited circumstances described below. See “— Exchanges Among Global Notes.” Except as set forth below,
Global Notes may be transferred only to another nominee of DTC or to a successor of DTC or its nominee, in whole
and not in part. Except in the limited circumstances described below, beneficial interests in Global Notes may not be
exchanged for notes in certificated form and owners of beneficial interests in Global Notes will not be entitled to
receive physical delivery of notes in certificated form. See “— Exchange of Global Notes for Certificated Notes.”

Rule 144A Global Notes and Regulation S Global Notes (including beneficial interests in the notes they
represent) will be subject to certain restrictions on transfer and will bear restrictive legends as described under
“Transfer Restrictions.” In addition, transfers of beneficial interests in Global Notes will be subject to the applicable
rules and procedures of DTC and its direct or indirect participants (including Euroclear and Clearstream), which
may change from time to time.

**Depository Procedures**

The following description of the operations and procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream is provided
solely as a matter of convenience. These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the respective
settlement systems and are subject to changes by them. None of the issuers, the Trustee, the Registrar or the Paying
Agent take any responsibility for these operations and procedures and urge investors to contact the system or their
participants directly to discuss these matters.

DTC has advised us that DTC is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of
New York, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal
Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the Uniform Commercial Code and a “clearing
agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC was created to hold
securities for its participating organizations (collectively, the “Participants”) and to facilitate the clearance and
settlement of transactions in those securities between the Participants through electronic book-entry changes in
accounts of its Participants. The Participants include securities brokers and dealers (including the initial purchasers),


-----

banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access to DTC’s system is also
available to other entities such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a
custodial relationship with a Participant, either directly or indirectly (collectively, the “Indirect Participants”).
Persons who are not Participants may beneficially own securities held by or on behalf of DTC only through the
Participants or the Indirect Participants. The ownership interests in, and transfers of ownership interests in, each
security held by or on behalf of DTC are recorded on the records of the Participants and Indirect Participants.

DTC has also advised us that, pursuant to procedures established by it:

(1) upon deposit of the Rule 144A Global Notes and the Regulation S Global Notes, DTC
will credit the accounts of Participants designated by the initial purchasers with portions of the principal
amount of the Rule 144A Global Notes and the Regulation S Global Notes; and

(2) ownership of these interests in Global Notes will be shown on, and the transfer of
ownership of these interests will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to the
Participants) or by the Participants and the Indirect Participants (with respect to other owners of beneficial
interests in Global Notes).

Investors in Rule 144A Global Notes who are Participants in DTC’s system may hold their interests therein
directly through DTC. Investors in Rule 144A Global Notes who are not Participants may hold their interests therein
indirectly through organizations (including Euroclear and Clearstream) that are Participants in DTC. All interests in
a Global Note may be subject to the procedures and requirements of DTC. Investors in Regulation S Global Notes
must initially hold their interests therein through Euroclear or Clearstream, if they are participants in those systems,
or indirectly through organizations that are participants. After the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period
(but not earlier), investors may also hold interests in Regulation S Global Notes through Participants in the DTC
system other than Euroclear and Clearstream. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in Regulation S Global
Notes on behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books
of their respective depositories, which are Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V., as operator of Euroclear, and Citibank, N.A.,
as operator of Clearstream, which in turn hold such interests in customers’ securities accounts in the depositaries’
names on the books of DTC. Interests in a Global Note held through Euroclear or Clearstream may be subject to the
procedures and requirements of those systems (as well as to the procedures and requirements of DTC). The laws of
some states require that certain persons take physical delivery in definitive form of securities that they own and the
ability to transfer beneficial interests in a Global Note to Persons that are subject to those requirements will be
limited to that extent. Because DTC can act only on behalf of Participants, which in turn act on behalf of Indirect
Participants, the ability of a person having beneficial interests in a Global Note to pledge those interests to Persons
that do not participate in the DTC system, or otherwise take actions in respect of those interests, may be affected by
the lack of a physical certificate evidencing those interests.

Except as described below, owners of an interest in Global Notes will not have notes registered in their
names, will not receive physical delivery of definitive notes in registered certificated form (“Certificated Notes”)
and will not be considered the registered owners or “Holders” thereof under the indenture for any purpose.

Payments in respect of the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on a Global Note registered in the
name of DTC or its nominee will be payable to DTC in its capacity as the registered Holder under the indenture.
Under the terms of the indenture, the issuers, the Registrar, the Paying Agent and the Trustee will treat the Persons
in whose names notes, including Global Notes, are registered as the owners of such notes for the purpose of
receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, none of the issuers, the Trustee, the Registrar, the
Paying Agent or any agent of the issuers or the Trustee, the Registrar, the Paying Agent has or will have any
responsibility or liability for:

(1) any aspect of DTC’s records or any Participant’s or Indirect Participant’s records relating
to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in Global Notes or for maintaining,
supervising or reviewing any of DTC’s records or any Participant’s or Indirect Participant’s records
relating to the beneficial ownership interests in Global Notes; or


-----

(2) any other matter relating to the actions and practices of DTC or any of its Participants or
Indirect Participants.

DTC has advised us that its current practice, upon receipt of any payment in respect of securities such as
the notes (including principal and interest), is to credit the accounts of the relevant Participants with the payment on
the payment date unless DTC has reason to believe it will not receive payment on that payment date. Each relevant
Participant is credited with an amount proportionate to its beneficial ownership of an interest in the principal amount
of the relevant security as shown on the records of DTC. Payments by the Participants and the Indirect Participants
to the beneficial owners of notes will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices and will be the
responsibility of the Participants or the Indirect Participants and will not be the responsibility of DTC, the Trustee,
the Registrar, the Paying Agent or the issuers. None of the issuers, the Registrar, the Paying Agent or the Trustee
will be liable for any delay by DTC or any of its Participants in identifying the beneficial owners of any notes, and
the issuers and the Trustee, the Registrar and the Paying Agent may conclusively rely on and will be protected in
relying on instructions from DTC or its nominee for all purposes.

Subject to the transfer restrictions set forth under “Transfer Restrictions,” transfers between Participants in
DTC will be effected in accordance with DTC’s procedures, and will be settled in same-day funds and transfers
between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in accordance with their respective rules and
operating procedures.

Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the notes described herein, cross-market
transfers between the Participants, on the one hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream participants, on the other hand,
will be effected through DTC in accordance with DTC’s rules on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case
may be, by their respective depositaries; however, such cross-market transactions will require delivery of
instructions to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by the counterparty in such system in accordance with
the rules and procedures and within the established deadlines (Brussels time) of such system. Euroclear or
Clearstream, as the case may be, will, if the transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to its
respective depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving interests in the
relevant Global Note from DTC, and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for sameday funds settlement applicable to DTC. Euroclear participants and Clearstream participants may not deliver
instructions directly to the depositories for Euroclear or Clearstream.

DTC has advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a Holder of notes only at the
direction of one or more Participants to whose account DTC has credited the interests in the Global Notes and only
in respect of the portion of the aggregate principal amount of the notes as to which that Participant or those
Participants has or have given the relevant direction. However, if there is an Event of Default under the notes, DTC
reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for legended notes in certificated form, and to distribute those notes
to its Participants. Although DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to
facilitate transfers of interests in Global Notes among Participants, they are under no obligation to perform those
procedures, and may discontinue or change those procedures at any time.

None of the issuers, the Registrar, the Paying Agent or the Trustee nor any of their respective agents will
have any responsibility for the performance by DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or their respective Participants or
Indirect Participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Exchange of Global Notes for Certificated Notes**

A Global Note is exchangeable for a Certificated Note if:

    - DTC (a) notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for the applicable Global
Notes or (b) has ceased to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act and, in each case, a
successor depositary is not appointed; or

    - there has occurred and is continuing an Event of Default with respect to the notes and such beneficial
owner requests that its notes be issued in physical certificated form.


-----

In addition, beneficial interests in a Global Note may be exchanged for Certificated Notes upon prior
written notice given to the Trustee, the Registrar and the Paying Agent by or on behalf of DTC in accordance with
the indenture. In all cases, Certificated Notes delivered in exchange for any Global Note or beneficial interests in a
Global Note will be registered in the names, and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of
the depositary (in accordance with its customary procedures) and will bear the applicable restrictive legend referred
to in “Transfer Restrictions,” unless that legend is not required by applicable law.

**Exchange of Certificated Notes for Global Notes**

If Certificated Notes are issued in the future, they will not be exchangeable for beneficial interests in any
Global Note unless the transferor first delivers to the issuers, the Registrar, the Paying Agent and the Trustee a
written certificate (in the form provided in the indenture) to the effect that the transfer will comply with the
appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to the notes being transferred. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

**Exchanges Among Global Notes**

Prior to the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period, beneficial interests in a Regulation S Global
Note may be exchanged for beneficial interests in a Rule 144A Global Note only if:

    - the exchange occurs in connection with a transfer of the notes pursuant to Rule 144A; and

    - the transferor first delivers to the issuers, the Registrar, the Paying Agent and the Trustee a written
certificate (in the form provided in the indenture) to the effect that the notes are being transferred:

    - to a Person who (i) the transferor reasonably believes to be a qualified institutional buyer within the
meaning of Rule 144A and (ii) is purchasing for its own account or the account of a qualified
institutional buyer in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A; and

    - in accordance with all applicable securities laws of the states of the US and other jurisdictions.

Beneficial interests in a Rule 144A Global Note may be transferred to a Person who takes delivery in the
form of an interest in the Regulation S Global Note, whether before or after the expiration of the Distribution
Compliance Period, only if the transferor first delivers to the issuers, the Registrar, the Paying Agent and the Trustee
a written certificate (in the form provided in the indenture) to the effect that the transfer is being made in accordance
with Rule 903 or Rule 904 of Regulation S or Rule 144.

Transfers involving exchanges of beneficial interests between a Regulation S Global Note and a Rule 144A
Global Note will be effected in DTC by means of an instruction originated by the DTC Participant through the DTC
Deposit/Withdraw at Custodian system. Accordingly, in connection with any such transfer, appropriate adjustments
will be made to reflect the changes in the principal amounts of the Regulation S Global Note and the Rule 144A
Global Note, as applicable. Any beneficial interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a Person who
takes delivery in the form of an interest in the other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be an interest in the
original Global Note and will become an interest in the other Global Note and, accordingly, will thereafter be
subject to all transfer restrictions and other procedures applicable to beneficial interest in the other Global Note.

**Same Day Settlement and Payment**

We will make payments in respect of notes represented by Global Notes, including payments of principal,
premium, if any, and interest by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by DTC or its
nominee. We will make all payments of principal of and premium, if any, and interest on Certificated Notes by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the Holders of the Certificated Notes or, if no
account is specified, by mailing a check to each Holder’s registered address. Notes represented by Global Notes are
expected to be eligible to trade in DTC’s Same-Day Funds Settlement System, and any permitted secondary market
trading activity in notes represented by Global Notes will, therefore, be required by DTC to be settled in
immediately available funds. Because of time zone differences, the securities account of a Euroclear or Clearstream


-----

participant purchasing an interest in a Global Note from a Participant will be credited, and any such crediting will be
reported to the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream participant, during the securities settlement processing day (which
must be a business day for Euroclear and Clearstream) immediately following the settlement date of DTC. DTC has
advised us that cash received in Euroclear or Clearstream as a result of sales of interests in a Global Note by or
through a Euroclear or Clearstream participant to a Participant will be received with value on the settlement date of
DTC but will be available in the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream cash account only as of the business day for
Euroclear or Clearstream following DTC’s settlement date.

**CERTAIN U. S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations that may be relevant to the
purchase, ownership and disposition of the notes issued pursuant to this offering as of the date hereof to U.S.
Holders and Non-U.S. Holders (each as defined below). This summary deals only with notes that are held as “capital
assets” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), by a
holder that acquires the notes at their initial issue price (i.e., the first price at which a substantial amount of the notes
is sold to investors for cash, excluding sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the
capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers).

This summary is based upon provisions of the Code, U.S. Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder,
published administrative guidance of the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”), judicial decisions and other
applicable authorities, all as in effect as of the date hereof. All of these authorities may be changed or subject to
differing interpretations, possibly with retroactive effect, so as to result in U.S. federal income tax consequences
different from those summarized below. We have not sought, and do not expect to seek, any ruling from the IRS
with respect to the statements made or the conclusions reached in this summary, and there can be no assurance that
the IRS or a court will agree with those statements or conclusions or that a court would not sustain any challenge by
the IRS in the event of litigation. Moreover, this summary does not address any U.S. federal tax considerations other
than income tax considerations (including estate or gift tax considerations), state, local, or non-U.S. tax
considerations or considerations under any applicable tax treaty. In addition, this summary is general in nature and
does not purport to be a complete description of the U.S. federal income tax considerations that may be relevant to
holders in light of their personal circumstances or status or to holders subject to special treatment under U.S. federal
income tax laws (including, without limitation, former citizens or residents of the United States; regulated
investment companies; real estate investment trusts; insurance companies; entities treated as partnerships or other
passthrough entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or investors therein); banks or other financial institutions;
tax-exempt entities; persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income with
respect to the notes being taken into account in an “applicable financial statement,” as defined in Section 451 of the
Code; corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax; U.S. Holders whose functional
currency is not the U.S. dollar; S corporations; dealers in securities or currencies; traders in securities or currencies
that elect to use the mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities holdings; persons holding notes as part
of a “straddle,” conversion transaction, integrated transaction, constructive sale transaction, hedge or hedging
transaction; persons purchasing or selling notes as part of a wash sale for tax purposes; or entities subject to any of
the anti-inversion rules).

If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds notes, the tax
treatment of a partner in such entity or arrangement generally will depend upon the status of the partner and the
activities of the partner and the partnership. Entities or arrangements treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income
tax purposes that are considering an investment in notes and partners therein should consult their own tax advisors
as to the particular U.S. federal income tax consequences applicable to them.

**The following discussion is for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for careful tax**
**planning and advice. Prospective investors that are considering the purchase of notes should consult their**
**own tax advisors concerning the particular U.S. federal income tax consequences to them of the purchase,**
**ownership and disposition of notes, as well as the consequences to them arising under any other U.S. federal**
**tax laws or the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction or under any applicable treaty.**

**Certain Contingent Payments**

In certain circumstances (see, e.g., “Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption,” “Description of the
Notes—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change of Control”), we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess
of the stated interest or principal on the notes. The requirement to make any such payments may implicate the
provisions of the Treasury regulations governing contingent payment debt instruments (“CPDIs”). However,
according to the applicable Treasury regulations, certain contingencies (e.g., contingencies that are, in the aggregate
and as of the date of issuance, “remote” or “incidental”) will not cause a debt instrument to be treated as a CPDI.
Although the matter is not free from doubt, we intend to take the position that, as of the date of issuance, the
foregoing contingencies should not cause the notes to be treated as CPDIs.


-----

Our determination that the notes are not CPDIs is binding on a holder, unless such holder expressly
discloses its contrary position in the manner required by applicable Treasury regulations. Our determination is not,
however, binding on the IRS. If the IRS were to successfully challenge our determination, a holder subject to U.S.
federal income taxation may be required to accrue interest income on the notes at a higher rate than the stated rate of
interest on the notes, and to treat any gain recognized on the taxable disposition of a note as ordinary income rather
than as a capital gain. The remainder of this discussion assumes that the notes will not be treated as CPDIs.

**Effect of the Escrow Sub Merger and Addition of a Co-Obligor**

Upon the consummation of the Acquisition, the Escrow Issuer will merge with and into TIH, with TIH
surviving the Escrow Sub Merger and assuming the obligations of the Escrow Issuer under the notes. In addition,
from and after the consummation of the Acquisition and following the satisfaction of the Escrow Conditions (if
applicable), McGriff Insurance will become a co-obligor on the notes and the notes will become fully and
unconditionally guaranteed on a senior secured basis by Holdings, ParentCo, ParentCo’s existing wholly-owned
domestic restricted subsidiaries that guarantee the issuers’ obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities (other than
Panther Co-Issuer, which will be a guarantor under the Senior Credit Facilities and a co-issuer of the notes) and any
future wholly-owned domestic subsidiary of Holdings of which ParentCo is a subsidiary that guarantees the
obligations of the issuers under the Senior Credit Facilities.

For U.S. federal income tax purposes, a modification of a debt instrument may under certain circumstances
be treated as an exchange of the debt instrument for a new debt instrument. In general, the modification is
considered to be a taxable exchange when, taking into account all modifications to the debt instrument collectively,
the legal rights or obligations that are altered, and the degree to which they are altered, are economically significant
(a “significant modification”).

Although the matter is not free from doubt, we intend to take the position, and the remainder of this
disclosure assumes, that under the applicable Treasury regulations, the change in obligor, the addition of an
additional co-obligor and the change in security and credit enhancement, should not constitute a significant
modification of the notes. Accordingly, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a holder of notes should not recognize
income, gain or loss with respect to the notes as a result of the Escrow Sub Merger, and should have the same
adjusted basis and holding period in the notes as before the Escrow Sub Merger. We cannot provide assurance,
however, that the IRS will not reach a different conclusion. Prospective holders of notes should consult their own
tax advisors regarding the potential tax consequences of the Escrow Sub Merger.

**U.S. Holders**

For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of a note that, for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, is:

    - an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;

    - a corporation created or organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District
of Columbia;

    - an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source; or

    - a trust that (i) is subject to the primary supervision of a U.S. court and the control of one or more
“United States persons” within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code (a “U.S. Person”) or
(ii) has a valid election in effect to be treated as a U.S. Person for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

**_Stated Interest_**

Stated interest on a note generally will be taxable to a U.S. Holder as ordinary income at the time such
interest is accrued or received in accordance with the U.S. Holder’s regular method of tax accounting for U.S.
federal income tax purposes.


-----

**_Sale or Other Taxable Disposition of a Note_**

A U.S. Holder generally will recognize taxable gain or loss on the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement
or other taxable disposition of a note in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount received for
the note in cash or other property valued at fair market value (less amounts attributable to any accrued but unpaid
interest, which will be taxable as interest to the extent not previously included in income) and the U.S. holder’s
adjusted tax basis in the note. A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in a note generally will equal the amount such U.S.
Holder paid for the note. Any gain or loss will be capital gain or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the
U.S. Holder has held the note for more than one year at the time of the sale or other taxable disposition. Otherwise,
such gain or loss will be short-term capital gain or loss. Long-term capital gains recognized by certain non-corporate
U.S. Holders, including individuals, generally will be taxable at a reduced rate. The deductibility of capital losses is
subject to limitations.

**_Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_**

Information reporting generally will apply to payments of interest on, and the proceeds from a sale or other
taxable disposition (including a redemption or retirement) of, notes held by a U.S. Holder. In addition, backup
withholding (currently at a rate of 24%) generally will apply to such payments unless such U.S. Holder provides the
applicable withholding agent such U.S. Holder’s taxpayer identification number, certified under penalties of perjury,
as well as certain other information or otherwise establishes an exemption from backup withholding.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules
may be allowed as a refund or a credit against a U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, provided the
required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

**Tax Considerations Applicable to Non-U.S. Holders**

For purposes of this discussion, a “Non-U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of a note that, for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, is an individual, corporation, trust or estate that is not a U.S. Holder.

**_Payments of Interest_**

Subject to the discussions of backup withholding and FATCA below, payments of interest on a note to a
Non-U.S. Holder generally will be exempt from U.S. federal income and withholding tax, provided that:

    - such Non-U.S. Holder does not actually or constructively own stock (or capital or profits interests, if
applicable) possessing 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of any issuer’s
voting stock (or capital or profits interests, if applicable);

    - such Non-U.S. Holder is not a “controlled foreign corporation” that is actually or constructively related
to us through stock ownership under the applicable provisions of the Code;

    - such Non-U.S. Holder is not a bank whose receipt of interest on the notes is described in Section
881(c)(3)(A) of the Code;

    - such interest is not effectively connected with such Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade or business
in the United States; and

    - the applicable withholding agent has received documentation required by applicable Treasury
regulations from the Non-U.S. Holder or an applicable intermediary through which the Non-U.S.
Holder holds its notes, as applicable, properly certifying, under penalty of perjury, that such non-U.S.
Holder is not a U.S. Person, which is generally delivered using a duly completed and executed IRS
Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, as applicable.


-----

If a Non-U.S. Holder cannot satisfy the requirements described above, payments of interest on a note to
such non-U.S. holder generally will be subject to a 30% U.S. federal withholding tax, unless such non-U.S. holder
provides the applicable withholding agent with a properly executed IRS Form W-8BEN or Form W-8BEN-E (or
other applicable form), as applicable, claiming an exemption from or reduction in U.S. federal withholding tax under
an applicable income tax treaty or IRS Form W-8ECI (or other applicable form) providing that interest paid on the
note is not subject to U.S. federal withholding tax because it is effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Holder’s
conduct of a trade or business in the United States.

If interest on a note is effectively connected with a Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade or business in the
United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, the Non-U.S. Holder maintains a permanent
establishment in the United States to which such interest is attributable), the Non-U.S. Holder will generally be
exempt from the 30% withholding tax, provided the certification requirements discussed above are satisfied, but will
be subject to U.S. federal income tax on that interest on a net basis in generally the same manner as if such Non-U.S.
Holder were a U.S. Holder. In addition, if the Non-U.S. Holder is a corporation, it may be subject to a U.S. branch
profits tax at a rate of 30% (or lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty) of its effectively connected earnings
and profits, subject to certain adjustments.

The certifications described above must be provided to the applicable withholding agent prior to the
payment of interest and must be updated periodically. Non-U.S. Holders that do not timely provide the applicable
withholding agent with the required certification, but that qualify for a reduced rate under an applicable income tax
treaty, may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld by timely filing an appropriate claim for refund with the
IRS. Non-U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding their entitlement to benefits under any
applicable income tax treaty.

**_Sale or Other Taxable Disposition of a Note_**

Subject to the discussions of backup withholding and FATCA below, a Non-U.S. Holder generally will not
be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax with respect to any gain recognized on the sale, exchange,
redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a note (other than any amount representing accrued but unpaid
interest on the note, which is subject to the rules discussed above under “—Payments of Interest”) unless:

    - the gain is effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade or business in the
United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, the Non-U.S. Holder maintains a
permanent establishment in the United States to which such gain is attributable); or

    - the Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the
taxable year of the disposition and certain other conditions are met.

If the first exception applies, unless an applicable income tax treaty provides otherwise, the Non-U.S.
Holder will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the taxable gain recognized on the disposition in
generally the same manner as if it were a U.S. Holder. In addition, if such Non-U.S. Holder is a corporation, it may
be subject to a U.S. branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or lower applicable income tax treaty rate) of its effectively
connected earnings and profits, subject to certain adjustments. If the second exception applies, the non-U.S. holder
will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate specified by an applicable
income tax treaty) on such gain, which gain may be offset by certain U.S. source capital losses, provided that the
Non-U.S. Holder has timely filed U.S. federal income tax returns with respect to such losses.


-----

**_Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_**

Interest paid to a Non-U.S. Holder on a note and the amount of tax, if any, withheld with respect to those
payments generally will be reported to the IRS. Copies of the information returns reporting such interest payments
and any withholding may also be made available to the tax authorities in the country in which a Non-U.S. Holder
resides under the provisions of an applicable income tax treaty. In general, a non-U.S. holder will not be subject to
backup withholding with respect to payments of interest on the notes, provided that the Non-U.S. Holder provides
the certification described above under “—Payments of Interest.”

Information reporting and, depending on the circumstances, backup withholding will apply to the proceeds
from a sale or other taxable disposition (including redemption or retirement) of a note within the United States or
conducted through certain U.S.-related financial intermediaries, unless a Non-U.S. Holder certifies to the applicable
withholding agent under penalties of perjury that it is not a U.S. Person or otherwise establishes an exemption.
Proceeds of a disposition of a note paid outside the United States and conducted through a non-U.S. office of a nonU.S. broker generally will not be subject to backup withholding or information reporting.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules
will be allowed as a refund or a credit against a Non-U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided
the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

**FATCA**

Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code, commonly referred to as the Foreign Account Tax Compliance
Act (“FATCA”) impose withholding tax at a rate of 30% on payments of interest in respect of the notes and, subject
to the discussion below, on the gross proceeds from the sale or disposition of notes, paid to a foreign financial
institution (whether such institution is the beneficial owner or an intermediary), unless the foreign financial
institution enters into an agreement with the U.S. Department of the Treasury to, among other things, undertake to
identify accounts held by certain U.S. persons or U.S.-owned entities, annually report certain information about such
accounts, and withhold 30% on payments to account holders whose actions prevent it from complying with these
and other reporting requirements, or unless the foreign financial institution is otherwise exempt from those
requirements. In addition, FATCA imposes a 30% withholding tax on the same types of payments to a non-financial
foreign entity (whether such entity is the beneficial owner or an intermediary) unless the entity certifies that it does
not have any substantial U.S. owners, the entity furnishes identifying information regarding each substantial U.S.
owner or an exemption applies.

The U.S. Department of the Treasury recently released proposed regulations which, if finalized in their
present form, would eliminate the U.S. federal withholding tax of 30% applicable to the gross proceeds of a sale or
disposition of a debt instrument. In the preamble to the proposed regulations, the U.S. Department of the Treasury
provided that taxpayers may generally rely on the proposed regulations until final regulations are issued.

Prospective holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the possible implications of FATCA
with respect to an investment in notes.

investment and (b) you are not acquiring the notes with a view towards any distribution thereof in a
transaction that would violate the Securities Act or the securities laws of any state of the U.S. or any other
applicable jurisdiction; provided that the disposition of your property and the property of any accounts for
which you are acting as fiduciary will remain at all times within your control.

**CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a summary of certain considerations associated with the purchase and holding of the notes
by (a) employee benefit plans that are subject to Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended (“ERISA”), (b) plans, individual retirement accounts and other arrangements that are subject to Section
4975 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) or provisions under any other federal, state,
local, non-U.S. or other laws or regulations that are similar to such provisions of ERISA or the Code (collectively,
“Similar Laws”), and (c) entities whose underlying assets are considered to include “plan assets,” within the
meaning of 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101, as modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA (the “Plan Asset Regulations”) of
any such plan, account or arrangement described in clause (a) or (b) (each of the foregoing described in clauses (a)
(b), and (c) referred to as a “Plan”).

**General Fiduciary Matters**

ERISA and the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of a Plan subject to Title I of
ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (an “ERISA Plan”) and prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an
ERISA Plan and its fiduciaries or other interested parties. Under ERISA and the Code, any person (i) who exercises
any discretionary authority or control over (a) the administration of such an ERISA Plan or (b) the management or
disposition of the assets of such an ERISA Plan, or (ii) who renders investment advice for a fee or other
compensation to such an ERISA Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan.

Non-U.S. plans, U.S. governmental plans and certain U.S. church plans, while not subject to the fiduciary
responsibility provisions of ERISA or the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code
(as discussed below), may nevertheless be subject to Similar Laws. Fiduciaries of any such Plans should consult
with their counsel before purchasing the notes to determine the suitability of the notes for such Plan and the need
for, and the availability, if necessary, of any exemptive relief under any such laws or regulations.

In considering whether to invest a portion of the assets of any Plan in the notes, a fiduciary should
determine whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the
applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law relating to a fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including,
without limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of
ERISA, the Code and any other applicable Similar Laws. A plan fiduciary should consider the Plan’s particular
circumstances and all of the facts and circumstances of the purchase and holding of the notes, including, without
limitation, the matters discussed above under “Risk Factors” in determining whether the purchase and holding of the
notes satisfies these requirements.

Each Plan should consider the fact that none of the Transaction Parties is acting, or will act, as a fiduciary
to any Plan with respect to the decision to purchase or hold the notes (other than, in the case of an acquisition in
which an affiliate of a Transaction Party acts as a fiduciary to the Plan, where a statutory or administrative
exemption applies (all of the applicable conditions of which are satisfied) or the transaction is not otherwise
prohibited). The Transaction Parties are not undertaking to provide any advice or recommendation, including,
without limitation, in a fiduciary capacity, with respect to the decision to purchase or hold the notes. All
communications, correspondence and materials from the Transaction Parties with respect to the notes are intended to
be general in nature and are not directed at any specific purchaser of the notes, and do not constitute advice
regarding the advisability of investment in the notes for any specific purchaser. The decision to purchase and hold
the notes must be made solely by each prospective Plan purchaser on an arm’s length basis.

This offer is not a representation by the issuers or any of its affiliates that the purchase and holding of the
notes meets all legal requirements applicable to investments by Plans, or that such an investment is appropriate for
any particular Plan.

**Prohibited Transaction Issues**

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit ERISA Plans from engaging in specified
transactions involving plan assets with persons or entities who are “parties in interest,” within the meaning of


-----

ERISA, or “disqualified persons,” within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless an exemption is available.
A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to
excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of the ERISA
Plan that engages in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under
ERISA and/or the Code. The purchase and/or holding of notes by an ERISA Plan with respect to which any
Transaction Party is considered a party in interest or a disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or
indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment
is acquired and held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption.
Included among these exemptions are Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code for certain
transactions between a Plan and non-fiduciary service providers to the Plan.

In addition, the U.S. Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions, or “PTCEs,”
that may apply to the purchase and holding of the notes. These class exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE
84-14 respecting transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1
respecting insurance company pooled separate accounts, PTCE 91-38 respecting bank collective investment funds,
PTCE 95-60 respecting life insurance company general accounts and PTCE 96-23 respecting transactions
determined by in-house asset managers. In addition, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the
Code provide relief from the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code for certain
transactions, provided that neither the issuer of the securities nor any of its affiliates (directly or indirectly) have or
exercise any discretionary authority or control or render any investment advice with respect to the assets of any
ERISA Plan involved in the transaction and provided further that the ERISA Plan pays no more than adequate
consideration in connection with the transaction. Each of the above-noted exemptions contains conditions and
limitations on its application. Fiduciaries of ERISA Plans considering purchasing and/or holding the notes in
reliance of these or any other exemption should carefully review the exemption to assure it is applicable. There can
be no assurance that all of the conditions of any such exemptions will be satisfied.

Governmental plans, non-U.S. plans and certain church plans, while not subject to the prohibited
transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, may nevertheless be subject to Similar Laws which
may affect their investment in the notes. Any fiduciary of a governmental, non-U.S. or such a church plan
considering an investment in the notes should consult with its counsel before purchasing notes to consider the
applicable fiduciary standards and to determine the need for, and, if necessary, the availability of, any exemptive
relief under any applicable Similar Laws.

Because of the foregoing, the notes should not be purchased or held by any person investing “plan assets”
of any Plan unless such purchase and holding will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction under ERISA
and the Code or a similar violation of any applicable Similar Laws.

**Representation**

Accordingly, by acceptance of a note, each purchaser and subsequent transferee of a note (or any interest
therein) will be deemed to have represented and warranted that (A) either (i) no portion of the assets used by such
purchaser or transferee to purchase or hold the notes (or any interest therein) constitutes assets of any Plan or (ii) the
purchase and holding of the notes by such purchaser or transferee will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited
transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a similar violation under any applicable
Similar Laws, and none of the Transaction Parties is a fiduciary or providing any investment or other advice, to such
purchaser or transferee with respect to such purchase or holding of the notes (or interest therein), unless, solely with
respect to an acquisition in which an affiliate of a Transaction Party acts as a fiduciary to the purchaser, a statutory
or administrative exemption applies (all of the applicable conditions of which are satisfied) or the transaction is not
otherwise prohibited, and none of them shall at any time be relied upon as a fiduciary with respect to any decision to
acquire, continue to hold or transfer the notes and (B) it will not sell or otherwise transfer such notes or any interest
therein otherwise than to a purchaser or transferee that is deemed to make these same representations, warranties and
agreements with respect to its purchase and holding of such note or any interest therein.

The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all inclusive, nor should it be
construed as legal advice. Due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons
involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries, or other persons


-----

considering purchasing the notes on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their counsel regarding
the potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws to such investment and
whether an exemption would be applicable to the purchase and holding of the notes. Purchasers of the notes have the
exclusive responsibility for ensuring that their purchase and holding of the notes complies with the fiduciary
responsibility rules of ERISA and does not violate the prohibited transaction rules of ERISA, the Code or applicable
Similar Laws. The sale of a note to a Plan is in no respect a representation by any Transaction Party or any of their
respective affiliates or representatives that such an investment meets all relevant legal requirements with respect to
investments by any such Plan or that such investment is appropriate for any such Plan.

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC is acting as representative of each of the initial purchasers named below. Subject
to the terms and conditions set forth in a purchase agreement among us and the initial purchasers, we have agreed to
sell to the initial purchasers, and each of the initial purchasers has agreed, severally and not jointly, to purchase from
us, the principal amount of notes set forth opposite its name below.

**Principal Amount**

**Initial Purchasers** **of the Notes**

Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC ........................................................................................................ $
BofA Securities, Inc. ...................................................................................................................

R. Seelaus & Co., LLC................................................................................................................
**Total ......................................................................................................................................** **$**

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the purchase agreement, the initial purchasers have agreed,
severally and not jointly, to purchase all of the notes sold under the purchase agreement if any of these notes are
purchased. If an initial purchaser defaults, the purchase agreement provides that the purchase commitments of the
non-defaulting initial purchasers may be increased or the purchase agreement may be terminated.

We have agreed to indemnify the initial purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the
Securities Act, or to contribute to payments the initial purchasers may be required to make in respect of those liabilities.

**Commissions and Discounts**

The representative has advised us that the initial purchasers propose initially to offer the notes at the offering
price set forth on the cover page of this offering memorandum. After the initial offering, the offering price or any other
term of the offering may be changed. The initial purchasers may offer and sell the notes outside of the United States.
If the initial purchasers offer and sell the notes outside of the United States, such offer and sales may be made by
certain of their affiliates.


-----

**Delivery of the Notes**

It is expected that delivery of the notes will be made against payment therefor on or about the date specified
on the cover of this offering memorandum, which is the    business day following the date of pricing of the notes
(such settlement cycle being referred to as “T+   ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Exchange Act, trades in the
secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly
agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the notes prior to the date that is two business days
preceding the settlement date will be required, by virtue of the fact that the notes will not initially settle in T+2, to
specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent failed settlement. Purchasers of the
notes who wish to trade the notes prior to their date of delivery hereunder should consult their own advisors.

**Notes Are Not Being Registered**

The notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws. The
initial purchasers propose to offer the notes for resale in transactions not requiring registration under the Securities
Act or applicable state securities laws, including sales pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act and Regulation
S under the Securities Act. The initial purchasers will not offer or sell the notes except to persons they reasonably
believe to be QIBs or pursuant to offers and sales to non-U.S. persons that occur outside of the United States within
the meaning of Regulation S under the Securities Act. In addition, until 40 days following the later of the
commencement or closing of this offering, an offer or sale of notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or
not participating in the offering) may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act unless the dealer makes
the offer or sale in compliance with Rule 144A or another exemption from registration under the Securities Act. Each
purchaser of the notes will be deemed to have made acknowledgments, representations and agreements as described
under “Transfer Restrictions.”

**New Issue of Notes**

The notes are a new issue of securities with no established trading market. We do not intend to apply for
listing of the notes on any national securities exchange or for inclusion of the notes on any automated dealer quotation
system. We have been advised by certain of the initial purchasers that they presently intend to make a market in the
notes after completion of the offering. However, they are under no obligation to do so and may discontinue any marketmaking activities at any time without any notice. We cannot assure the liquidity of the trading market for the notes. If
an active trading market for the notes does not develop, the market price and liquidity of the notes may be adversely
affected. If the notes are traded, they may trade at a discount from their initial offering price, depending on prevailing
interest rates, the market for similar securities, our operating performance and financial condition, general economic
conditions and other factors.

**No Sales of Similar Securities**

We have agreed that we will not, for a period of 45 days after the date of this offering memorandum, without
first obtaining the prior written consent of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, directly or indirectly, issue, sell, offer to
contract or grant any option to sell, pledge, transfer or otherwise dispose of, any debt securities or securities
exchangeable for or convertible into debt securities, except for the notes sold to the initial purchasers pursuant to the
purchase agreement.

**Short Positions**

In connection with the offering, the initial purchasers may purchase and sell the notes in the open market.
These transactions may include short sales and purchases on the open market to cover positions created by short sales.
Short sales involve the sale by the initial purchasers of a greater principal amount of notes than they are required to
purchase in the offering. The initial purchasers must close out any short position by purchasing notes in the open
market. A short position is more likely to be created if the initial purchasers are concerned that there may be downward
pressure on the price of the notes in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase
in the offering.


-----

Similar to other purchase transactions, the initial purchasers’ purchases to cover the syndicate short sales may
have the effect of raising or maintaining the market price of the notes or preventing or retarding a decline in the market
price of the notes. As a result, the price of the notes may be higher than the price that might otherwise exist in the open
market.

Neither we nor any of the initial purchasers make any representation or prediction as to the direction or
magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the notes. In addition, neither
we nor any of the initial purchasers make any representation that the representative will engage in these transactions
or that these transactions, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice.

**PRIIPs Regulation / Prohibition of Sales to European Economic Area Retail Investors**

The notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold
or otherwise made available to any retail investor in a member state of the European Economic Area (“EEA”). For
these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of
Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU)
2016/97 (as amended, the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a
“professional client” as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a “qualified investor” as defined
in Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended, the “Prospectus Regulation”). Consequently, no key information
document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling
the notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering
or selling the notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the
PRIIPs Regulation. This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of notes in any member
state of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to
publish a prospectus for offers of notes. This offering memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the
Prospectus Regulation.

The above selling restriction is in addition to any other selling restrictions set out below.

**Notice to Prospective Investors in the United Kingdom**

The notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold
or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom (the “U.K.”). For these purposes, a “retail
investor” means a person who is one (or more) of the following (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2
of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act
2018 (the “EUWA”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the Financial Services and Markets Act
2000 (as amended, the “FSMA”) and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement the Insurance
Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article
2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (iii) not a qualified
investor as defined in Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA
(the “U.K. Prospectus Regulation”). Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No
1286/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “U.K. PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or
selling the notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the U.K. has been prepared and therefore
offering or selling the notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the U.K. may be unlawful
under the U.K. PRIIPs Regulation. This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the
notes in the U.K. will be made pursuant to an exemption under section 86 of the FSMA from the requirement to
publish a prospectus for offers of notes. This offering memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the U.K.
Prospectus Regulation.

This offering memorandum has not been approved by an authorised person in the U.K. This offering
memorandum is for distribution only to persons who: (i) have professional experience in matters relating to
investments falling within Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order
2005, as amended (the “Financial Promotion Order”), (ii) are persons falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) (high net
worth companies, unincorporated associations etc.) of the Financial Promotion Order, (iii) are outside the United
Kingdom, or (iv) are persons to whom an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the
meaning of section 21 of the FSMA) in connection with the issue or sale of any securities may otherwise lawfully be

offering memorandum is directed only at relevant persons and must not be acted on or relied on by persons who are
not relevant persons. Any investment or investment activity to which this offering memorandum relates is available
only to relevant persons and will be engaged in only with relevant persons.

**Notice to Prospective Investors in Switzerland**

The offering of the notes in Switzerland is exempt from requirement to prepare and publish a prospectus
under the Swiss Financial Services Act (“FinSA”) because such offering is made to professional clients within the
meaning of the FinSA only and the notes will not be admitted to trading on any trading venue (exchange or multilateral
trading facility) in Switzerland. This offering memorandum does not constitute a prospectus pursuant to the FinSA,
and no such prospectus has been or will be prepared for or in connection with the offering of the notes.

**Notice to Prospective Investors in Japan**

The offering has not been and will not be registered under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act of
Japan (Act No. 25 of 1948 of Japan, as amended, the “FIEA”), and the Initial Purchaser will not offer or sell any notes,
directly or indirectly, in Japan or to, or for the benefit of, any resident of Japan (which term as used herein means any
person resident in Japan, including any corporation or other entity organized under the laws of Japan), or to others for
re-offering or resale, directly or indirectly, in Japan or to, or for the benefit of, any resident of Japan, except pursuant
to an exemption from the registration requirements of, and otherwise in compliance with, the FIEA and any other
applicable laws, regulations and ministerial guidelines of Japan.

**Other Relationships**

The initial purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various
activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment
management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. In addition, some of the initial
purchasers and their affiliates have engaged in, and may in the future engage in, investment banking, financing and
other commercial dealings in the ordinary course of business with us or our affiliates. They have received, or may in
the future receive, customary fees and commissions for these transactions. Certain of the initial purchasers and/or their
affiliates have also agreed to provide interim financing to us with respect to a bridge facility to finance a portion of
the Acquisition under certain circumstances in the event that the notes are not released from escrow, for which the
initial purchasers or their respective affiliates will be paid customary fees. In addition, certain of the initial purchasers
and/or their affiliates have committed to act as arrangers, agents and/or lenders under our Senior Credit Facilities and
will receive customary compensation in connection therewith. In addition, SPC Capital Markets, LLC, which is an
initial purchaser in this offering, is an affiliate of Stone Point, one of our Sponsors. In addition, Truist Securities, Inc.,
which is an initial purchaser in this offering, is an affiliate of Truist, a seller under the Acquisition Agreement.

In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the initial purchasers and their affiliates may
make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities)
and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such
investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of ours or our affiliates. Certain of the
initial purchasers or their affiliates that have a lending relationship with us routinely hedge their credit exposure to us
consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, these initial purchasers and their affiliates would
hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the
creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the notes offered hereby. Any such short positions
could adversely affect future trading prices of the notes offered hereby. The initial purchasers and their affiliates may

**Report of Independent Auditors**

To the Management and Board of Managers of Truist Insurance Holdings, LLC

**_Opinion_**

We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Truist Insurance
Holdings, LLC and its subsidiaries (the "Company"), which comprise the consolidated balance
sheets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
of comprehensive income, of changes in members' equity and of cash flows for the years then
ended, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial
statements").

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results
of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

**_Basis for Opinion_**

We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United
States of America (US GAAS). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in
the Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of
our report. We are required to be independent of the Company and to meet our other ethical
responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our audit. We
believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis
for our audit opinion.

**_Responsibilities of Management for the Consolidated Financial Statements_**

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial
statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America, and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the
preparation and fair presentation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to evaluate whether
there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the
Company's ability to continue as a going concern for one year after the date the consolidated
financial statements are available to be issued.

**_Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements_**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial
statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to
issue an auditors' report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of
assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted
in accordance with US GAAS will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of
not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from
error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the
override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial
likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a
reasonable user based on the consolidated financial statements.

T: (704) 344 7500, www.pwc.com/us


-----

In performing an audit in accordance with US GAAS, we:

  - Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the
audit.

  - Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial
statements, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures
responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.

  - Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control.
Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed.

  - Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of
significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall
presentation of the consolidated financial statements.

  - Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the
aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going
concern for a reasonable period of time.

We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other
matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal
control-related matters that we identified during the audit.

###### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

 1. Organization and Business Description

 Business Description

 Truist Insurance Holdings, LLC (“TIH LLC” or the “Company”) is a subsidiary of Truist Financial Corporation (“TFC” or the “Parent”) and is a leading insurance agency / brokerage network in the United States and globally, providing property and casualty, employee benefits, life, and title insurance to businesses and individuals. The Company operates as an agent or broker, and therefore, does not assume underwriting risks.

 In February 2023, Truist Insurance Holdings, Inc. (“TIH Inc.”) was converted into a Delaware Limited Liability Company (the “Partnership Conversion”) named Truist Insurance Holdings, LLC. As a result, the capital stock of TIH Inc. was converted into Common Units of TIH LLC. After the Partnership Conversion, the Company’s operations were conducted through TIH LLC, which is overseen by a Board of Managers. TIH Inc. and TIH LLC are referred to as “TIH” throughout the remainder of the Consolidated Financial Statements.

 Subsequent to the Partnership Conversion, on April 3, 2023, TIH recapitalized a portion of its Common Units into Preferred Units and Class W Units. Refer to Note 9. Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Units and Note 12. Members' Equity for additional information about the Preferred Units and Class W Units, respectively. Historically, the Company’s operations have been included in TFC’s U.S. federal consolidated tax return, certain foreign tax returns, and certain state tax returns. Pursuant to the Partnership Conversion, the Company has shifted from corporate taxation to pass-through taxation. Given the change in the Company's tax status, the comparative financial statements for prior periods are the financial statements of TIH Inc.

 TIH consists of three operating segments: Retail, Wholesale, and Services. The Retail segment provides policy placement services directly to the insured, serving as an intermediary between insurance carriers or wholesale agents and the underlying commercial and individual insureds. In addition to policy placement services, the Retail segment provides risk management and other ancillary services, such as employee benefits administration. The Wholesale segment provides policy placement services to insurance carriers and retail agents, marketing and selling excess and surplus commercial and personal line insurance products through independent agents and brokers. In some cases, the Wholesale segment also provides post-placement administrative and claims management services. The Services segment provides policy placement services (specific to title insurance), as well as services associated with the execution of real estate transactions. In December 2023, the Company announced plans to reorganize the internal reporting of its existing Wholesale operating segment. Refer to Note 18. Subsequent Events for more information. 

 The Company is headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina.

 Basis of Presentation

 The Consolidated Financial Statements have been presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) and have been derived from the Company's accounting records, inclusive of certain allocations of assets, liabilities and overhead costs of the Parent. These financial statements have been


-----

###### prepared on a consolidated basis, inclusive of the legal entities that historically comprised the TIH business. Throughout the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, TIH operated as part of TFC. These Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on a carve-out basis.

 The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements are presented on a stand-alone basis as if the operations of TIH had been conducted independently from TFC, and reflect assumptions, estimates, and allocations made by the Parent to depict TIH on that basis. Accordingly, the Consolidated Financial Statements may not be indicative of the results of TIH had it been a separate stand-alone entity during the periods presented, nor are the results stated herein indicative of what the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows may be in the future.

 The Consolidated Statements of Operations include all revenues and expenses directly attributable to TIH, as well as an allocation of expenses from the Parent for certain support functions provided on a centralized basis related to corporate functions, including finance, enterprise risk, legal, enterprise technology, and other functional activities. The expenses incurred by the Parent for the benefit of TIH have been allocated on a systematic and rational basis, based on either pro rata revenue or headcount. The Company considers the expense allocation methodology and results to be a reasonable reflection of its utilization of services and benefits received. However, the allocations may not reflect the expenses the Company would have incurred if the Company had been a standalone company for the periods presented. The impact of allocated expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations is summarized in Note 17. Related Party Transactions. The Consolidated Balance Sheets also include certain assets and liabilities that have historically been held at the Parent, but which are specifically identifiable and attributable to TIH.

 Historically, cash has been managed through bank accounts controlled by TFC, as well as accounts controlled by TIH. Accordingly, cash controlled by TFC has been excluded from the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and only cash amounts in accounts controlled by the TIH business are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Transfers of cash, both to and from TFC, are reflected as a component of Members' Equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and as a financing activity in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The majority of the Company’s operating cash is held in interest-bearing depository accounts at Truist Bank, a wholly owned subsidiary of TFC. TFC pays certain operating invoices on behalf of TIH. Transfers of cash to TFC for these purposes are reflected as operating activities in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

 All intracompany transactions and accounts within the TIH consolidated entities have been eliminated. All intercompany transactions between TIH and the Parent are considered to be cash settled. Transactions between TIH and the Parent are discussed in Note 17. Related Party Transactions.


-----

###### Revision of Previously Reported Amounts

 The Company has revised the previously reported amounts for the following financial statement line items included within Current assets in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2022, to correct certain immaterial errors that were identified by the Company during the current year:

**(Dollars in millions)** **Previously Reported Balance** **Revised Balance**
###### Cash $ 1,526 $ 1,489 Fiduciary cash 996 1,100 Commissions, fees and other receivables, net 472 509 Fiduciary receivables 1,456 1,352

 These revisions had no impact on Total current assets or Total Assets, as previously reported by the Company as of December 31, 2022. These revisions had the following net impacts to the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2022:

 Previously

###### Cash flows from operating activities: Commissions, fees and other receivables $ (102) $ (112) Net Cash provided by operating activities 626 616

 Cash, inclusive of fiduciary cash, at beginning of period 2,344 2,378 Cash, inclusive of fiduciary cash, at end of period $ 2,522 $ 2,589

 Reclassifications

 In the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company reclassified certain expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The impact of such expenses on prior periods is immaterial and as such, the prior period has not been adjusted.


-----

###### 2. Use of Estimates

 The preparation of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and the underlying assumptions affect the amounts of assets and liabilities reported, disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities and reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change include the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets, recognition of contingent revenues, amortization of deferred costs, equity incentive compensation, and income taxes. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that management believes to be reasonable based on specific circumstances.

 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

 Revenue Recognition

 The Company generates revenues primarily through commissions and fees from insureds, other brokerage firms and insurance carriers.

 Generally, customers within the Retail segment are commercial and individual insured parties. The Retail segment generates revenues by:
 • Identifying, negotiating and placing insurance coverage, principally related to property, casualty, employee benefits and other insurance products (“policy placement services”). These policy placement services may also be provided in conjunction with related and unrelated agents and brokers.
 • Providing risk management consulting services, principally related to property and casualty insurance (“risk management services”).
 • Providing consulting and administration services related to employee benefits (“employee benefits services”).

 Generally, customers within the Wholesale segment are retail brokerage firms or insurance carriers. The Wholesale segment generates revenues by:
 • Identifying, negotiating and placing insurance coverage, and providing related tools, resources and services to retail brokerage firms, principally related to excess and surplus, specialized or hard to place property, casualty, life, employee benefits and other insurance products (“policy placement services”). These services may be provided through, or in conjunction with, related and unrelated agents and brokers. 
 • Acting as an agent or broker for insurance carriers by providing services such as sales, marketing, selecting, negotiating, underwriting, servicing and placing insurance coverage on their behalf (“policy placement services”).
 • Providing claims administration services and other post-placement administrative services for insurance carriers (“claims administration and other post-placement administrative services”).

 Generally, customers within the Services segment are commercial and individual insured parties. The Services segment generates revenues by:


-----

###### • Identifying, negotiating and placing title insurance (“policy placement services”).
 • Providing settlement, recording, escrow and other trustee services in conjunction with real estate transactions (“closing services”).
 • Acting as a qualified intermediary in facilitating the exchange of properties and providing escrow services in conjunction with Internal Revenue Code Section 1031 Exchanges (“1031 Exchange Services”).

 Refer to Note 4. Revenue Recognition for more information.

 Commissions and Fees

 The Company earns commissions based on a percentage of premiums paid by insured parties, or contractually determined fees from customers based on an agreed-upon level of service, usually in lieu of commissions. Commissions are recognized at the effective date of the bound policy and generally are based on a percentage of premiums paid by the insured for insurance coverage or employee headcount for employer sponsored benefit plans. Commissions depend upon a large number of factors, including the type of risk being placed, the particular insurance carrier’s demand, the expected loss experience of the particular risk of coverage, and historical benchmarks surrounding the level of effort necessary for the Company to place and service the insurance contract. Rather than being tied to the amount of premiums, fees are most often based on an expected level of effort to provide services.

 Most insurance premiums are subject to cancellations; therefore, commissions are recognized net of estimated policy cancellations, which are based upon the Company's historical cancellations. Commissions and fees for policy placement services are earned at a point in time upon the effective date of bound insurance coverage, as no performance obligation exists after coverage is bound. Any endorsement or other modification made to a policy is treated as a new contract with revenue recognized on the later of the endorsement binding date or the effective date of the modification. Commissions and fees for other services such as risk management, employee benefits management and administration, or claims administration services are generally recognized over time as the services are performed.

 In situations where multiple performance obligations exist within a contract, the Company estimates the stand- alone selling price for each separate performance obligation and allocates the transaction price accordingly. The corresponding revenue is recognized as the performance obligations are fulfilled. 

 Supplemental Revenues

 Certain insurance carriers may pay the Company additional revenues for the volume of premiums placed with them and for insights into the Company's sales pipeline, sales capabilities, or risk selection knowledge. These amounts are in excess of the commission and fee revenues discussed above, and not all insurance policies placed by the Company with insurance carriers are eligible for supplemental revenues. Unlike contingent revenues, discussed below, these revenues are primarily a fixed amount or fixed percentage of premium of the underlying eligible insurance contracts. For supplemental revenue contracts based on a fixed percentage of premium, the obligation to the carrier is substantially completed upon the effective date of the underlying


-----

###### insurance contract and revenue is fully earned at that time. For supplemental revenue contracts based on a fixed amount, revenue is recognized ratably over the contract period consistent with the performance of the Company's obligations, generally over an annual term. These revenues are received on a quarterly or annual basis. 

 Contingent Revenues

 Contingent revenues are generated from contracts between the Company and insurance carriers for which the Company is compensated for certain growth, profitability, or other performance-based metrics. These amounts are variable and in excess of the commission and fee revenues discussed above, and not all policies placed with participating insurance carriers are eligible for contingent revenues. The Company's performance obligation of achieving these metrics is satisfied over time, and revenue is therefore recognized over time using a time-based measure of progress.

 Accordingly, the Company must estimate the amount of consideration that will be received, such that a significant reversal of revenue is not probable. The Company determines estimates each period on a contract- by-contract or carrier-by-carrier basis, where available. Because the expectation of the contingent revenue amounts to be earned can vary from period to period, especially in contracts sensitive to loss ratios, the estimates might change significantly from quarter to quarter. Variable consideration is recognized when the Company concludes, based on all the facts and information available at the reporting date, that it is probable that a significant revenue reversal will not occur in future periods.

 Depending on performance, the Company may be required to return contingent commissions to the insurance carrier. When such amounts are deemed probable and reasonably estimable, the Company records a contingent liability within Accounts payable and accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 Third-Party Producer Costs

 Third-party producer costs are excluded from gross revenues in the determination of total revenues. Third-party producer costs represent commissions paid to unrelated agents and brokers with respect to the placement of certain insurance policies. The Company recognizes this contra-revenue in the same manner as the commission revenue to which it relates.

 Deferred Costs

 The Company incurs costs to provide policy placement and other services. Those costs are either (i) costs to obtain a contract, (ii) costs to fulfill a contract, or (iii) all other costs. Refer to Note 4. Revenue Recognition for more information.

 (i) Costs to obtain – The Company defers certain costs to obtain customer contracts, primarily incremental commissions paid to internal producers on new business. These incremental costs are deferred and amortized over a 15-year period. For all other incremental costs incurred to obtain customer contracts, the Company has applied the practical expedient to recognize the incremental


-----

###### costs of obtaining contracts as an expense when incurred, as the amortization period of the assets that otherwise would have been recognized is one year or less. When amortized, these incremental costs are included in Compensation and benefits in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. (ii) Costs to fulfill – The Company incurs costs to fulfill a contract (or anticipated contract) with a customer that are expected to be recovered in the future. These costs relate to compensation and benefits of internal producers and related support staff who perform policy placement services, and are incurred prior to the effective date of the underlying policy. Deferrable costs to fulfill relate to fulfillment activities, which include collecting underwriting information from insureds or agents of the insureds, assessing their insurance needs and negotiating their placement with one or more insurance carriers, and underwriting their risk. Deferrable costs to fulfill incurred prior to the policy effective date are capitalized and expensed on the policy effective date. (iii) Other costs that are not costs to obtain or fulfill are expensed as incurred. Examples include other operating costs such as rent, utilities, management costs, overhead costs, legal and other professional fees, technology costs, insurance related costs, communication and advertising, and travel and entertainment. Depreciation and amortization are expensed over the useful lives of the underlying assets.

 Fiduciary Cash, Fiduciary Receivables and Fiduciary Liabilities

 The Company presents certain assets and liabilities that arise from activities in which the Company engages as an intermediary, where it collects premiums from insureds to remit to insurance carriers or other agents/brokers, holds funds from insurance carriers to distribute to insureds for claims on covered losses, and holds refunds due to customers, as fiduciary assets and fiduciary liabilities.

 Fiduciary cash in the Consolidated Balance Sheets represents funds in the Company's possession collected from insureds to be remitted to insurance carriers or other agents/brokers, and funds from insurance carriers to be distributed to insureds for the settlement of claims or refunds. The Company separately accounts for and holds these funds in a fiduciary capacity until disbursement, and the use of such funds is restricted by laws in certain states and foreign jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Various state and foreign agencies regulate insurance brokers and provide specific requirements that limit the type of investments that may be made with such funds. Accordingly, the Company may invest these funds in cash and money market fund accounts. The Company may earn interest income on these funds where allowed by state law. Such interest income is included in Investment income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The net change in fiduciary cash is represented by the net change in fiduciary receivables and fiduciary liabilities, and is presented as Net cash provided by financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

 Uncollected premiums are presented as Fiduciary receivables in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Likewise, payables to insurance carriers are consolidated and presented as Fiduciary liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 The carrying amounts of Fiduciary cash, Fiduciary receivables, and Fiduciary liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets approximate fair value because of the short-term duration of these instruments.


-----

###### Commissions, Fees, and Other Receivables

 Commissions, fees, and other receivables are net of allowances for estimated policy cancellations and expected credit losses. The allowance for estimated policy cancellations was $29 million and $32 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which represents a reserve for future reversals in commission and fee revenues related to the estimated cancellation of placed insurance policies that were in force as of each year end. The allowance for expected credit losses was $9 million as of both December 31, 2023 and 2022. The Company establishes the allowance for estimated policy cancellations through a charge against Commissions and fees, and the allowance for expected credit losses through a charge to Other operating expenses.

 The Company records the allowance for estimated policy cancellations upon initial recognition of receivables. The allowance for estimated policy cancellations is based on historical cancellation experience, with adjustments for known circumstances, when relevant. The Company records the allowance for expected credit losses upon the initial recognition of receivables. The allowance for credit losses represents the best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses based on a combination of factors, including an assessment of historical loss rates, current and expected economic conditions, aging of outstanding receivables, and other qualitative and quantitative analyses. Balances are written off against the allowance for credit losses when the Company determines that the balances are not recoverable. Both allowances are based on estimates and assumptions which could change in the future as more information becomes known and could impact the amounts reported and disclosed herein. The Company periodically reviews the adequacy of these allowances and makes adjustments as necessary.

 Fixed Assets

 Fixed assets consist primarily of software, computer equipment, leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures, vehicles, and buildings. The Company carries fixed assets at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the improvements’ estimated useful lives or the lease term. Expenditures for capital improvements are capitalized, and expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed to operations as incurred. Upon sale or retirement of fixed assets, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts.

 Refer to Note 8. Fixed Assets for more information.

 Income Taxes

 The Company’s income tax expense is calculated based on expected income tax rates in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates and requires the use of management’s estimates and judgments. Deferred tax assets and liabilities (“DTAs” and “DTLs”) result from differences between the timing of the recognition of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and for income tax purposes. They are measured using the applicable enacted income tax rates in the periods in which they are expected to be realized.


-----

###### In assessing the realizability of DTAs, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the DTA will not be realized. The Company’s ability to realize its DTAs depends upon the generation of sufficient future taxable income to allow for the utilization of its net operating loss carryforwards and future deductible temporary differences. The Company records valuation allowances to reduce the carrying value of DTAs to amounts that it expects are more-likely-than-not to be realized.

 The determination of accruals for unrecognized tax benefits includes the application of complex tax laws. Management judgment is required in determining the gross unrecognized tax benefits’ related liabilities. Accruals for unrecognized tax benefits are established when, despite the belief that tax positions are supportable, there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold, which is a tax position that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority.

 Historically, the Company’s operations have been included in TFC’s U.S. federal consolidated tax return, certain foreign tax returns, and certain state tax returns. As a result of the Partnership Conversion, the Company has shifted from corporate taxation to pass-through taxation. This change in tax status resulted in the derecognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, as well as unrecognized tax benefit reserves, through income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Operations upon Partnership Conversion. Following the Partnership Conversion, TIH is predominantly comprised of partnerships and disregarded entities held by other partnerships – all of which are entity structures that are not subject to federal tax for purposes of each legal entity’s separate financial statements. As such, for periods subsequent to the Partnership Conversion, federal income taxes will not be allocated to TIH, its subsidiary partnerships, or subsidiary disregarded entities for purposes of these financial statements, with the exception of one corporate entity and two foreign corporations for which relevant federal and foreign taxes will be considered on a stand-alone basis. For these corporate entities, the applicable taxes will continue to be reflected within these Consolidated Financial Statements. For the purposes of these Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company’s income tax provision with respect to such corporate-form entities (including TIH prior to the Partnership Conversion) was computed as if the Company filed separate tax returns (i.e., as if the Company had not been included in the consolidated income tax return group with TFC). The separate-return method applies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of each member of a consolidated tax group as if the group member were a separate taxpayer. As a result, actual tax transactions included in the Consolidated Financial Statements of TFC may not be included in these Consolidated Financial Statements. Further, the Company’s tax results as presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements may not be reflective of the results that the Company expects to generate in the future. Also, the tax treatment of certain items reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements may not be reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements and tax returns of TFC. It is conceivable that items such as net operating losses (“NOLs”), other deferred taxes, uncertain tax positions and valuation allowances may exist in the Consolidated Financial Statements that may or may not exist in TFC’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Additionally, state taxes attributable to a limited number of states which tax the income of a partnership at the entity level will continue to be reflected within these Consolidated Financial Statements.

 Prior to the Partnership Conversion, the Company had a tax sharing agreement with TFC that provided for payment to the Company for NOLs and tax credits in the year generated. The Company assumed that, in the event a tax attribute was reimbursed or utilized by TFC on a consolidated or combined return, the Company


-----

###### realized the benefits of the tax attribute and recorded the utilization as a current benefit and a transfer to TFC. This resulted in a current benefit generated in 2023.

 Refer to Note 11. Income Taxes for more information.

 Business Combinations

 The Company uses the acquisition method of accounting for acquired businesses. Under the acquisition method, the Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the operations of an acquired business starting on the acquisition date of the business. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective estimated fair values at the date of the acquisition. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Significant judgment is often required in estimating the fair value of assets acquired, particularly intangible assets. As a result, in the case of significant acquisitions, the Company normally obtains the assistance of third-party valuation specialists in estimating fair values of tangible and intangible assets. The fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on expectations and assumptions about the future, considering the perspective of market participants. While management believes those expectations and assumptions are reasonable, they are inherently uncertain. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions.

 Refer to Note 5. Business Combinations for more information.

 Goodwill and Amortizable Intangible Assets

 Goodwill and amortizable intangible assets represent the excess of cost over the estimated fair value of net tangible assets of acquired businesses. Primary intangible assets are classified as either goodwill, customer relationships, trade names, non-compete agreements, or technology. Non-compete agreements and customer relationships, which consist of customer-related assets, are amortized in proportion to the realization of their economic benefit over their estimated useful lives ranging from two to twenty-five years. Trade names are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives ranging from two to fifteen years, and technology intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives ranging from two to five years. Goodwill is not amortized. The establishment of goodwill, customer relationships, trade names, non-compete agreements, and technology, and the determination of estimated useful lives are primarily based on valuations the Company receives from qualified independent third-party valuation specialists. The calculations of these amounts are based on estimates and assumptions using historical and projected financial information and recognized valuation methods. Different estimates or assumptions could produce different results. The Company carries identifiable intangible assets at cost, less accumulated amortization, in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 The Company reviews goodwill for impairment at least annually and more frequently if business circumstances suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. The Company performs such impairment reviews at the reporting unit level. The Company may initially perform a qualitative analysis to determine if it is more likely than not that the goodwill balance is impaired. The qualitative assessment considers all relevant


-----

###### factors specific to the reporting units, including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and relevant entity-specific events. If a qualitative assessment is not performed or if a determination is made that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, then the Company will perform a quantitative analysis. The fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a non-cash impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, with the loss not exceeding the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.

 During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Services reporting unit observed declines in its financial forecasts due to a decline in commercial real estate transactions attributable to rising interest rates. Therefore, the Company performed a quantitative impairment test over the Services reporting unit pursuant to which it recorded goodwill impairment of $195 million.

 The Company performed a qualitative assessment as part of its annual goodwill impairment analysis with respect to the Retail and Wholesale reporting units and concluded it was more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit exceed its respective carrying amount. Accordingly, there was no indication of impairment and the quantitative impairment test for the Retail and Wholesale reporting units was not performed. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company performed a qualitative assessment for its annual goodwill impairment analysis and concluded it was more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit exceed its respective carrying amount. Accordingly, there was no indication of impairment and the quantitative impairment test was not performed for any reporting unit.

 Refer to Note 6. Goodwill for more information.

 The carrying value of amortizable intangible assets attributable to each asset group is periodically reviewed by management to determine if there are events or changes in circumstances that would indicate it is more likely than not that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Accordingly, if there are any such changes in circumstances during the year, the Company assesses the carrying value of the amortizable intangible assets by considering the estimated future undiscounted cash flows generated by the corresponding asset group. Any impairment identified through this assessment may require that the carrying value of related amortizable intangible assets be adjusted and charged against current period earnings as a component of Other operating expenses. There were no impairments recorded to Amortizable intangible assets, net in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in either of the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The determinations of undiscounted cash flows used to test the recoverability of an intangible asset and the fair value of such asset are based on estimates and assumptions related to the amount and timing of future cash flows and future interest rates. Such estimates and assumptions could change in the future as more information becomes known, which could impact the amounts reported and disclosed herein.

 Refer to Note 7. Amortizable Intangible Assets for more information.

###### Equity Incentive Compensation

 Parent Equity Incentive Plans

 The Company’s employees have historically participated in TFC’s equity incentive plans (the “TFC Plans”) that provide for the grant of Restricted Stock Awards (“RSAs”), Restricted Stock Units, (“RSUs”) and Performance Share Units (“PSUs”). In addition, during 2022, TFC adopted an employee stock purchase plan (the “ESPP”). Compensation cost has been allocated to the Company based on the awards and terms previously granted to TIH employees. The Company determines compensation cost associated with RSUs and PSUs based on the fair value of underlying TFC common stock on the date of grant less the present value of expected dividends that will be forgone during the vesting period. Compensation cost for RSAs and RSUs is generally recognized over the vesting period taking into account retirement eligibility. Forfeitures are recognized when they occur. For PSUs, compensation cost is recognized over the vesting period after considering the number of awards expected to vest based on the estimated probability of achieving the associated performance targets.

 Refer to Note 13. Equity Incentive Compensation for more information.

 TIH Equity Incentive Plan

 On April 3, 2023, the Board of Managers of TIH adopted several equity incentive plans (referred to collectively as the “TIH Plans”) pursuant to which it may issue Phantom Equity Units, Phantom Profits Interests and Profits Interests to TIH employees and other service providers. The terms of each are further described in Note 13. Equity Incentive Compensation. 

 For all awards, compensation cost is recognized over the applicable requisite service period using the graded vesting method, taking into account accelerated vesting provisions for retirement-eligible employees (applicable to the Phantom Equity Units only). Forfeitures are recorded when they occur.

 Preferred Units

 Preferred Units that are mandatorily redeemable at specified or determinable dates or otherwise require settlement by issuing a variable number of Common Units are classified as a liability. Preferred Units that are mandatorily redeemable and have a fixed redemption amount and fixed redemption date are accreted to the redemption value using the effective interest method. Such accretion, as well as any distributions, are included in Interest in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations.

 Refer to Note 9. Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Units, for more information.

 Financial Instruments

 The Company does not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to financial risks. The Company reviews the terms of all financial instruments it issues, including all forms of debt and equity financing arrangements, to determine if such instruments are themselves derivatives in their entirety. Each instrument that is not a derivative in its entirety is assessed to determine whether it contains embedded derivatives that are required to


-----

###### be bifurcated and accounted for as a derivative financial instrument. The embedded derivative is bifurcated from the host contract and accounted for as a freestanding derivative at fair value if (i) the combined instrument is not accounted for in its entirety at fair value, (ii) the terms of the embedded derivative are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the host contract, and (iii) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative would qualify as a derivative instrument. Changes in fair value of any bifurcated embedded derivative are recorded in earnings.

 Additionally, the Company may issue freestanding equity-linked contracts when entering into financing arrangements. The characteristics of such instruments, including the ability of the Company to control the method of settlement, are assessed under relevant guidance to determine if classification as a component of Members' equity or liabilities is appropriate.

 The Company assessed all arrangements it entered into during the year ended December 31, 2023 and identified no embedded derivatives that required bifurcation; however, there were freestanding equity-linked contracts issued in connection with the April 2023 Partnership Conversion. Refer to Note 12. Members' Equity for additional information. The Company did not enter into arrangements during the year ended December 31, 2022 that required assessment.

 Retirement Plans

 Parent-Sponsored Plans

 Certain of the Company’s employees participate in defined benefit pension plans sponsored by TFC, which also include participants of other TFC businesses. The Company’s participation in these plans is accounted for as participation in multiemployer benefit plans. Accordingly, the Company does not record an asset or liability to recognize any portion of the funded status of such plans. The related pension expense is based on an allocation of all components of net periodic benefit costs associated with the Company's employees and is reported within Compensation and benefits in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. In addition, TFC has voluntary defined contribution plans for the benefit of substantially all Company employees meeting certain eligibility requirements. Expenses for defined contribution plans are recorded when services are rendered by employees.

 TIH-Sponsored Plans

 In addition to the Parent-sponsored plans described above, the Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans for certain internal producers in the Retail segment. These defined benefit pension plans are unfunded. Calculation of the obligations and related expenses under these plans requires the use of actuarial valuation methods and assumptions.

 The Company uses the corridor approach for the recognition of actuarial gains and losses resulting from variances between actual results and such actuarial assumptions. The corridor approach defers these amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Such unrecognized gains and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are amortized as a component of Compensation and benefits in the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the average remaining service period of plan participants, when the


-----

###### net gains and losses exceed 10% of the projected benefit obligation at the beginning of the year. Prior service costs and credits are similarly charged or credited to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently amortized over the average remaining service period of employees expected to receive benefits under the plan.

 Refer to Note 14. Retirement Plans for more information.

 Retention Bonus Arrangements

 To retain top talent, the Company grants upfront bonuses in the form of forgivable loans to certain employees, that are generally subject to claw-back over a service period of three to seven years. Upon initial payment, the Company records a prepaid asset that is amortized to compensation expense as the future services are rendered over the duration of the requisite service period. If the minimum requisite service is not rendered upon an employee leaving the Company, the Company attempts to recover any unearned portion of compensation, and subsequently reverses any previously recognized compensation cost when successful in recovering amounts. These retention bonus arrangements were discontinued with limited exceptions during the year ended December 31, 2023, as the new TIH Plans are expected to augment the retention bonus arrangements in the future.

 Non-Controlling Interests

 Non-controlling interests represent third parties’ ownership interests in certain consolidated subsidiaries. The Company evaluates its non-controlling interests to determine whether there are any redemption features that require presentation outside of permanent equity. There are currently no outstanding non-controlling interests that the Company may be required to repurchase under put options or other contractual redemption requirements that are not solely within its control. Accordingly, non-controlling interests are presented as a component of permanent equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 Contingencies

 Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines, penalties, and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. The Company does not discount the contingent liabilities recorded. Outcomes associated with contingent liabilities may differ from the Company’s estimates, resulting in an impact, positive or negative, on earnings.

 Refer to Note 15. Commitments and Contingencies for more information.

 Leases

 The Company assesses at inception of a contract if it contains a lease. This assessment is based on: (i) whether the contract involves the use of a distinct identified asset, (ii) whether the Company obtains the right to substantially all the economic benefit from the use of the asset throughout the period, and (iii) whether the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset. If these criteria are met and a lease has been identified, the Company accounts for the contract as a lease under relevant accounting guidance.


-----

###### Substantially all of the Company's leases are classified as operating leases, and they primarily represent real estate leases for office space used to conduct the Company's business\, that expire on various dates through June 30, 2032. Leases generally have terms ranging between 1 to 10 years, and contain renewal options and escalation clauses based upon increases in the lessors’ operating expenses and other charges.

 The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which is primarily composed of the initial lease liability, plus any initial direct costs incurred, less any lease incentives received. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the minimum lease payments through the term of the lease. Minimum lease payments are discounted to present value using the Company’s incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date, which approximates the rate of interest the Company expects to pay on a secured borrowing in an amount equal to the lease payments for the underlying asset under similar terms and economic conditions. The Company has elected not to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that have a term of twelve months or less at the commencement date. The effect of short-term leases on the Company’s right-of-use asset and lease liability balances would not be material.

 Refer to Note 16. Leases for more information.

 4. Revenue Recognition

 The following tables present revenues disaggregated by operating segment and revenue source. Amounts presented under “Other” include any income not attributable to operating segments. 
 Year Ended December 31, 2023

**(Dollars in millions)** **Retail** **Wholesale** **Services** **Other** **Total**

-----

###### “insurable exposure units”, which are units that insurance carriers use to measure or express insurance exposed to risk (such as property values, or sales and payroll levels) to determine what premium to charge the insured. Insurance carriers establish these premium rates based upon many factors, including loss experience, risk profile and reinsurance rates paid by such insurance carriers, none of which the Company controls. (2) Fee revenues relate to compensation for services other than policy placement services and fees negotiated in lieu of commissions. (3) Supplemental and contingent commissions include additional commissions over base commissions received from insurance carriers, primarily based on one or multiple of the following metrics: volume, growth, retention, profit, underwriting results, or loss ratios. (4) Investment income consists primarily of interest on cash and fiduciary cash. There was an immaterial amount of investment income for the year ended December 31, 2022. (5) Other income consists primarily of income from non-recurring legal settlements and other miscellaneous income.

 During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the amount of revenue recognized related to performance obligations satisfied in a previous period, inclusive of changes due to estimates, was approximately $27 million. These balances primarily consist of variable consideration received on contingent commission arrangements.

 Receivables, Contract Assets, and Contract Liabilities

 The balances of receivables, contract assets, and contract liabilities arising from contracts with customers as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:
 As of December 31,

**(Dollars in millions)** **2023** **2022**
###### Receivables, net (1) $ 275 $ 277 Contract assets, net 243 232 Contract liabilities 77 71 (1) The Company has revised the previously reported amount of Receivables, net as of December 31, 2022. Refer to Note 1. Organization and Business Description for more information.

 Contract assets arise when the Company recognizes revenue for amounts which have not yet been billed and are reflected in Commissions, fees and other receivables, net in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Deferred revenue (i.e., contract liabilities) relates to payments received in advance of performance under the contract, before the transfer of a good or service to the customer and is presented as Deferred revenue – current or Deferred revenue – noncurrent in the Consolidated Balance Sheets based on when the associated revenue is expected to be recognized.

 Remaining Performance Obligations

 Remaining performance obligations (i.e., contract liabilities) represent the portion of the contract price for which work has not been performed but cash has been received. As of December 31, 2023, the aggregate amount of the contract price allocated to remaining performance obligations was $77 million.


-----

###### The estimated revenue expected to be recognized in the future related to performance obligations that are unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) at the end of the reporting period is as follows:

**(Dollars in millions)** **Retail** **Wholesale** **Total**
###### 2024 $ 9 $ 39 $ 48 2025 — 16 16 2026 — 7 7 2027 — 3 3 2028 — 2 2 Thereafter — 1 1 Total $ 9 $ 68 $ 77

 Other Assets and Deferred Costs

 Incremental costs to obtain contracts – The Company capitalizes costs incurred to obtain contracts as “deferred contract costs”, which are included in Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Deferred contract costs were $183 million and $157 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company deferred $45 million and $32 million of incremental costs to obtain customer contracts, respectively. The Company recorded expense of $19 million and $17 million associated with the incremental costs to obtain customer contracts for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

 Costs to fulfill contracts – The Company capitalizes costs incurred to fulfill contracts as “deferred contract costs”, which are included in Other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Deferred contract costs were $47 million and $44 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Capitalized fulfillment costs are amortized to expense on the policy effective date. The Company had net deferrals of $3 million and $10 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These net deferrals consist of current period costs related to performance obligations yet to be fulfilled, net of the expense of previously deferred contract fulfillment costs associated with performance obligations that were satisfied in the current period. Net expenses occur when the expense recognized within the current period exceeds the current period costs that were subject to deferral in the current period.

 5. Business Combinations

 2023 Acquisitions

 The Company did not complete any business combinations during the year ended December 31, 2023.

 2022 Acquisitions

 During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company acquired the net assets of two insurance agencies, Kensington Vanguard National Land Services (“Kensington Vanguard”) and Centerstone Insurance and Financial Services, Inc. (“BenefitMall”). The Company expanded its presence in the title insurance market by


-----

###### acquiring Kensington Vanguard and broadened the selection of products and services offered by its Wholesale segment by acquiring BenefitMall, one of the nation’s leading employee benefits wholesale general insurance agencies. In both transactions, the Company purchased 100% of the outstanding equity interests therein. However, with respect to Kensington Vanguard, the Company acquired certain less-than-wholly-owned entities, resulting in the recognition of non-controlling interests (which is described further below).

 The following table summarizes the total consideration transferred and non-controlling interests recognized as of the acquisition date for each transaction:

 (Dollars in millions) Non Operating Effective Date of Controlling Name Segment Acquisition Cash Paid Interests Total
 Kensington Vanguard National Land Services March 1, 2022 $ 325 $ 22 $ 347 Services
 BenefitMall Wholesale September 1, 2022 845  —  845 Total $ 1,170 $ 22 $ 1,192


-----

###### The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the aggregate assets and liabilities acquired as of the date of each acquisition:


**(Dollars in millions)**


###### Kensington Vanguard National Land Services BenefitMall Total


###### The identifiable intangible assets acquired are being amortized over a weighted average term of 14 years based on the estimated duration of economic benefits received.

 Goodwill of $197 million, resulting from the acquisition of Kensington Vanguard, was assigned to the Services segment. This goodwill was subsequently impaired during 2023; refer to Note 6. Goodwill for more information. Goodwill of $483 million, resulting from the acquisition of BenefitMall, was assigned to the Wholesale segment. Goodwill amounts are net of any opening balance sheet adjustments within the allowable measurement period. Of the total goodwill of $680 million acquired in 2022, the amount deductible as of December 31, 2022 for income tax purposes was $131 million.
 The non-controlling interests recognized in conjunction with the acquisition of Kensington Vanguard arose from acquired joint ventures, and were valued at $22 million using a market approach based on the multiple implied by the acquisition. For the acquisitions completed during 2022, the results of operations since the acquisition dates have been consolidated with those of the Company.

 Additionally, in connection with the 2022 acquisition of Kensington Vanguard, the Company made upfront


-----

###### retention bonus payments that vest over a period of time based on continued employment over such defined time period. Certain individuals are eligible to receive additional amounts based on revenue growth targets as well as continued employment. Based on the terms of the arrangements, the Company concluded the payments represent compensation for post-acquisition services, to be accounted for separately from the business combination. Transaction costs associated with the 2022 acquisitions of Kensington Vanguard and BenefitMall were approximately $19 million and are included within Other operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

 6. Goodwill

 The changes in the carrying value of goodwill by operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 are as follows:

**(Dollars in millions)** **Retail** **Wholesale** **Services** **Total**
###### Balance as of January 1, 2022 $ 1,095 $ 1,964 $ — $ 3,059 Goodwill of acquired businesses (1) — 486 197 683 Balance as of December 31, 2022 1,095 2,450 197 3,742 Goodwill adjustments during measurement period (2) — 11 (2) 9 Goodwill impairment — — (195) (195) Balance as of December 31, 2023 $ 1,095 $ 2,461 $ — $ 3,556 (1) There were measurement period adjustments resulting in a $3 million increase to Goodwill recorded during 2022 related to the 2021 acquisition of Constellation Affiliated Partners. (2) There were measurement period adjustments resulting in an increase to Goodwill in the Wholesale operating segment related to the 2022 acquisition of BenefitMall, and a decrease to Goodwill in the Services operating segment related to the 2022 acquisition of Kensington Vanguard.

 During 2023, the Services reporting unit observed declines in forecasted income due to a decline in commercial and residential real estate transactions attributable to rising interest rates. The Company concluded that these factors were indicative of a triggering event that required the Company to perform an interim quantitative goodwill impairment assessment.

 Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes on the relevant reporting unit. The Company performed a valuation of the Services reporting unit using a combination of an income approach using a discounted cash flow methodology and a market approach using publicly traded company multiples in similar businesses. The goodwill impairment analysis required significant judgments to calculate the fair value of the Services reporting unit, including internally developed forecasts, estimations of the Services reporting unit’s long-term rate of growth, risk and control premiums, the discount rate, identification of relevant comparable public companies, and selection of relevant market multiples within an identified range. The Company considered historical experience and all available information at the time the valuation was performed. Assumptions are subject to a high degree of judgment and uncertainty.


-----

###### The results of the quantitative impairment assessment indicated that the carrying value of the Services reporting unit exceeded its fair value. As a result, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment loss of $195 million in the year ended December 31, 2023, which reduced the goodwill in the Services reporting unit to zero.

 7. Amortizable Intangible Assets

 Amortizable intangible assets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 consisted of the following:

###### During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company consummated transactions in which substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired was concentrated in Customer relationships. As a result, such transactions were accounted for as asset acquisitions rather than business combinations. Cash paid for these intangibles was $23 million.

 The Company recorded $134 million and $127 million of amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The following table presents the estimated amortization expense of identifiable intangibles as of December 31, 2023 for the next five years and thereafter:

Goodwill, during 2023, the Company concluded that a triggering event had occurred with respect to the Services reporting unit, which necessitated a quantitative impairment assessment of the goodwill assigned to such reporting unit. In performing its assessment, the Company concluded the estimated

###### future undiscounted cash flows of intangible assets in the reporting unit exceeded their carrying amount, and as a result, no impairment charge on intangible assets was recorded.

 8. Fixed Assets

 Fixed assets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 consisted of the following:

**(Dollars in millions)** **Estimated Useful Life** **2023** **2022**
###### Software and computer equipment 3-5 Years $ 122 $ 113 Buildings and improvements 40 Years 36 9 Furniture and fixtures, vehicles 3-15 Years 35 38

 The Company recorded $23 million of depreciation expense for fixed assets in both years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.

 9. Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Units

 Subsequent to the Partnership Conversion, a portion of TFC’s existing ownership interest in the Company was recapitalized into mandatorily redeemable Preferred Units with a face value and initial liquidation preference of $5 billion, representing 5 million shares with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share. The Company concluded the face amount of the Preferred Units should be recorded as a dividend to TFC. 

 The Preferred Units are entitled to quarterly distributions which accrue at a rate of 8.25% per annum whether or not declared. Compounding occurs on each quarterly distribution date to the extent payments are not made. The Preferred Units are mandatorily redeemable on the 50th anniversary of the issuance date or upon occurrence of liquidity events including an Initial Public Offering (“IPO”) or Change of Control meeting certain criteria as defined in the Amended and Restated TIH LLC Agreement dated April 3, 2023 (the “LLC Agreement”). TIH may call the Preferred Units at any time five years after issuance thereof, and TFC may put the Preferred Units back to the Company at any time when its ownership of the Company falls below 50%. In all cases, the Preferred Units are required to be repurchased at the liquidation preference, including accrued but unpaid dividends.

 Due to the mandatory redemption feature, the Preferred Units are classified as liabilities rather than as a component of equity, with the preferred annual returns being accrued and recorded as Interest in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. During the year ended December 31, 2023, TIH recognized interest expense of $315 million related to the Preferred Units, of which $210 million was paid in cash during the


-----

###### period. Interest not yet paid is recorded as accrued interest and included as a component of Accounts payable and accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2023.

 If the Company was required to redeem the Preferred Units at December 31, 2023, it would be required to pay $5,105 million, which is equal to the liquidation preference on the Preferred Units, including accrued but unpaid preferred returns. The maximum amount that the Company could be required to pay to redeem the Preferred Units on the mandatory redemption date is equal to the liquidation preference on the Preferred Units at such time, including accrued but unpaid preferred returns.

 10. Revolving Credit Facility

 On April 3, 2023, TIH entered into a Credit Agreement with TFC. Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, TFC has made available a $700 million credit facility from which the Company may draw revolving loans and letters of credit at any time through the fifth anniversary of the issuance thereof (the “Credit Facility”). Letters of credit are subject to a $200 million sublimit. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had not drawn on the Credit Facility. In addition, the unused portion of the Credit Facility is subject to a quarterly commitment fee that varies between 0.125% and 0.35% per annum, based on an agreed-upon leverage ratio. As of December 31, 2023, the commitment fee was 0.30%.

 Draws on the Credit Facility are permitted in U.S. dollars and interest is variable at a rate based on Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) or a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (i) the prime lending rate, (ii) the overnight federal funds rate plus 0.50% or (iii) one-month Term SOFR plus 1.00%, plus an applicable margin of up to 1.25%. The minimum base rate on draws bearing the base rate is 1.00%. Term SOFR loans bear an applicable margin of up to 2.25%.

 11. Income Taxes

 As discussed in Note 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, as a result of the Partnership Conversion during 2023, TIH is now predominantly composed of partnerships and disregarded entities held by other partnerships. As such, for periods after the Partnership Conversion, federal income taxes will not be allocated to TIH LLC, its subsidiary partnerships, or subsidiary disregarded entities for purposes of these Consolidated Financial Statements. Further, a limited number of states tax the income of partnerships at the entity level, driving a low state effective tax rate for the Company. TIH does include one corporate entity and two foreign corporations for which relevant federal and foreign taxes are considered on a stand-alone basis and reflected within these Consolidated Financial Statements, if applicable.

 Prior to the Partnership Conversion, the Company did not file separate income tax returns and was included in the federal and state income tax returns of TFC, filing in foreign jurisdictions in accordance with applicable consolidation rules. The income tax expense or benefit presented has been determined on a separate return basis as if the Company filed a separate income tax return in all periods presented. Prior to the Partnership Conversion, the Company had a tax sharing agreement with TFC that provided for payment to the Company for NOLs and tax credits in the year generated. The Company assumes that, in the event a tax attribute is reimbursed or utilized by TFC on a consolidated or combined return, the Company has realized the benefits of


-----

###### the tax attribute and records the utilization as a current benefit and a transfer to TFC. This resulted in a current benefit generated in 2023.

 Given that the year ended December 31, 2022 took place prior to the Partnership Conversion, the resulting provision for income taxes for that period includes the impacts of U.S. corporate taxation. In comparison, the provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2023 is reflective of the discretely calculated corporate tax impacts for January and February 2023 (prior to the Partnership Conversion) of $29 million, the tax benefit associated with the corporate deferred tax liability transfer to the Parent of $166 million, the tax benefit associated with the transfer of the unrecognized tax benefit to the Parent of $1 million, as well as tax impacts attributable to the remaining ten months in the year, calculated on a post Partnership Conversion basis.

 TFC’s federal income tax returns are no longer subject to assessment by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for taxable years prior to 2020. With limited exceptions, TFC is no longer subject to assessment by state and local taxing authorities for taxable years prior to 2018.

 Income tax (benefit) expense consists of the following:
 Year Ended December 31,

**(Dollars in millions)** **2023** **2022**
###### Federal Current $ (20) $ 122 Deferred (95)  — Total (115)  122 State: Current (1)  28 Deferred (20)  — Total (21)  28 Total $ (136) $ 150

 Income tax (benefit) expense allocated to AOCI was an immaterial amount for the year ended December 31, 2023 and $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.

 Income tax (benefit) expense differed from the amounts computed by applying the U.S. Federal income tax rate to pretax income as follows:
 Year Ended December 31,

**(Dollars in millions)** **2023** **2022**
###### Federal income taxes at statutory rate $ — $ 124 Increase (decrease) in provision for income taxes as a result of: State income taxes, net of tax benefit 7 22 US federal tax prior to Partnership Conversion 23 — Partnership Conversion impacts (167)  — Other, net 1 4 Income tax (benefit) provision $ (136) $ 150


-----

###### For periods after the Partnership Conversion, federal income taxes will not be allocated to TIH, its subsidiary partnerships, or subsidiary disregarded entities; as such, the applicable federal statutory tax rate impact for the year ended December 31, 2023 rounds to zero. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the provision for income taxes represents an effective tax rate of 25.4%.

 Significant DTAs and DTLs are presented in the following table:
 December 31,

**(Dollars in millions)** **2023** **2022**
###### DTAs Accruals and reserves $ — $ 9 Compensation and benefits 2 117 Pension — 15 Operating lease liabilities 1 32 Unearned insurance commissions 1 28 Federal and state NOLs and other carryforwards — 13 Other — 3 Total DTAs 4 217 DTLs Goodwill and other intangible assets 4 233 Operating lease assets 1 26 Deferred costs 1 72 Fixed assets — 5 Total DTLs 6 336 Deferred income taxes, net $ (2) $ (119)

 The DTAs as of December 31, 2022 included federal and state NOLs and other federal and state carryforwards that would expire, if not utilized, in varying amounts and years. As of December 31, 2022, the Company believed it was more likely than not that the Company would not realize the benefits of some deferred tax assets. As such, a small valuation allowance was recorded related to certain state tax attributes. These attributes were distributed to the Parent in the Partnership Conversion and are no longer attributes of the Company as of December 31, 2023.

 Estimated amounts related to underpayment of income taxes, including interest and penalties, are classified as a component of Income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and were not material for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.


-----

###### The following table provides a rollforward of the Company’s gross federal and state unrecognized tax benefits (“UTBs”), excluding interest and penalties:

**(Dollars in millions)** **2023** **2022**
###### Balance, January 1 $ 1 $ — Increases in UTBs due to acquisitions — 1 Reduction in a prior year position (1)  — Balance, December 31 $ — $ 1

 The amount of UTBs that would favorably affect the Company’s effective tax rate, if recognized, was $1 million as of December 31, 2022. Interest and penalties related to UTBs are recorded within Income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Upon the Partnership Conversion, the unrecognized tax benefit was transferred to the Parent and a related tax benefit associated with the transfer of $1 million was recognized. There were no interest and penalties related to UTBs as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.

 The Company recorded net income tax receivable of $4 million and $23 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

 12. Members' Equity

 The Amended and Restated TIH LLC Agreement dated April 3, 2023 ("LLC Agreement"), which initially became effective upon the Partnership Conversion in February 2023, provides for classes of units, allocation of profits and losses, distribution preferences, and other member rights. Pursuant to the LLC Agreement, TIH may issue an unlimited number of Preferred Units (refer to Note 9. Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Units for more information), Common Units, Class W Units, and Incentive Units (refer to Note 13. Equity Incentive Compensation for more information; the Incentive Units represent equity instruments issued to an economic interest holder entity which then issues Profits Interests to employees). With respect to distributions, excluding tax distributions, the Preferred Units rank senior to the Common Units, Class W Units, and Incentive Units. The Common Units rank senior to the Class W Units and Incentive Units, which are entitled to distributions only after holders of the Common Units have received distributions equal to their initial investment. Incentive Units are subject to vesting conditions and receive distributions above a threshold value that is established upon initial grant.

 One member holding Common Units and Class W Units has protections that allow the member to force the occurrence of certain liquidity events, including an IPO or Change of Control (that meet certain criteria as defined in the LLC Agreement) with respect to the interests held after minimum holding period requirements have been satisfied. In lieu of a liquidity event, TFC may elect to purchase the Common Units and Class W Units held by that member. Further, TFC may force minority interest holders to participate in certain defined transactions with respect to the Common Units and Class W Units, and the minority interest holders may be afforded participation in other defined transactions that TFC is participating in with respect to its interests in


-----

###### TIH. Additional information about the rights and privileges of the Common Units and Class W Units is provided below.

 Common Units

 In addition to the rights described above, applicable to both the Common Units and Class W Units, members that are accredited investors, holding in excess of 5% of the outstanding Common Units, are entitled to preemptive rights allowing pro rata participation in certain issuances of additional securities by the Company to TFC. Such preemptive rights also apply to secondary transactions executed by TFC. The Company concluded the preemptive rights represent a freestanding financial instrument separate from the Common Units. At the issuance date and as of December 31, 2023, the Company concluded the preemptive rights had de minimis value, as they entitle the counterparty to purchase securities based on occurrence of a contingent event at a price to be determined in the future. The Company expects such price to approximate fair value at the time of purchase.

 There were 975 million and zero Common Units issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.

 Class W Units

 In addition to the rights described above, upon consummation of an IPO, holders of Class W Units shall receive warrants to purchase shares of common stock in the public registrant equal to 3.75% of its fully diluted capitalization (the “Warrant Rights”). The Company concluded the Warrant Rights constitute a freestanding financial instrument separate from the Class W Units. At the issuance date and as of December 31, 2023, the Company concluded the Warrant Rights had de minimis value, as they entitle the counterparty to receive warrants only upon an IPO, occurrence of which is inherently uncertain.

 Class W Units held by corporate entities on behalf of others may be repurchased for cash upon an IPO at the direction of the TIH Board of Managers. Additionally, the Class W Units contain conversion rights that allow for exchange of Class W Units for Common Units with an equal value in contemplation of certain transactions other than an IPO. The Company shall provide for an equitable adjustment to the number of Class W Units outstanding in connection with a unit split, unit dividend, recapitalization or reclassification with respect to the Common Units.

 There were 38 million and zero Class W Units issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company declared and paid distributions of $110 million to members holding Common Units and Class W Units. Prior to the Partnership Conversion in February 2023 the Company declared and paid a dividend of $1.3 billion to TFC as the sole holder of TIH Inc. capital stock.


-----

###### Common Units Co-Investment

 In connection with the Partnership Conversion in February 2023, the Company provided certain employees with the opportunity to co-invest in TIH Common Units at fair value. TIH offered to fund up to 100% of the initial purchase price for such Common Units (subject to certain limitations) through a full recourse loan secured by the Common Units. Under the program, employees purchased 2 million Common Units for cash totaling $16 million and 6 million Common Units for full recourse loans totaling $60 million. The Company plans to enforce the recourse terms for the holders, which bear interest at the Applicable Federal Rate (“AFR”) in effect at issuance of the loan. Accordingly, the principal balance on the resulting loans is recorded as a deduction from Members’ Equity in the Consolidated Statements of Changes in Members' Equity and the issued Common Units are deemed not compensatory. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company received principal repayments on the full recourse loans of $10 million as well as an immaterial amount of interest payments, which were recorded as capital contributions upon receipt.

 13. Equity Incentive Compensation

 Parent Equity Incentive Plans

 Prior to establishment of the TIH Plans in April 2023, the Company did not have its own stock or stock-based compensation plans. Eligible TIH employees participated in the TFC Plans, under which they were granted RSAs, RSUs, and PSUs. These awards were issued pursuant to plans approved by TFC shareholders, as well as those assumed from acquired entities. Substantially all awards were granted in February of each year. Grants to non-executive employees primarily consist of RSUs. Typical vesting periods under the TFC Plans range from one to five years and require continued service over such period to vest in the award, except for retirement eligible employees that may have shorter service requirements.

 As of December 31, 2023, there were 34 million shares available for future grants under the TFC Plans.

 All awards granted under the TFC Plans will be settled in shares of TFC common stock. As a result, all related equity account balances remain at the TFC level, with only expenses for the awards granted to the employees providing service to the Company recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.


-----

###### RSA, RSU and PSU Activity

 The following table presents the activity related to awards of RSAs, RSUs and PSUs granted to TIH employees under the TFC Plans:
 Weighted
 Number of Average Grant
**(Units in thousands)** **Units** **Date Fair Value**

###### Nonvested at January 1, 2023 3,286 $ 50.12 Transfers In (Nonvested) 41 50.12 Granted 13 36.15 Vested (1,396) 46.08 Forfeited (137) 54.84 Nonvested at December 31, 2023 1,807 $ 52.85

 Stock-Based Compensation Expense

 The value of RSUs and PSUs is determined using the market value of TFC common stock at the date of grant, less the present value of expected dividends that will be foregone during the vesting period, and recognized as compensation expense ratably over the vesting period for awards without performance conditions. For PSUs, compensation expense is not recognized until achievement of the performance condition is probable. As of December 31, 2023, there was $13 million of unrecognized compensation expense relating to awards granted under the TFC Plans that will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.9 years.

 Stock compensation expense relating to awards granted under the TFC Plans (excluding compensation cost resulting from the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which is described below), recognized in Compensation and benefits in the Consolidated Statements of Operations was as follows:
 Year Ended December 31,

**(Dollars in millions)** **2023** **2022**
###### Stock compensation expense related to RSAs, RSUs and PSUs $ 25 $ 59 Stock compensation expense related to RSAs, RSUs and PSUs, net of tax 23 42

 For awards granted under the TFC Plans, all of the stock compensation expense recognized by the Company in 2023 and 2022 is included within corporate allocations, of which $22 million and $57 million, respectively, relate directly to Company employees, and $3 million and $2 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively, is related to allocations for TFC’s corporate and shared employee stock-based compensation expenses.

 Employee Stock Purchase Plan

 In addition to the equity incentive awards discussed above, TFC began sponsoring an ESPP in 2022. Eligible employees, including TIH employees, consist of those who have been employed for at least twelve months and work at least 20 hours per week. Under the ESPP, shares of TFC common stock may be purchased at the end of


-----

###### an offering period spanning six months at 85% of the fair market value on the purchase date. Employees may purchase shares having a value not exceeding 15% of their gross compensation during an offering period, but not more than the statutory limitation of $25,000 per year. During the year ended December 31, 2023, TIH employees purchased 528 thousand shares of TFC common stock at an average price of $27 per share, resulting in compensation cost of $3 million recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. During the year ended December 31, 2022, TIH employees purchased 225 thousand shares of TFC common stock at an average price of $37, resulting in compensation cost of $2 million recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

 TIH Equity Incentive Plan

 As described in Note 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, on April 3, 2023, TIH adopted the TIH Plans. Pursuant to the TIH Plans, TIH may issue the following types of awards to employees and other service providers:

 • Phantom Equity Units. The Phantom Equity Units, issued directly by TIH pursuant to the Truist Insurance Holdings, LLC LTIP Unit Plan (the “Phantom Equity Units Plan”), provide for cash compensation in the future based on the equity value of TIH and vest in four equal annual tranches based solely on continued service over a four-year period (or shorter for retirement-eligible employees). Cash payments shall be made on the respective vesting date for each separately vesting tranche of the award based on fair value of the underlying equity at such time.
 • Phantom Profits Interests. The Phantom Profits Interests, issued directly by TIH pursuant to the Truist Insurance Holdings, LLC Appreciation Unit Plan (the “Phantom Profits Interests Units Plan”), provide for cash compensation in the future based on appreciation in the TIH equity value above a threshold established at the time of issuance and vest on achievement of a performance condition including a Change of Control or occurrence of an IPO or Spin-Off (referred to collectively herein as “Triggering Events” or individually as a “Triggering Event”) as defined in the Phantom Profits Interests Units Plan. Continued employment through consummation of the relevant Triggering Event (and in certain cases, for a fixed period after consummation of the relevant Triggering Event) is required. Cash payments shall be made on the relevant vesting date.
 • Profits Interests. The Profits Interests, granted pursuant to the Truist Insurance Holdings, LLC Profits Interests Plan (the “Profits Interests Plan”) represent a perpetual equity interest in an entity that holds Incentive Units issued directly by TIH. Certain of the Profits Interests vest annually in equal tranches based on continued service over a four-year period (the “Time-Vested Profits Interests”), while others are subject to the same Triggering Events as the Phantom Profits Interests (the “Event-Vested Profits Interests”).

 The Company concluded the Phantom Equity Units and Phantom Profits Interests must be classified as liabilities, as they are expected to be settled in cash. As liability-classified awards, the Phantom Equity Units and Phantom Profits Interests are required to be marked to fair value each period through settlement; however, with respect to the Phantom Profits Interests, no amounts are recognized as compensation cost until the underlying Triggering Events become probable of occurring. As of December 31, 2023, the Company concluded the occurrence of a Triggering Event was not probable, and accordingly, no compensation cost on the


-----

###### Phantom Profits Interests and Event-Vested Profits Interests has been recognized.

 The fair value of the Phantom Equity Units is determined based on the value of the underlying TIH Common Units (refer to the Stock Price input below, which describes how the fair value of TIH Common Units was determined) considering a discount for lack of marketability. The fair value of the Phantom Profits Interests is determined based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model, inputs to which are described below.

 The Profits Interests represent perpetual, non-voting equity interests, and accordingly, the Company concluded equity classification is appropriate. The fair value of the Profits Interests is measured on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and is not remeasured. Inputs to the Black-Scholes option pricing model, used to value the Phantom Profits Interests and Profits Interests (Time-Vested and Event-Vested), for grants issued during the year ended December 31, 2023 were derived as follows:

 • Stock Price. Per-unit value estimated based on the Company’s aggregate equity value implied by a secondary transaction that occurred with respect to its Common Units and Class W Units in April 2023, considering movements in the market capitalization of guideline public companies from such date to the respective valuation date.
 • Expected Term. Determined based on management expectations regarding timing of a liquidity event with respect to TIH. 
 • Risk-Free Rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the United States Treasury yield curve for a term that is consistent with the expected term of the underlying awards.
 • Volatility. As the Time-Vested and Event-Vested Profits Interests are not publicly traded securities, volatility is estimated using average historical stock volatilities of several unrelated public companies that are considered comparable to TIH, adjusting for differences in capital structure, over a period equivalent to the expected term of the awards.
 • Dividend Yield. The Company does not expect to pay dividends on its Common Units; accordingly, expected dividends are equal to zero.

 During the year ended December 31, 2023, awards in the TFC Plans held by certain executives were cancelled and replaced with various awards under the TIH Plans. Refer to the sections below for additional information on the various types of awards issued during the year ended December 31, 2023.

###### Phantom Equity Units

 TIH is authorized to issue 15 million Phantom Equity Units under the Phantom Equity Units Plan, of which 8 million were available for issuance at December 31, 2023. The following table presents the activity related to awards of Phantom Equity Units for the year ended December 31, 2023:
 Weighted Average

 During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized $30 million of compensation expense related to the Phantom Equity Units. The corresponding liability is recorded within Accounts payable and accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2023, there was $41 million of unrecognized compensation expense that will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 3.2 years within Compensation and benefits in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. There was no cash paid on vested Phantom Equity Units during the year ended December 31, 2023, as the shares that vested during the year ended December 31, 2023 resulted from an acceleration event rather than under the normal vesting schedule. Pursuant to the Phantom Equity Units Plan, cash payouts only occur under the normal vesting schedule.

 The fair value of the Phantom Equity Units was determined based on the total equity value of TIH, considering a discount for lack of marketability. The Company determined the total equity value of TIH at December 31, 2023 based on the fair value implied by a secondary transaction that occurred with respect to the Common Units and Class W Units in April 2023, considering movements in the market capitalization of comparable public companies during the intervening period.

 Phantom Profits Interests

 TIH is authorized to issue 35 million Phantom Profits Interests under the Phantom Profits Interests Plan, of which 6 million were available for issuance at December 31, 2023. The following table presents the activity related to awards of Phantom Profits Interests for the year ended December 31, 2023:

###### During the year ended December 31, 2023, there was no compensation expense recognized associated with the Phantom Profits Interests, as the underlying performance conditions, which require consummation of a Triggering Event to vest, were not probable of being satisfied at the end of the period. As of December 31, 2023, there was $44 million of unrecognized compensation expense that will be recognized in Compensation and benefits in the Consolidated Statements of Operations when a triggering transaction becomes probable of occurring, considering any requisite post-transaction employment requirements and the fair value of the Phantom Profits Interests upon vesting.

 The fair value of the Phantom Profits Interests was determined using the following inputs to the Black-Scholes model as of December 31, 2023: 
 December 31, 2023 Stock price $ 10.45 Strike price $ 10.00 Term (years) 1 Risk-free rate 4.70 % Volatility 25.00 % Dividend yield — %

 Profits Interests

 TIH is authorized to issue 36 million Profits Interests under the Profits Interests Plan, of which 316 thousand were available for issuance at December 31, 2023. A portion of the Profits Interests granted during the period were issued in exchange for certain TFC awards held by TIH executives.

There was no compensation expense recognized on the Event- Vested Profits Interests, as the underlying performance conditions, which require consummation of a Triggering Event to vest, were not probable of being satisfied at the end of the period.

 As of December 31, 2023, there was $13 million of unrecognized compensation expense on the Time-Vested Profits Interests that will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 3.3 years within Compensation and benefits in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The unrecognized compensation cost

 14. Retirement Plans

 TFC sponsors defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans that are shared amongst its businesses. Participation of TIH employees in these plans is reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as though TIH participates in a multiemployer plan with TFC.

 Defined Benefit Plans

 Parent-Sponsored Plans

 TFC provides defined benefit retirement plans qualified under the Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”). In addition, supplemental retirement benefits are provided to certain key officers under supplemental defined benefit executive retirement plans, which are not qualified under the IRC. Benefits are based on years of service, age at retirement, and the employee’s compensation during the five highest consecutive years of earnings within the last ten years of employment. Assets and liabilities of such plans are retained by TFC.

 Under the multiemployer approach, net periodic pension benefit for the Company's employees has been allocated based on percent of salary for U.S. employees and active employee headcount in other jurisdictions. Net periodic pension benefit of $10 million and $13 million were included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, resulting from changes in estimates regarding TFC's expected return on plan assets.

 No contributions were made to TFC for TIH employees’ participation in defined benefit plans for the years ended December 31, 2023 or 2022.


-----

###### TIH-Sponsored Plans

 The Company provides defined benefit pension plans that are not qualified under the IRC. The benefits are available only to certain eligible producers within the Company’s Retail segment. Benefits are based on years of service and the eligible producer’s book of business prior to and following retirement.

###### Defined Contribution Plans

 TFC offers a 401(k) Savings Plan and other defined contribution plans that permit eligible employees to contribute up to 50% of cash compensation. For full-time employees who are 21 years of age or older with one year or more of service, TFC makes matching contributions of up to 6% of the employee’s compensation. In some instances, the matching contribution varies based on profitability metrics of the participant's respective line of business. TIH recognized $58 million and $50 million of expense related to TFC matching contributions for these plans on behalf of TIH employees for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Effective January 1, 2024, the Company adopted a consistent 401(k) matching policy across all business units, of up to 4% of the employee's compensation.

 15. Commitments and Contingencies

 Legal Proceedings

 The Company records losses for claims at the time and to the extent they are probable and estimable. The Company accrues anticipated costs of settlement, damages, losses for liability claims and, under certain conditions, costs of defense, based upon historical experience or to the extent specific losses are probable and estimable. Otherwise, the Company expenses these costs as incurred. If the best estimate of a probable loss is a range rather than a specific amount, the Company accrues the amount at the lower end of the range. The Company’s accruals for legal matters that were probable and estimable were not material as of December 31, 2023.

 The Company estimates reasonably possible losses, in excess of amounts accrued, of up to approximately $10 million as of December 31, 2023. This estimate does not represent the Company’s maximum loss exposure, and actual losses may vary significantly. In addition, the matters underlying this estimate will change from time to time. Estimated losses are based upon currently available information and involve considerable judgment, given that claims often include significant legal uncertainties, damages alleged by plaintiffs are often unspecified or overstated, discovery may not have started or may not be complete, and material facts may be disputed or unsubstantiated, among other factors.

 For certain matters, the Company may be unable to estimate the loss or range of loss, even if it believes that a loss is probable or reasonably possible, until developments in the case provide additional information sufficient to support such an estimate. Such matters are not accrued for and are not reflected in the estimate of reasonably possible losses.

 The following is a description of certain legal proceedings in which the Company is involved:

 Claims against McGriff Insurance Services, Inc. and Navigators Specialty Insurance Company

 In mid-September 2022, a life sciences corporate client (the “Insured”) of McGriff Insurance Services (“McGriff”) sought damages against McGriff and Navigators Specialty Insurance Company (“Navigators”, the insurance carrier) in excess of a $15 million policy limit relating to excess insurance coverage for dozens of third-party personal injury claims brought against the Insured, arising from a recalled medical device product


-----

###### that allegedly was infected with tuberculosis (the “Loss”). McGriff is a component of the Retail operating segment. The Insured alleged errors-and-omissions claims against McGriff relating to its procurement of a Navigators excess liability policy with a $15 million limit after Navigators denied coverage for the Loss. Effective November 14, 2022, Navigators and the Insured agreed to dismiss the then-pending coverage litigation involving McGriff in exchange for certain potential future payments from Navigators and McGriff to the Insured, as well as an express cap on any future, potential exposure to McGriff relating to the ongoing Loss. On December 11, 2023, the Insured filed a lawsuit in federal court in Maryland, seeking to recover alleged damages from McGriff up to the remaining cap. On January 15, 2024, McGriff filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit for failure to state a claim. The Insured filed an opposition to the motion on February 8, 2024; the court has not yet issued a ruling. The financial impact of this matter has not had a material adverse effect and is not currently expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or operating results.

 Demand to Starwind Specialty Insurance Services, LLC dba American Team Managers

 American Team Managers (“ATM”), a division of Starwind Specialty Insurance Services, LLC ("Starwind"), operates a transportation liability insurance program under a General Agency Agreement with United Specialty Insurance Company (“USIC” or the “Insurer”). Starwind is a component of the Wholesale operating segment. As the Managing General Agent of the program, ATM allegedly had underwriting and binding, as well as claims adjusting authority. On March 24, 2023, USIC sent a non-specific demand to ATM regarding mediation and efforts to resolve auto-accident litigation involving insured Dennis Alonso (“Alonso” or the “Insured”) and three injured parties (the “Plaintiffs”). At the time, the litigation at issue was pending on appeal in California state court, Abbas Souresrafil, et al. v. Dennis Alonso (the “Underlying Litigation”). On October 21, 2022, following a jury trial, the Los Angeles County Superior Court entered judgment against the Insured in the Underlying Litigation for over $37 million in compensatory damages, plus $12 million in costs and interest. As a result, USIC claims that ATM negligently handled the insurance claim and failed to settle the Underlying Litigation within the insurance policy’s $1 million limit, which exposed USIC and its reinsurer to a nearly $50 million jury verdict, as well as claims for extra-contractual liability and bad-faith from the Insured. On March 30, 2023, during mediation in which ATM did not participate, the Insurer (on behalf of Renaissance Reinsurance Ltd. a/k/a RenRe (the “Reinsurer”)), Alonso and the Plaintiffs agreed to a confidential settlement of all matters relating to the Underlying Litigation (the “Settlement”). Since then, USIC and the Reinsurer have notified ATM that they will pursue negligence and/or breach-of-contract claims against ATM for a substantial contribution to the Settlement. On February 5, 2024, the Reinsurer filed a lawsuit against Starwind in federal court in Fort Worth, TX. The claims against ATM in the complaint include: (i) breach of contract, (ii) implied contractual indemnity owed to the Reinsurer, and (iii) declaratory relief in the form of a judicial determination of the parties' respective rights under existing contracts. ATM and the Reinsurer are negotiating the terms for a potential early mediation of these claims.

 Client-Held Funds

 The Company administers escrow deposits representing funds received under real estate contracts and escrowed funds received under escrow agreements. In addition, the Company administers health savings account (“HSA”) and flexible spending account (“FSA”) funds. Collectively, such funds are referred to as “Client-held Funds”. Client-held Funds are held at third-party financial institutions and TFC. These funds are not considered assets of

 17. Related Party Transactions

 Cash Deposits

 The majority of the Company’s operating cash is held in depository accounts at Truist Bank, a wholly owned subsidiary of TFC. Deposits in these accounts are made under the same terms as other third-party Truist Bank deposit customers and may exceed FDIC insurance limits. All such cash is classified as Cash in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Investment income earned on these deposits was $64 million and an immaterial amount for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in investment income is driven by a movement of funds to interest-bearing accounts in 2023 to support the Company's standalone operations.

 Allocation of Corporate Expenses

 The operating results of TIH have historically been disclosed as part of the Insurance Holdings reportable segment within the Consolidated Financial Statements of TFC, enabling identification of directly attributable transactional information, functional departments and headcount. Directly attributable operating expenses were derived from activities relating to TIH functional departments and headcount. Certain additional costs, including compensation costs for corporate employees, have been allocated from TFC. The allocated costs for corporate functions included, but were not limited to, information technology, legal, finance and accounting, human resources, tax, treasury, shared facilities, and other shared services. Shared costs were allocated on a basis of revenue or headcount, as determined reasonable by both TFC and TIH. The amount of these allocations from TFC for each of the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $140 million and $114 million, respectively,


-----

###### recorded within Other operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

 Although it is not practicable to estimate what such costs would have been if TIH had operated as a separate entity, management believes the basis on which the expenses have been allocated to be a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided to, or the benefit received by, the Company during the periods presented.

 On April 3, 2023, the Company entered into a Services Agreement with TFC to support the Company's standalone operations. As part of the Services Agreement, TFC has agreed to provide various services, including banking and support services primarily related to information technology, real estate and facilities, finance, human resources, insurance and risk management, and legal and regulatory. The costs and expenses reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements were allocated on a systematic and rational basis based on the methodology mentioned above which may differ from the allocations specified in the Services Agreement.

 Transactions with Affiliates

 The Company enters into related party transactions with TFC and its subsidiaries. 

 Related party revenue primarily consists of revenue for employee benefit services, property and casualty policy placement services, operational services provided to TFC, and interest earned on third-party Client-held Funds held in TFC bank accounts, which the Company retains as a fee for certain employee benefit services. In addition, the Company earns investment income on cash held in depository accounts at TFC. Investment income relating to these depository accounts was $64 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Refer to the Cash Deposits section above for more information. Related party revenues recorded in Commissions and fees in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for each of the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were $29 million and $18 million, respectively. The increase in related party revenues is primarily driven by interest earned on third-party Client-held Funds, as these funds were moved to interest-bearing accounts in 2023 to support the Company's standalone operations.

 Related party expenses were $4 million and $6 million, respectively for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, and are recorded in Other operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. These costs primarily consist of service fees for TFC bank accounts and transaction costs related to acquisitions.

 Related party receivables primarily consist of amounts due to the Company for employee benefit services, property and casualty policy placement services, and operational services provided to TFC. Additionally, TFC acts as the lender (and accordingly receives principal and interest payments) on the full recourse loans that were used to fund co-investment in TIH Common Units. Amounts are remitted to TIH in the month after the payments are received. Related party receivables recorded in Commissions, fees and other receivables, net in the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $13 million and $1 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase from 2022 is primarily due to an increase in interest receivable due to the movement of funds to interest-bearing accounts in 2023 to support the Company's standalone operations.

 Related party payables primarily consist of amounts due to TFC for third-party invoices paid on behalf of the Company, office space allocations, and referral fees. Related party payables recorded in Accounts payable and accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 were $17 million and


-----

###### $9 million, respectively. The increase from 2022 is primarily due to an increase in payables related to the Services Agreement with TFC that began in April of 2023.

 Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2023, related party transactions included $1 million in fees associated with upfront issuance costs of the 2023 Revolving Credit Facility. Through December 31, 2023, no draws on the Revolving Credit Facility were made. Pursuant to the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility, the Company incurred commitment fees of $2 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, which were recorded within Interest in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Total accrued commitment fees of $2 million are recorded within Accounts payable and accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2023. There were no balances related to the Revolving Credit Facility in 2022.

 18. Subsequent Events

 The Company has evaluated all subsequent events through March 21, 2024, which is the date the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements were available to be issued. There were no subsequent events which required recognition, adjustment to or disclosure in the financial statements other than disclosed in this note, as well as certain other footnotes.

 Reorganization

 In December 2023, the Company announced plans to reorganize the internal reporting of its existing Wholesale operating segment into two divisions: Wholesale and Underwriting (the “Reorganization”). The Reorganization became effective on January 1, 2024. Each of Wholesale and Underwriting will be led by a divisional Chief Executive Officer. The Wholesale division will comprise the Company's wholesale brokerage operations that are not involved in the underwriting process with insurance carrier partners. The Underwriting division will include the remainder of operations currently part of the existing Wholesale operating segment. The Reorganization will allow the Company to better serve its clients by leveraging efficiencies created from managing similar operations together. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the Reorganization on its determination of operating segments and reporting units, which may affect future financial statement disclosures as well as goodwill impairment testing.

 Purchase Agreement

 On February 20, 2024, TFC entered into an Equity Interest Purchase Agreement to sell its remaining stake in TIH (the “Transaction”) to an investor group (the “Buyer Parties”) for a purchase price that implies an enterprise value for TIH of $15.5 billion, and is expected to result in cash proceeds to TFC of approximately $10.1 billion, reflecting certain adjustments for, and subject to further adjustments for, cash, debt and debt-like items, working capital, transaction expenses and other matters. Consummation of the Transaction is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary conditions, including, among other things, the receipt of applicable regulatory approvals and the expiration or termination of applicable waiting periods. The Transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2024. Following the close of the Transaction, TIH will operate as a standalone company.


-----

###### TFC and the Buyer Parties have agreed to enter into related agreements ancillary to the Transaction that will become effective upon the consummation of the Transaction, including (i) a customary transition services agreement, (ii) a relationship marketing agreement pursuant to which TFC and TIH will agree to provide co- marketing materials and, as may be needed, business services, to the other party’s clients, (iii) one or more agreements pursuant to which TIH will continue to serve as TFC’s broker of record for the property and casualty insurance coverage for TFC, and (iv) one or more agreements pursuant to which TIH will continue to serve as the provider of employee benefits coverage for TFC and its subsidiaries.

 The Company is required to redeem the Preferred Units at the close of the Transaction. Further, the Company will deem a change of control as probable of occurring upon the close of the Transaction and will recognize compensation expense relating to Change of Control provisions applicable to the Phantom Profits Interests and Event-Vested Profits Interests at that time.
