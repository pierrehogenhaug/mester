These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under GAAP and they include adjustments for items that may occur in future periods. However, we ----- believe these adjustments are appropriate because the amounts recognized can vary significantly from period to period, do not directly relate to the ongoing operations of our business and complicate comparisons of our internal operating results and operating results of other peer companies over time. We believe that our presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplemental information to investors and management regarding our financial condition and results of operations.

1994_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Our Company,9.1.3,Specialty Programs (15% of Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue in 2023),"We operate a variety of specialty insurance programs wherein insurance carriers have authorized us to perform certain functions on their behalf – including underwriting, pricing, and binding – for designated risks. Our authority to perform these functions is usually subject to underwriting guidelines, policy limits and pricing parameters that are developed jointly with our carrier partners and are specific to each program. When our subsidiaries and programs serve as an MGA, we generally act as an intermediary between retail and wholesale brokers who request insurance coverages and carriers who provide balance sheet capacity. If we are able to bind coverages, we issue policies on behalf of the insurance carriers we represent. Because we operate on behalf of the insurance carriers, our programs do not take underwriting risk for the policies we bind. Our Specialty Programs business is one of the largest MGA platforms in the United States by 2022 premium volume with $5.4 billion of premiums written in 2023 spread across more than 40 programs. We have a ----- highly diversified business mix comprised of 46% property, 10% construction, 10% transportation, 9% reinsurance, 9% professional lines, 6% marine and energy, 4% real estate and 6% other lines for 2023 premiums.

AmRisc is one of the largest property catastrophe MGAs in the United States with $2.6 billion of total premiums written during 2023. Of these premiums, approximately $2.3 billion are allocated to commercial lines.

1994_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Industry,9.2.1,P&C Insurance Brokerage Market,"P&C insurance in the United States is sold by two types of insurance carriers: those that are state licensed (“admitted”) and those that operate beyond state licensing (“non-admitted”). Admitted carriers typically sell standard insurance products for which insurance rates and risk coverages are relatively uniform and must comply with applicable laws and, in certain states, regulatory approval. Non-admitted carriers typically engage in the excess and surplus (“E&S”) lines market, taking on relatively specialized and complex risks that do not fit the underwriting criteria of standard insurance products. Through the scope of our business activities as an insurance broker, we provide products and services to both the admitted and non-admitted insurance markets. Insurance brokers act as intermediaries between insureds and insurance carriers. Retail producers place P&C insurance coverages on behalf of businesses, public institutions and individual clients, negotiating with carriers for competitive rates and policy terms. Retail producers are typically compensated through commissions paid by carriers on the premium that is placed; however, they can also be paid on a fee basis for their insurance placement and other risk consultation services. Wholesale insurance brokers act as intermediaries between insurance carriers and retail producers by assisting retail producers in placing business that is outside of their core expertise or ability to place directly. Wholesale insurance brokers often provide retail insurance brokers with specialty and E&S insurance products. Wholesale brokers are typically compensated by commissions paid by the insurance carrier, although they can also receive fees in addition to commissions for placing certain insurance policies. In some cases, brokers can act as an MGA for insurance carriers. An MGA generally has authority to bind coverage on behalf of an insurance carrier for a specific type of risk, subject to agreed-upon guidelines and limits. An MGA generally does not assume underwriting risk for the products that it distributes. Historically, despite economic ebbs and flows, the P&C insurance sector has demonstrated resilient and stable growth. Total U.S. P&C direct written premiums increased each year between 1996 and 2023 (except during the 2008 global financial crisis), resulting in a 4.4% CAGR from 1996 to 2022. P&C premium growth tends to be less volatile than changes in insurance rates, which can fluctuate during soft and hard markets. During periods of declining premium rates (known as soft markets), insureds tend to increase limits on coverages, purchase new coverages and reduce deductibles. Conversely, during periods of increasing premium rates (known as hard markets), insureds typically lower coverages and maintain higher deductibles. Combined with overall economic growth, these dynamics have led to stable growth in P&C premiums over time. The P&C insurance brokerage market has seen a large amount of consolidation activity over the last decade as the industry shifts from a high degree of fragmentation to one where scaled, national platforms command a growing share of the market. However, despite substantial consolidation, more than 40,000 independent brokerage agencies were operating in the United States in 2022, an increase from 36,000 in 2020. We believe that this provides a stable basis for ongoing M&A activity in the sector.",N/A,as_expected,2024,298
1994_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Industry,9.2.2,Employee Benefits Market,"Employee benefits brokers and consultants primarily cater to companies and their employees by offering a suite of health-related insurance products, including medical, life and disability coverages, as well as overseeing retirement and asset management programs. These experts act both as intermediaries and strategic planners, offering guidance on structuring benefit plans. As all-in-one solution providers, they enable middle-market businesses to outsource the complexities of benefits planning, oversight and administration, thus allowing these businesses to bypass the need for extensive internal infrastructure or significant investments in technology. Demand for employee benefits offerings is largely driven by overall employment levels. The primary driver of pricing for these products and services is healthcare spending. The design and execution of employee benefit strategies have become increasingly nuanced, especially against the backdrop of ongoing healthcare inflation and increased regulatory complexity. This evolving landscape underscores the growing relevance of adept benefits brokers with strong service offerings and expertise. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,298
1994_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Industry,9.2.3,,"We operate our business within the U.S. insurance brokerage industry. We primarily compete for business on the basis of reputation, relationships, client service, expertise, product offerings, and the ability to tailor our products and risk management services to meet the needs of clients.

Gallagher & Co. and Brown & Brown, Inc.), large privately held brokerage businesses and other small locally-owned agencies. Through our Wholesale brokerage business, we compete with a number of other wholesale brokerage firms such as Ryan Specialty Holdings, Inc. (publicly traded), Amwins Group, Inc.

1994_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Strengths,9.3.1,Scaled Platform with Market Leading Positions Across the Insurance Distribution Chain,"We are the fifth largest insurance broker in the United States by 2022 brokerage revenue with over $50 billion in premium volume and approximately $3.5 billion of revenue in 2023. We believe that our reputation, built through more than 100 years of operating history, as well as our size and scale grant us a distinct advantage in the marketplace, enabling us to better assist our clients while deepening our engagement with insurance carriers. As we continue to pursue our goals of increasing both our market share with clients and the depth of our relationships with insurance carriers, we expect to further enhance our value proposition by providing heightened access to both constituents. We believe we provide such enhanced access through a network of more than 2,000 producers and over 450 underwriters based in over 200 locations across the United States as of December 31, 2023. We also maintain over 40,000 wholesale agent relationships as of December 31, 2023. We have robust capabilities across the insurance distribution chain, which we believe make us well positioned to better serve our clients while capturing a greater proportion of commission revenues. Our key brands include McGriff Insurance (a top 15 retail broker by 2022 brokerage revenue), CRC (a top 3 P&C wholesale broker by 2022 premium volume), AmRisc (a leading property catastrophe MGA), Starwind (a leading program manager), Crump (a leading life wholesaler), BenefitMall (a leading employee benefits wholesaler) and Kensington Vanguard (an independent commercial title agency).

1994_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Strengths,9.3.2,Highly Diversified Business Model,"Our revenue base is highly diversified across distribution channels, lines of business, geographies, clients, end markets, producers and carriers, among other factors. Our diversification ensures limited reliance on any particular product, distribution channel, customer, or market, reducing our exposure to any adverse industry developments and macroeconomic factors and thereby mitigating volatility in our overall financial performance. In addition, the breadth of our offerings provides us with various avenues through which we can identify gaps in the market and develop specialized products to capture unmet demand. 1) P&C represents CRC, Specialty Programs and McGriff Insurance (excluding employee benefits). Employee benefits represents McGriff Insurance’s employee benefits business and BenefitMall. Life represents Crump. Title represents Kensington Vanguard. 2) Top 30 rankings exclude Lloyd’s market. ----- Given the diversification of our business model, we are well positioned to channel premiums across several distribution channels in situations that would benefit our clients. Ultimately, this enables us to better serve our clients by providing enhanced coverage and placement for their risks while also allowing us to capture a greater proportion of economics from the value chain. In 2023, McGriff Insurance placed approximately $1 billion of premiums into CRC, 8% of CRC’s total premium. In the same year, McGriff Insurance placed approximately $54 million of premiums into Starwind, 2% of Starwind’s total premium. Similarly, CRC placed approximately $580 million of premiums with AmRisc, 23% of Amrisc’s total premium, and approximately $280 million of premiums with Starwind, 9% of Starwind’s total premium.",N/A,as_expected,2024,298
1994_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Strengths,9.3.3,Long-Term Track Record of Growth with Continued Secular Tailwinds,"We have a long-term track record of consistent growth. Over the last 19 years, we have demonstrated a robust growth trajectory with a 9.5% total revenue CAGR and 4.2% average annual organic growth. We have a demonstrated track record of growing organically across P&C and economic market cycles. Our average organic revenue growth was 8%, 8% and 5% over the last 3, 5 and 10 years, respectively. We benefit from the non-discretionary nature of insurance coverage and employee benefits, which we believe creates relatively stable, consistent demand for our offerings across P&C and economic market cycles. We also believe we benefit from distinct advantages in the marketplace driven by our longstanding reputation, scale, depth of relationships, client service, expertise, and product offerings. ----- 1) Based on P&C direct premiums written. 2) Based on annual average commercial P&C rate changes. We believe that our organic revenue growth compares favorably to large, publicly traded insurance brokers with whom we compete (such as Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc., Aon plc, Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company, Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. and Brown & Brown, Inc.). Since 2018, we have generated higher annual organic revenue growth compared to the median of large, publicly traded peer brokerage segments. Our average annual organic revenue growth between 2018 and 2023 was 7.3%, including our Title and Wellington businesses, and 7.8% excluding these businesses. This compares favorably to a public peer composite average of 6.8%. We believe that our outperformance is driven by our diversified business model and strong growth across our wholesale P&C and MGA businesses. 1) Represents TIH organic revenue growth excluding the Title and Wellington businesses. 2) Represents the median organic revenue growth for the brokerage segments of Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc., Aon plc, Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company, Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. and Brown & Brown, Inc. per public filings. We believe that a combination of secular tailwinds, in addition to our identified growth initiatives, will help to sustain our strong organic growth trajectory. _Market Share Growth for E&S Lines and MGAs. Insurance risks are becoming increasingly complex and_ specialized given the impacts of globalization and technological change, among other factors. As a result, E&S lines are becoming more prevalent in the United States, resulting in higher market share. In 2022, $98 billion of direct premiums written were in E&S lines, representing 11% of P&C premiums in the United States. This is nearly double the $45 billion of E&S direct written premiums in 2017, which comprised 7% of P&C premiums at the time. Similarly, utilization of MGAs is increasing as a means of efficiently underwriting and placing complex risks. Direct written premiums channeled through MGAs in the United States grew from $43 billion in 2017 to $86 billion in 2022, reflecting a growth in market share from 7% to 10% of total P&C premiums. We believe these trends have generated a sustained tailwind for our organic growth given the weighting of our product mix and distribution channels. _P&C Pricing Environment. The P&C sector is currently characterized by a hard market with a general_ upward trend in pricing. The average premium rate change for commercial P&C products was 10.6% in 2020, 9.0% in 2021, 7.5% in 2022 and 8.4% in 2023. We believe uplifts in pricing for the coverages we sell generate favorable impacts on our organic growth. _Broker Commission Rates. Broker commission rates have gradually increased over time and have_ demonstrated resilience amid the current hard market environment, reflecting the strong value proposition delivered ----- by brokerage firms to clients and carriers. Direct commission rates for commercial P&C lines were 13.3% in 2019, 13.2% in 2020, 13.4% in 2021 and 13.6% in 2022, which compared favorably to 12.1% in 2011. We believe higher brokerage commission rates create a tailwind for our organic growth. In addition to strong organic growth, our growth has also been propelled historically by acquiring and developing key capabilities that have enhanced the scale of our platform and the depth and breadth of our offerings.",N/A,as_expected,2024,298

Key components of our organic growth strategy include: (1) enhanced cross-sell to existing clients across all of our operations, (2) development of new programs and products given opportunities in the marketplace, and (3) producer recruitment and retention. We have a long and successful track record of attracting and retaining producer talent. Since January 2019, we have hired over 360 producers at McGriff Insurance and over 270 brokers at CRC. The McGriff Insurance producer hires generated $103 million of revenue in 2023, representing approximately 9% of McGriff Insurance’s total commissions and fees during 2023. The CRC broker hires generated $128 million of revenue in 2023, representing 10.7% of CRC’s total commissions and fees during 2023. Producer recruiting activity remained strong in 2023 following Stone Point’s minority investment and implementation of the new TIH equity incentive plan.

Of this amount, $61 million of reductions have been actioned in 2023 (or are scheduled to be actioned in the first quarter of 2024) and $7 million have been realized in 2023. Key cost saving categories include: (1) targeted reductions in force of duplicative leadership and unprofitable producers across all business units, (2) rationalization of real estate footprint and consolidation of overlapping offices, (3) tightened oversight of travel and entertainment spend, and (4) third party vendor contract optimization. Viewing the $96 million of expected expense reductions holistically, 53% relates to organizational restructuring, 21% relates to additional outsourcing, 3% relates to real estate rationalization and 23% relates to other initiatives. Additionally, we have identified an incremental $28 million of potential expense reductions, which we expect to action in 2024, including $20 million in possible savings from outsourcing or offshoring non-client facing functions, $3 million of expected additional real estate rationalization savings and approximately $5 million of potential information technology savings.

See “Capitalization.” (6) Represents estimated cash and cash equivalents at the closing of the Acquisition. (7) Reflects estimates for the Senior Credit Facilities and the notes offered hereby using a weighted average blended estimate rate. Borrowings under the Senior Credit Facilities bear interest at variable rates and are subject to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, the debt service obligations on the loans would increase and cash required for servicing indebtedness would increase. Assuming the Revolving Credit Facility is fully drawn, each 0.125% change in assumed blended interest rates would result in an approximately $8.0 million change in annual interest expense on indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facilities. (8) The as adjusted ratio of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA to cash interest expense is determined by dividing Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA by as adjusted cash interest expense. (9) The as adjusted ratio of senior first lien secured debt to Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA is determined by dividing as adjusted senior first lien secured debt by Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA.

Also, if general economic conditions are poor, some of our customers may cease operations completely or be acquired by other companies, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. If these customers are affected by poor economic conditions, but yet remain in existence, they may face liquidity problems or other financial difficulties that could result in delays or defaults in payments owed to us, which could have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, decreased underwriting capacity for insurance and reinsurance may create difficulty for us to place business, which may adversely impact our ability to earn revenue.

The continued threat of terrorism and other events or disasters may cause significant volatility in global financial markets, and a natural or man-made disaster could trigger energy shortages, public health issues, or an economic downturn or instability in the areas directly or indirectly affected by the disaster. These consequences could, among other things, result in a decline in business and increased claims from those areas. They could also result in reduced underwriting capacity, making it more difficult for our professionals to place business. Disasters also could disrupt public and private infrastructure, including communications and financial services, which could disrupt our normal business operations and negatively impact the abilities of our counterparties to pay for our services on time or at all. If access to underwriting markets for certain lines of coverage becomes unavailable or difficult due to the impact of climate change on the claims environment, this may have a negative impact on our clients’ access to coverage, which could in turn reduce our ability to place certain lines of coverage and negatively impact our business. A natural or man-made disaster also could disrupt the operations of our counterparties or result in increased prices for the products and services they provide to us. In addition, a disaster could adversely affect the value of the assets in our investment portfolio and reduce our insurer capacity.

We believe that our most likely source of competition will be other brokerages that pursue an acquisition or consolidation strategy similar to ours, as well as other large regional brokerages. Over the last several decades, large insurance brokerages, often publicly-traded companies with access to the capital markets, have been acquiring and consolidating small- to medium-sized independent brokerages to strengthen their competitive position and to increase market share and recently, due to increased consolidation in our industry, the value of acquisition targets has increased. Other competitive concerns may include the availability of products and services, the market price and the ability of some of our customers to self-insure and the entrance of technology companies into the insurance intermediary business. This exposes us to a risk of being less competitive when trying to acquiring companies and increases the risk that we may overpay for future acquisitions. If we fail to execute our acquisition strategy, our revenue growth and ability to remain competitive in our industry are likely to suffer. In circumstances where we are able to make acquisitions, we may need to incur contingent earn-out obligations for these acquisitions. In addition, there has been an increase in alternative insurance markets, such as captives, risk retention groups and non-insurance capital markets. While we collaborate and compete in some of these segments, we cannot be certain that such alternative markets will provide the same level of insurance coverage or profitability as traditional insurance markets.",N/A,as_expected,2024,298

We do not control the factors that cause these variations. Specifically, customers’ demand for insurance products can influence the timing of renewals, new business and lost business (which includes policies that are not renewed), and cancellations. In addition, we rely on insurance companies for the payment of contingent commissions. Because these payments are processed internally by these insurance companies, we may not receive a payment that is otherwise expected from a particular insurance company in a particular quarter or year until after the end of that period, which can adversely affect our ability to forecast these revenues and therefore budget for significant future expenditures. Quarterly and annual fluctuations in revenues based on increases and decreases associated with the timing of policy renewals may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2024,298
1994_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.6,"Our commissions depend on premium rates charged by insurance carriers, which we do not control and which historically have varied and are difficult to predict. Any declines in premiums may adversely impact our operating results.","We are engaged in insurance agency and brokerage activities and derive revenue principally from commissions paid by insurance carriers. Commissions accounted for approximately 79% of our total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2023. Commissions are generally paid on the basis of a percentage of premiums paid ----- by customers for insurance products. We have no control over the insurance premium rates on which these commissions are calculated. The amount of such commissions is therefore highly dependent on the premium rates charged by insurance carriers. Premium rates may vary widely and are determined by insurance carriers based on specific market conditions, applicable law and, in certain states, regulatory approval. Insurance premium pricing within the traditional property and casualty insurance industry has historically been cyclical, based on the relative underwriting capacity of the insurance industry and economic conditions. We use the terms “soft market” and “hard market” to describe the business cycles experienced by the industry. A soft market is an insurance market characterized by a period of declining premium rates, which can negatively affect commissions earned by insurance brokers. A hard market is an insurance market characterized by a period of rising premium rates, which, absent other changes, can positively affect commissions earned by insurance brokers. External events, such as terrorist attacks and natural disasters, can also have significant impacts on the insurance market. Because we cannot determine the timing and extent of premium pricing changes, we cannot accurately forecast our commission income, including whether it will significantly decline. If premiums decline or commission rates are reduced, our revenue, results of operations and cash flow could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, an increase in the number of insolvencies associated with an economic downturn, especially insolvencies in the insurance industry, could adversely affect our brokerage business through the loss of clients or by hampering our ability to place insurance business. There have also been and may continue to be various trends in the insurance industry toward alternative insurance markets including, among other things, greater levels of self-insurance, captive insurance (i.e., arrangements where the policyholder owns the insurance company), rent-a-captive or segregated cell arrangements, risk retention groups and non-insurance capital markets-based solutions to traditional insurance. While we may be able to participate in certain of these activities on behalf of our customers and obtain fee revenue for such services, there can be no assurance that we will realize revenues and profitability as favorable as those realized from our traditional brokerage activities.",N/A,as_expected,2024,298
1994_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.7,"Contingent and supplemental revenues we receive from insurance or reinsurance carriers are less predictable than standard commission revenues, and any decrease in the amount of these forms of revenue could adversely affect our results of operations.","A meaningful portion of our revenues consists of contingent and supplemental revenues from insurance or reinsurance carriers. Contingent revenues are paid after the insurance contract period, generally in the first or second quarter, based on the growth and/or profitability of business we placed with insurance or reinsurance carriers during the prior year. On the other hand, supplemental revenues are paid up front, on an annual or quarterly basis, generally based on our historical premium volumes with insurance or reinsurance carriers and additional capabilities or services we bring to the engagement. While insurance or reinsurance carriers generally maintain supplemental revenues in the current year at a pre-determined rate, that rate can change in future years as described above. In addition there are revenues subject to sliding scale commissions based on overall underwriting performance. This is evaluated quarterly based on third-party actuarial analysis. If, due to the current economic environment or for any other reason, we are unable to meet insurance or reinsurance carriers’ particular profitability, volume or growth thresholds, as the case may be, or such companies increase their estimate of loss reserves (over which we have no control), actual contingent revenues or supplemental revenues could be less than anticipated, which could adversely affect our results of operations.

Capacity could also be reduced by insurance companies failing or withdrawing from writing certain coverages that we offer to our clients. We have no control over these matters. To the extent that ----- reinsurance becomes less widely available or significantly more expensive, we may not be able to procure the amount or types of coverage that our clients desire and the coverage we are able to procure for our clients may be too expensive or more limited than is acceptable.",N/A,as_expected,2024,298

We may be unsuccessful in growing revenues organically, and our failure to do so may negatively impact our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.","We have experienced significant organic revenue growth in recent periods. As a means to grow our earnings in future periods, we intend to focus on generating organic growth in revenues and creating efficiencies in our operations. Our business plan contemplates that we will grow revenue organically over the long term through all insurance industry cycles and economic market cycles, primarily by continuing our specialty focus and team-based selling approach and by pursuing alternative distribution strategies with co-brokers. We may not be able to sustain organic revenue growth consistent with recent history, or at all. If we fail to succeed in our organic growth strategy, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively affected. We believe our revenue growth depends on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, our ability to: - deliver on customer expectations and provide a positive customer experience; - successfully execute large-scale, critical programs and projects in a timely and cost-effective manner; - identify and successfully enter and market our services in new geographic markets and market segments; - recruit and retain qualified personnel; - coordinate efforts across various geographic markets and market segments; - maintain and grow relationships with our existing customers and expand our customer base; - offer new products and services; - form strategic alliances and partnerships; - secure key partner and vendor relationships; and - access sufficient capital. We may not successfully accomplish any of these objectives and ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty may impact our ability to successfully accomplish any of the above. As a result, it is difficult for us to forecast our future results of operations. Our historical growth rate should not be considered indicative of our future performance and may decline in the future. In future periods, our revenue could grow more slowly than in recent periods or decline for any number of reasons (including those outlined above), which could negatively affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2024,298

The success of our acquisition strategy is dependent upon our ability to identify appropriate acquisition targets, negotiate transactions on favorable terms, complete transactions, have adequate access to financing and the ability to finance acquisitions on acceptable terms, and successfully integrate them into our existing businesses. We may not be successful in identifying appropriate acquisition and disposition candidates or consummating acquisitions on terms acceptable or favorable to us. We also face additional risks related to acquisitions, including the ability to negotiate transactions on favorable terms, the ability to secure regulatory approval of transactions where required, the ability to successfully integrate them into our existing businesses and culture, and the potential that any acquired business could significantly underperform relative to our expectations. If we are unable to identify and successfully make, integrate and manage acquisitions, our business could be materially adversely affected. Additionally, if we were to expand to or acquire businesses outside of the United States, we may be subject to additional risks related to foreign operations, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. If acquisitions are made, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions, including, but not limited to, revenue growth, operational efficiencies, or expected synergies. Acquisitions involve special risks, including the potential assumption of unanticipated liabilities and contingencies and difficulties in integrating acquired businesses, and acquired businesses may not achieve the levels of revenue, profit, or productivity we anticipate or otherwise perform as we expect. In addition, if the operating performance of an acquired business deteriorates significantly, we may need to write down the value of the goodwill and other acquisition-related intangible assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. Many of the businesses and assets that we have acquired or may acquire have unaudited historical financial statements or records that have been, or will be, prepared by the management of such companies and have not been, or will not be, independently reviewed or audited. We cannot be certain that the financial statements or records of companies or assets we have acquired or may acquire would not, or will not, be materially different if such statements were independently reviewed or audited. If such statements were to be materially different, the tangible and intangible assets we acquire may be more susceptible to impairment charges, which could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, many of the businesses that we acquire and develop will likely have smaller scales of operations prior to the implementation of our growth strategy. If we are not able to manage the growing complexity of these businesses, including improving, refining, or revising our systems and operational practices, enlarging the scale and scope of the businesses, and integrating the new business into our culture and operations, our business may be adversely affected. The process of integrating an acquired business may subject us to a number of risks, including, without limitation, an inability to retain the management, key personnel and other colleagues of the acquired business; an inability to establish uniform standards, controls, systems, procedures and policies or to achieve anticipated savings; and exposure to legal claims or regulatory censure for activities of the acquired business prior to acquisition. With respect to any such acquisition transactions, we face the risk related to the potential impacts of the transaction and integration on relationships, including with colleagues, correspondents, suppliers, clients and ----- competitors, as well as the risk related to contingent liabilities (including litigation) potentially creating material liabilities for the Company. The following risks, in addition to those described above, may also adversely affect our ability to successfully implement and integrate these acquisitions: material changes in U.S. jurisdiction regulation (including those related to the healthcare system and Medicare and insurance brokerage, pension advisory, and investment services); changes in general economic, business and political conditions in relevant markets, including changes in the financial markets; significant competition in the marketplace; and compliance with extensive and evolving government regulations in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. If acquisitions or entry into businesses, products or services are not successfully integrated and the intended benefits of the acquisitions or business developments are not achieved, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected, as well as our professional reputation. From time to time, either through acquisitions or internal development, we enter new distribution channels or lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business. These new distribution channels, lines of business, or new products and services present additional risks, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed. Such risks include the investment of significant time and resources to recruit, hire, and retain personnel and develop the products, the risks involved with the management of the integration process and development of new processes and systems to accommodate complex programs, and the risk of financial guarantees and additional liabilities associated with these efforts. Failure to manage these risks arising from acquisitions or development of new businesses could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2024,298

In many cases, insurance carriers also have the ability to amend the terms of our agreements unilaterally on short notice. Insurance carriers may be unwilling to allow us to sell their existing or new insurance products or may amend our agreements with them, for a variety of reasons, including for competitive or regulatory reasons or because of a reluctance to distribute their products through our platform. Insurance carriers may decide to rely on their own internal distribution channels, choose to exclude us from their most profitable or popular products, or decide not to distribute insurance products in individual markets in certain geographies or altogether. The termination or amendment of our relationship with an insurance carrier could reduce the variety of insurance products we offer or our ability to place coverage for certain risks for which we do not have alternative markets. We also could lose a source of, or be paid reduced commissions for, future sales and could lose renewal commissions for past sales. Our business could also be harmed if we fail to develop new insurance carrier relationships. Similarly, as it relates to wholesale brokerage, retail agencies and other trading partners could develop their own wholesale distribution channels or choose to work with wholesale distributors other than us. This could reduce the number of submissions we receive which could result in reduced commissions. Historically, wholesale brokers and other wholesale distributors have been involved in a very high percentage of risks placed in the excess and surplus market. In addition to the potential for retailers developing their own wholesale distribution channels or choosing to work with wholesale distributors other than us, retail brokers often might prefer to place business directly with insurance carriers, without the involvement of a wholesaler. There is a risk to our business that insurance carriers will accommodate the retail broker’s preference to place business directly with the excess and surplus insurer as opposed to through a wholesale broker or other wholesale distributor. In the future, we may have a reduced number of insurance carriers or retail agencies, in the case of wholesale brokerage, with which we trade or derive a greater portion of our commissions and fees from a more ----- concentrated number of insurance carriers, retailers or other trading partners as our business and the insurance industry evolve. Should our dependence on a smaller number of insurance retailers or other trading partners increase, whether as a result of the termination of relationships, consolidation or otherwise, we may become more vulnerable to adverse changes in our relationships with these counterparties, particularly in states where we offer insurance products from a relatively small number of insurance carriers or where a small number of insurance companies or retailers dominate a geographic area, lines of business or market segment. The termination or consolidation of insurance retailers could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. We depend, to a large extent, on our relationships with all of our trading partners and our reputation for high-quality advice and solutions. If a trading partner is not satisfied with our services, it could cause us to incur additional costs and impair profitability. Many of our clients are businesses that band together in industry groups or trade associations and actively share information among themselves about the quality of service they receive from their vendors. Accordingly, poor service to one client may negatively impact our relationships with multiple other clients or potential clients.

Additionally, several of our subsidiaries hold MGA licenses. We generated 25% of our consolidated total net commissions and fees for the year ended December 31, 2023 from our MGA programs. Our MGA programs are governed by contracts between us and the insurance carriers. These contracts establish, among other things, the underwriting and pricing guidelines for the program, the scope of our authority and our commission rates for policies that we underwrite under the program. These contracts typically can be terminated by the insurance carrier with very little advance notice. Moreover, upon expiration of the contract term, insurance carriers may request changes in the terms of the program, including the amount of commissions we receive, which could reduce our revenues from the program. The termination of any of our MGA programs, or a change in the terms of any of these programs, could harm our business and operating results. We cannot be assured that lost insurance capacity can be replaced or that other MGA programs will not be terminated or modified in the future.

These third parties include correspondents, agents and other brokerage and intermediaries, insurance markets, data providers, plan trustees, payroll service providers, software and system vendors, health plan providers, and providers of human resource functions such as recruiters and trainers, among others. As we do not fully control the actions of these third parties, we are subject to the risk that their decisions may adversely impact us and replacing these service providers could create significant delay and expense. A failure by the third parties to comply with service level agreement or regulatory or legal requirements, in a high quality and timely manner, particularly during periods of our peak demand for their services, could result in economic and reputational harm to us. In addition, these third parties face their own technology, operating, business and economic risks, and any significant failures by them, including the improper use or disclosure of our confidential client, employee, or company information, could cause harm to our reputation. An interruption in or the cessation of service by any service provider as a result of systems failures, capacity constraints, financial difficulties or for any other reason could disrupt our operations, impact our ability to offer certain products and services, and result in contractual or regulatory penalties, liability claims from clients and/or employees, damage to our reputation and harm to our business. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,298

Further, the failure of E&O insurance or reinsurance carriers could make the E&O insurance we rely upon cost prohibitive or unavailable. Any of these developments could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if insurance or reinsurance carriers merge, fail, or withdraw from offering certain lines of coverage, for example, because of large payouts related to climate or weather events or other emerging risk areas, overall risk-taking capital capacity could be negatively affected, which could reduce our ability to place certain lines of coverage, and, as a result, reduce our revenues and profitability.",N/A,as_expected,2024,298

While we have not experienced material difficulties with the collection of our outstanding receivables to date, others in our industry have experienced collection issues from time to time, and we could experience similar collection problems in the future. Timely collection of client balances also depends on our ability to complete our contractual commitments and bill and collect our contracted revenues. If we are unable to meet our contractual requirements, we might experience delays in collection of, or be unable to collect, our client balances, and if this occurs, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.

1994_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.3,Legal and Regulatory Risks,13.3.1,"We are subject to extensive and evolving government regulation and supervision, which could increase the cost of doing business, limit our ability to make investments and generate revenue, and lead to costly examinations and/or enforcement actions.","We are subject to supervision, regulation, and examination by regulators, including state departments of insurance, the SEC and various other federal, state and self-regulatory agencies. Compliance with the requirements ----- of these laws and regulations, among others, may be costly and could adversely affect our business. Certain aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act and other legislative, regulatory and technological changes affect the Company’s operations. The scope of regulation and the form of supervision may vary from state to state and insurance laws are often complex and generally grant broad discretion to supervisory authorities in adopting regulations and supervising regulated activities. This supervision generally includes the licensing of insurance brokers and agents and the regulation of the handling of client funds held in a fiduciary capacity. Changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies or their interpretation or implementation and the continued heightening of regulatory requirements could affect the Company in substantial and unpredictable ways. State insurance regulators also possess broad powers to take supervisory actions as they deem appropriate. These supervisory actions may result in higher compliance expenses and limitations on the Company’s activities that could have a material adverse effect on operations or profitability. Our continuing ability to provide insurance products and related employee benefits services in the states in which we currently operate is dependent upon our compliance with the regulations promulgated from time to time by the regulatory authorities in each of these states and our producers’ ability to attain and maintain licenses, which generally may be granted, renewed or revoked at the discretion of state authorities for various reasons, including the violation of regulations. In some instances, where there is uncertainty as to applicability, we follow practices based on our interpretations of regulations or practices that we believe generally to be followed by the industry. These practices may turn out to be different from the interpretations of regulatory authorities. If we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, state insurance regulators could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities in their state or could otherwise penalize us. This could adversely affect our ability to operate our business. In all jurisdictions, the applicable laws and regulations are subject to amendment or interpretation by regulatory authorities. State insurance regulators and legislatures continually re-examine existing laws and regulations, some of which affect us, including those relating to the licensing of insurance brokers and agents, premium rates, the regulation of unfair trade and claims practices, the regulation of underwriting practices, the regulation of the handling and investment of policyholder and insurance carrier funds held in a fiduciary capacity and regulation of business practices generally, including our compensation arrangements with insurers and clients. These examinations may result in the enactment of insurance-related laws and regulations, or the issuance of interpretations of existing laws and regulations, that adversely affect our business. More restrictive laws, rules or regulations may be adopted in the future that could make compliance more difficult and/or expensive. In addition, the method by which insurance intermediaries are compensated has received substantial scrutiny from regulators in the past because of the potential for conflicts of interest. The potential for conflicts of interest arises when an intermediary is compensated by two parties in connection with the same or similar transactions. The vast majority of the compensation that we receive is in the form of commissions and fees. The amount of compensation that we receive from insurance companies for contingent commissions, separate from commissions and fees, has increased in the last several years. Future changes in the regulatory environment may impact our ability to collect these revenue streams. In addition, these revenues present potential regulatory, litigation and reputational risks that may arise from alleged conflicts of interest or allegations under antitrust, competition and other laws. Adverse regulatory, legal or other developments regarding these revenues could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition, expose us to negative publicity and reputational damage and harm our client, insurer or other relationships. We also rely upon third parties who may expose the Company to compliance and legal risk. New or existing legal requirements also could heighten the reputational impact of perceived misuses of customer data by the Company and third parties. We also are subject to existing and changing privacy and data security laws, regulations, and contractual obligations. Our own actual or perceived failure, or the failure of third-party vendors with whom we do business, to comply with these obligations could harm our business. The California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”), which went into effect on January 1, 2020 and was expanded by the California Privacy Rights Act that went into effect on January 1, 2023, is an example of the increasing costs of privacy compliance our business faces and the potential for increased liability in the event of noncompliance or a data breach. Under the CCPA, California residents have a number of new rights that are enforceable by the California Attorney General (for example, rights to access and deletion of personal information), as well as a private right of action in the event of a data breach. The CCPA ----- provides an exemption for personal information collected, processed, sold or disclosed pursuant to the GrammLeach-Bliley Act (the “GLBA”), the main federal privacy law governing financial institutions. Given this exception, we are partially exempt from many of the requirements of the CCPA. Other states, including Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Indiana, Iowa, Montana, New Jersey, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and Virginia, have also passed privacy laws similar to the CCPA/CPRA, and numerous additional states are considering enacting privacy laws. Any or all of these laws could further increase the costs and complexity of compliance. The impact of these laws on us and others in our industry is unclear as they continue to develop and are subject to revisions and evolving judicial interpretation.",N/A,as_expected,2024,298

The risks associated with these matters often can be difficult to assess or quantify and the existence and magnitude of potential claims often remain unknown for substantial periods of time. While we have insurance coverage for some of these potential claims, others may not be covered by insurance, insurers may dispute coverage or any ultimate liabilities may exceed our coverage. We could be subject to actions and claims relating to the sale, solicitation and negotiation of insurance (including underlying securities in variable insurance and annuity products). Such actions and claims can further relate to issues such as the suitability of such products and services, as well as denials of coverage or appropriately applying funds that we hold for our customers on a fiduciary basis. Actions and claims can result in the rescission of such sales; consequently, we can potentially seek to recoup commissions paid to us, which could lead to legal action against us. The outcome of such actions cannot be predicted and such claims or actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to laws and regulations, as well as regulatory investigations. The insurance, investment advisory, and broker-dealer industry has been subject to a significant level of scrutiny by various regulatory bodies, including state Attorneys General offices, state departments of insurance, the SEC and other federal, state and selfregulatory agencies concerning certain practices within each of these specific industries. In particular, with respect to insurance, these practices include, without limitation, the receipt of contingent commissions by insurance brokers and agents from insurance companies and the extent to which such compensation has been disclosed, the collection of agency fees, which we define as fees, separate from commissions, charged directly to clients for efforts performed in the issuance of new insurance policies, bid rigging and related matters. From time to time, our subsidiaries receive informational requests from governmental authorities. Further, the SEC continues to underscore that investment advisers are fiduciaries, and as such, owe a duty of care and duty of loyalty to clients and investors, continue to demonstrate compliance with new regulations, identify and disclose conflicts of interests, and implement effective compliance programs specifically tailored to the investment adviser’s business. With respect to brokerdealers, the SEC and other federal, state and self-regulatory agencies regularly focuses on issues including, but not limited to, suitability, appropriateness of sale charges and non-cash compensation. There have been a number of revisions to existing, or proposals to modify or enact new, laws and regulations regarding insurance agents and brokers, investment advisers, and broker-dealers. These actions have imposed or could impose additional obligations on us with respect to our products sold and how we conduct our insurance, investment advisory and/or broker-dealer business, including compliance with new regulations. Some insurance companies have agreed with regulatory authorities to end the payment of contingent commissions on insurance products, which could impact our commissions that are based on the volume, consistency and profitability of business generated by us. ----- We cannot predict the impact that any new laws, rules or regulations may have on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Given the current regulatory environment and the number of our subsidiaries operating in local markets throughout the country, it is possible that we will become subject to further governmental inquiries and subpoenas and have lawsuits filed against us. Regulators may raise issues during investigations, examinations or audits that could, if determined adversely, have a material impact on us. The interpretations of regulations by regulators may change and statutes may be enacted with retroactive impact. We could also be materially adversely affected by any new industry-wide regulations or practices that may result from these proceedings. Our involvement in any investigations and lawsuits would cause us to incur additional legal and other costs and, if we were found to have violated any laws, we could be required to pay fines, damages and other costs, perhaps in material amounts. Regardless of final costs, these matters could have a material adverse effect on us by exposing us to negative publicity, reputational damage, harm to client relationships or diversion of personnel and management resources. The cost to defend such litigation may be significant. There may also be adverse publicity associated with litigation, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable.

The placement of insurance and the handling of claims involve substantial amounts of money. Since E&O claims against us may allege our potential liability for all or part of the amounts in question, claimants may seek large damage awards, including punitive and treble damages.

From time to time, U.S. federal, state and local and foreign governments make substantive changes to tax rules and their application, which could result in materially higher corporate taxes than would be incurred under existing tax law and could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.

Assuming the Revolving Credit Facility is fully drawn, each 0.125% change in assumed blended interest rates would result in an approximately $8.0 million change in annual interest expense on indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facilities. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,298

No appraisal of the value of the collateral has been made in connection with this offering, and we cannot assure you that the value of the collateral is equal to or greater than our obligations with respect to the notes, the guarantees and the First Lien Credit Facilities. In addition, the fair market value of the collateral is subject to fluctuations based on factors that include, among others, general economic conditions. The amount to be received upon a sale of the collateral would be dependent on numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the actual fair market value of the collateral at such time, the timing and the manner of the sale and the availability of buyers. Likewise, we cannot assure you that the collateral will be saleable or, if saleable, that there will not be substantial delays in its liquidation. In the event of a foreclosure, liquidation, bankruptcy or similar proceeding, the collateral may not be sold in a timely or orderly manner, and the proceeds from any sale or liquidation of the collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the issuers’ and the guarantors’ obligations under the notes, the guarantees, the First Lien Credit Facilities and any future debt that is secured by the collateral. The indenture will allow us to incur additional secured debt, including under certain circumstances, secured debt that will share in the collateral that will secure the notes and the guarantees. To the extent that pre-existing liens, liens permitted under the indenture and other rights, such as those securing certain purchase money obligations and capital lease obligations granted to other parties (in addition to the holders of obligations secured by first-priority liens), encumber any of the collateral, those parties have or may exercise rights and remedies with respect to the collateral that could adversely affect the value of the collateral and the ability of the Notes Collateral Agent or the holders of the notes to realize or foreclose on the collateral. The security interests in the collateral also will be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests in collateral. For example, the consent of a third-party may be required to obtain or enforce a security interest in a contract. We cannot assure you that any such consent could be obtained. We also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given when and if required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Notes Collateral Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets and the value of the collateral may be significantly impaired. In addition, our business requires compliance with numerous U.S. federal, state, provincial and local license and permit requirements. Continued operation of our properties that are part of the collateral will depend on the continued compliance with such license and permit requirements to the extent applicable, and our business and the value of the collateral may be adversely affected if we fail to comply with these requirements or changes in these requirements. In the event of foreclosure, the transfer of such permits and licenses may be prohibited or may require us to incur significant cost and expense. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that the applicable governmental authorities will consent to the transfer of all such permits. If the regulatory approvals required for such transfer are not obtained or are delayed, the foreclosure may be delayed, our operations may be shut down and the value of the collateral may be significantly impaired. There may not be sufficient collateral to pay off any amounts we may borrow under the notes, the First Lien Credit Facilities and any other secured indebtedness we incur that ranks pari passu with or prior to the notes. Consequently, liquidating the collateral may not result in proceeds in an amount sufficient to pay any amounts due under the notes, the First Lien Credit Facilities and such other pari passu lien indebtedness after satisfying the obligations to pay any creditors with prior liens. If the proceeds of the sale of the collateral pledged in relation to the notes are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the notes, the First Lien Credit Facilities and such other pari passu lien indebtedness, the holders of the notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the collateral) would have only an unsecured claim against the issuers’ and the guarantors’ remaining assets, which may not be sufficient to repay our obligations under the notes. In any bankruptcy proceeding with respect to an issuer or any of the guarantors that have guaranteed the notes, it is possible that the bankruptcy trustee, the debtor-in-possession or competing creditors will assert that the fair market value of the collateral with respect to the notes on the date of the bankruptcy filing was less than the then-current principal amount of the notes and all of our other outstanding obligations secured by a senior or pari _passu lien on the collateral. Upon a finding by the bankruptcy court that the notes are undercollateralized, the claims_ in the bankruptcy proceeding with respect to the notes would be bifurcated between a secured claim and an ----- unsecured deficiency claim, and such unsecured claim would not be entitled to the benefits of security in the collateral. In such event, the secured claims of the holders of the notes would be limited to the value of the collateral. In addition, the holders of the notes would not be entitled to receive post-petition interest or applicable fees, costs, expenses, or charges to the extent the amount of the obligations due under the notes, the First Lien Credit Facilities and such other pari passu lien indebtedness exceeded the value of the collateral, or any “adequate protection” on account of any undersecured portion of the notes.",N/A,as_expected,2024,298

Under the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, any actions that may be taken with respect to collateral, including the ability to cause the commencement of enforcement proceedings against such collateral or to control such proceedings, will be initially at the direction of the First Lien Credit Facilities Collateral Agent until 120 days after the occurrence of an event of default under the agreement governing and acceleration of the series of obligations representing the next largest outstanding principal amount of indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority (as defined under “Description of the Notes”) and applicable notice from the collateral agent with respect to such obligations; provided that such 120-day period shall be stayed with respect to any collateral if the First Lien Credit Facilities Collateral Agent has commenced and is diligently pursuing an enforcement action with respect to such collateral or the grantor of the security interest in such collateral (whether an issuer or the applicable guarantor) is then a debtor under or with respect to (or otherwise subject to) an insolvency or liquidation proceeding. In addition, under the terms of the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, if at any time the Applicable Authorized Representative (as defined under “Description of the Notes”) forecloses upon or otherwise exercises remedies against any collateral resulting in a sale thereof, the lien securing the notes and the guarantees on such collateral will be automatically released and discharged. If an issuer issues additional indebtedness that is senior to or equal in priority to the lien securing such issuer’s notes in the future in a greater principal amount than the notes, then the authorized representative for such additional indebtedness would be next in line to exercise rights under the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, rather than the Notes Collateral Agent. Accordingly, the Notes Collateral Agent may never have the right to control remedies and take other actions with respect to the collateral. In addition, under the terms of the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, if at any time the Applicable Authorized Representative forecloses upon or otherwise exercises remedies against any collateral resulting in a sale thereof, the lien securing the notes on such collateral will be automatically released and discharged. The collateral so released will no longer secure the issuers’ and the guarantors’ obligations under the notes and the related guarantees. The holders of the notes will also waive certain important rights otherwise available to secured creditors in a bankruptcy, as the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement will prohibit the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent from objecting following the filing of a bankruptcy petition to a proposed debtor-in-possession financing to be provided to us that is secured by the collateral or to the use of cash collateral that has not been opposed to or objected to by the Applicable Authorized Representative or the other controlling secured parties, subject to certain conditions and limited exceptions. After such a filing, the value of the collateral could materially deteriorate, and holders of the notes would be unable to raise an objection. Also, under the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, in the event that the holders of the notes obtain possession of any collateral or realize any proceeds or payment in respect of any such collateral at any time prior to the discharge of each of the other pari passu obligations, then such holders will be obligated to hold such collateral, proceeds, or payment in trust for the other holders of such obligations and, subject to the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, promptly transfer such collateral, proceeds or payment, as the case may be, to the Applicable Authorized Representative, to be distributed in accordance with the provisions of the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement among all the holders of such obligations. Thus, under the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, the holders of the notes may be obligated to turn over to the other holders of the pari passu obligations any collateral, proceeds or payments they may receive. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,298

While the relevant laws may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, the incurrence of the obligations in respect of the notes and the guarantees (and the related security interests), will generally be a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer if (i) the transactions relating to the issuance of the notes or guarantees (or the related security interests) were undertaken with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors or (ii) an issuer or any of the guarantors, as applicable, received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration in return for issuing either the notes or a guarantee (or the related security interests) and, in the case of (ii) only, any one of the following is also true: - an issuer or any of the guarantors was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of issuing the notes or the guarantees (or the related security interests); - the issuance of the notes or guarantees (or the related security interests) left an issuer or any of the guarantors with an unreasonably small amount of capital to carry on the business in which such issuer or such guarantor was engaged or about to engage; or - an issuer or any of the guarantors intended to, or believed that we or it would, incur debts beyond our or its ability to pay as they become due. If a court were to find that the issuance of the notes or a guarantee (or the related security interests) was a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer, the court could void the payment obligations under the notes or such guarantee or further subordinate the notes or such guarantee to presently existing and future indebtedness of such issuer or such guarantor, or require the holders of the notes to repay any amounts received with respect to the notes or such guarantee, or the holders of the notes could lose the benefits such security interests were intended to provide. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer occurred, you may not receive any repayment on the notes. Further, the voidance of the notes could result in an event of default with respect to our other debt and that of the guarantors that could result in acceleration of such debt. The measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon the law of the jurisdiction that is being applied, such that we cannot be certain as to: the standards a court would use to determine whether or not the issuers or the guarantors were solvent at the relevant time, or, regardless of the standard that a court uses, that it would not determine that the issuers or a guarantor was indeed insolvent on that date; that any payments to the holders of the notes (including under the guarantees) did not constitute preferences, fraudulent transfers or conveyances on other grounds; or that the issuance of the notes and the guarantees would not be subordinated to the issuers’ or any guarantor’s other debt. ----- Generally, an entity would be considered insolvent if, at the time it incurred indebtedness: - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair value of all its assets; - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts and liabilities, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or - it could not pay its debts as they become due. As a general matter, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or obligation, property is transferred or a valid antecedent debt is satisfied. A court would likely find that an issuer or a guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the notes or such guarantee (or the related security interests) if such issuer or such guarantor did not substantially benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the notes or the applicable guarantee (or the related security interest). Thus, if the guarantees were legally challenged, any guarantee could be subject to the claim that, since the guarantee was incurred for the issuers’ benefit, and only indirectly for the benefit of the guarantor, the obligations of the applicable guarantor were incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration. Therefore, a court could void the obligations under the guarantees, subordinate them to the applicable guarantor’s other debt or take other action detrimental to the holders of the notes. To the extent a court avoids any of the guarantees as fraudulent transfers or fraudulent conveyances or holds any of the guarantees unenforceable for any other reason, the holders of notes would cease to have any direct claim against the applicable guarantor. If a court were to take this action, the applicable guarantor’s assets would be applied first to satisfy the applicable guarantor’s other liabilities, if any, and might not be applied to the payment of the guarantee. Sufficient funds to repay the notes may not be available from other sources, including the remaining guarantors, if any. In addition, the court might direct you to repay any amounts that you already received from the applicable issuer or the applicable guarantor. Although each guarantee entered into in connection with the notes will contain a provision intended to limit that guarantor’s liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its guarantee to be a fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance, this provision may not be effective as a legal matter or otherwise to protect those guarantees from being avoided under fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance law or otherwise, or may reduce that guarantor’s obligation to an amount that effectively makes its guarantee worthless. In addition, any payment by an issuer pursuant to the notes or by a guarantor under a guarantee made at a time such issuer or such guarantor was found to be insolvent could be voided as a preferential transfer and required to be returned to such issuer or such guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of such issuer’s or such guarantor’s creditors if such payment is made to an insider within a one-year period prior to a bankruptcy filing or within 90 days for any non-insider party, and such payment would give such insider or non-insider party more than such creditors would have received in a distribution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in a hypothetical Chapter 7 case. Finally, as a court of equity, the bankruptcy court may otherwise subordinate the claims in respect of the notes or the guarantees to other claims against the issuers or the guarantors under the principle of equitable subordination, if the court determines that: (i) the holder of the notes engaged in some type of inequitable conduct; (ii) such inequitable conduct resulted in injury to our other creditors or conferred an unfair advantage upon the holder of the notes; and (iii) equitable subordination is not inconsistent with the provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.",N/A,as_expected,2024,298

In particular, upon the commencement of a case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, a secured creditor such as the Notes Collateral Agent is prohibited from foreclosing upon or repossessing its collateral from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from disposing of collateral previously repossessed from such debtor, without prior bankruptcy court approval, which may not be given under the circumstances. Moreover, the U.S. Bankruptcy Code permits the debtor to continue to retain and use cash and other collateral even though the debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments, provided that the secured creditor is given “adequate protection.” The meaning of the term “adequate protection” may vary according to circumstances, but it is intended in general to protect the value of a secured creditor’s interest in its collateral as of the commencement of the bankruptcy case and may include cash payments or the granting of additional or replacement collateral if and at such times as the bankruptcy court in its discretion determines that the value of the secured creditor’s interest in its collateral is declining during the pendency of the bankruptcy case. A bankruptcy court may determine that a secured creditor may not require compensation for a diminution in the value of its collateral if the value of the collateral exceeds the debt it secures. In view of the lack of a precise definition of the term “adequate protection” and the broad discretionary power of a bankruptcy court, it is impossible to predict: - whether or when payments under the notes could be made following the commencement of a bankruptcy case by the issuers or a guarantor, or the length of any delay in making such payments; - whether or when the Notes Collateral Agent could or would repossess or dispose of the collateral; - the value of the collateral at the time of the bankruptcy petition or at any other point in time thereafter; or - whether or to what extent the holders of the notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the collateral through the requirement for “adequate protection” or otherwise. Any disposition of the collateral during a bankruptcy case would also require prior permission from the bankruptcy court (which may not be given under the circumstances). Furthermore, in the event a bankruptcy court determines the value of the collateral is not sufficient to repay all amounts due on our other debt that is also to be paid first out of the proceeds of the collateral (including our obligations under the First Lien Term Loan Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility), the holders of the notes would hold a secured claim only to the extent of the value of the collateral to which the noteholders are entitled and an unsecured claim with respect to any shortfall. The U.S. Bankruptcy Code permits the payment and accrual of post-petition interest, costs, expenses and attorneys’ fees or “adequate protection” to a secured creditor during a debtor’s bankruptcy case only to the extent the value of its collateral is determined by the bankruptcy court to exceed the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the obligations secured by the collateral, and such amounts would not be permitted to be paid if the collateral value is not sufficient.

Applicable law requires that a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be properly perfected and its priority retained through certain actions undertaken by the secured party. The liens on the collateral securing the notes may ----- not be perfected if we are not able to take the actions necessary to perfect any of these liens on or prior to the date of the issuance of the notes or thereafter as the indenture will permit us to perfect certain liens after the issue date. We will have limited obligations to perfect the security interest of the holders of the notes in specified collateral other than the filing of financing statements. To the extent a security interest in certain collateral is not properly perfected on the date of the issuance of the notes, such security interest might be avoidable in bankruptcy, which could impact the value of the collateral. See “—Any future security interest or guarantee may be avoidable in bankruptcy.” If additional material wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries are formed or acquired and become guarantors under the indenture that will govern notes, additional financing statements would be required to be filed to perfect the security interest in the assets of such guarantors. Depending on the type of the assets constituting afteracquired collateral, additional action may be required to perfect the security interest in such assets. Applicable law requires that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest can be perfected only at the time such property and rights are acquired and identified. Neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent will be responsible to monitor, and the issuers may not inform the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent of, the future acquisition of property and rights that constitute collateral, and that the necessary action will be taken to properly perfect the security interest in such after-acquired collateral. None of the Trustee, the Notes Collateral Agent and the First Lien Credit Facilities Collateral Agent will have any obligation to monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights that constitute collateral or monitor the perfection of, or make filings to perfect or maintain the perfection of, any security interests therein. Such inaction may result in the loss of the security interest in such collateral or the priority of the security interest in favor of the notes and the guarantees against third parties. Even if the liens on collateral acquired or arising in the future are not properly perfected, such liens may potentially be avoidable as a preference or as a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer in any bankruptcy proceeding under certain circumstances. See “—Any future security interest or guarantee may be avoidable in bankruptcy” and “— Federal and state fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance laws permit a court, under certain circumstances, to void the notes and the guarantees (and the related security interests), and, if that occurs, you may not receive any payments on the notes.”",N/A,as_expected,2024,298

Consequently, if a default should occur prior to the perfection of such security interests, holders of the notes may not benefit from any such unperfected security interests. The delivery of security interests in certain collateral, including after-acquired property, is also expected to be made after the Completion Date. If the grantor of any such security interest were to become subject to a bankruptcy proceeding, any liens recorded or perfected or any mortgages delivered after the Completion Date would face a greater risk of being invalidated than if they had been recorded, perfected or delivered on the Completion Date. In bankruptcy proceedings commenced within 90 days of lien perfection or mortgage delivery, a lien or mortgage given to secure previously existing debt is significantly more likely to be voided as a preference by the bankruptcy court than if delivered and promptly recorded on the Completion Date (or within 30 days thereof). Accordingly, if a grantor were to file for bankruptcy protection after the Completion Date and the liens had been perfected or the mortgages had been delivered less than 90 days before commencement of such bankruptcy proceeding (or within a year for an “insider”), or not yet perfected or delivered at all, the liens or mortgages securing the notes may be especially subject to challenge as a result of having not been perfected or delivered on the Completion Date (or within 30 days thereof). To the extent that such challenge succeeded, you would lose the benefit of the security that the collateral was intended to provide and could be required to return amounts already paid. If the grantor of any such security interest were to become subject to a bankruptcy proceeding, any liens recorded or perfected or any mortgage or security interest in collateral delivered by such grantor after the Completion Date may face a greater risk of being voidable as a preference under bankruptcy law than if such liens or security interests had been recorded, perfected or delivered on the Completion Date (or within 30 days thereof). Liens recorded or perfected or any mortgages delivered after the Completion Date (or within 30 days thereof) may be treated under bankruptcy law as if they were delivered to secure previously existing indebtedness. If certain circumstances exist or occur (including if the person pledging or granting such security interest is insolvent at the ----- time of the pledge or grant of the security interest), if the pledge or security interest permits the holders of the notes to receive a greater recovery than such holders would have received in a distribution in a hypothetical Chapter 7 case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code than if the security interest had not been pledged or granted, and a bankruptcy proceeding in respect of the grantor is commenced within 90 days following the pledge or grant, or, within a oneyear period if it is granted or pledged to an insider, such pledge or grant of such security interest may face a greater risk of being voidable as a preference under bankruptcy law by the pledgor (as debtor in possession) or by its trustee in bankruptcy or other third parties.

Any future pledge or perfection of collateral or issuance of a guarantee in favor of the holders of the notes (including any Liens delivered or reinstated after the Reversion Date and/or pursuant to guarantees delivered in connection therewith after the date the notes are issued) may be avoidable by the pledgor (as a debtor in possession), guarantor (as a debtor in possession), by its trustee in bankruptcy, or potentially by other creditors if certain events or circumstances exist or occur, including, among others, if (1) the pledgor or guarantor is insolvent at the time of the pledge or perfection and/or issuance of the guarantee, (2) the pledge or perfection and/or issuance of the guarantee (as applicable) permits the holders of the notes to receive a greater recovery in a hypothetical Chapter 7 case than if such pledge or perfection and/or guarantee (as applicable) had not been given and (3) a bankruptcy proceeding in respect of the pledgor or guarantor is commenced within 90 days following the pledge or the perfection thereof as the case may be, and/or the issuance of the guarantee (as applicable), or, in certain circumstances, one year.

In order to obtain sufficient funds to pay the purchase price of the outstanding notes, we expect that we would have to refinance the notes. We cannot assure you that we would be able to refinance the notes on reasonable terms, if at all. The issuers’ failure to offer to purchase all outstanding notes or to purchase all validly tendered notes would be an event of default under the indenture that will govern the notes.

The source of funds for any such purchase of the notes will be the issuers’ available cash or cash generated from the issuers’ operations or other sources, including borrowings, sales of assets or sales of equity.

The court adjudicating that case might find that the Escrow Account and the Escrowed Property are the property of the bankruptcy estate. Although the amounts in the Escrow Account will be pledged as security for the notes during the term of the escrow, the automatic stay provisions of the federal bankruptcy laws generally prohibit (or at a minimum delay) secured creditors from foreclosing upon or disposing of a debtor’s property without prior bankruptcy court approval (which may not be given under the facts and circumstances). As a result, holders of the notes may not be able to have the funds in the Escrow Account applied at the time or in the manner contemplated by the indenture that will govern the notes and could suffer a loss as a result. If the court adjudicating that case finds that the Escrow Account and Escrowed Property are the property of the bankruptcy estate, the court could authorize the use of such funds by the bankruptcy estate or the bankruptcy trustee, if one is appointed, with or without restrictions. As a result, the holders of the notes could become unsecured creditors of the bankruptcy estate.

If interest rates increase, the debt service obligations on the loans would increase and cash required for servicing indebtedness would increase.

The increase is composed of: (i) a $241 million increase in base commissions, which reflects a growth rate of 10%, driven by (a) $114 million from the acquisition of BenefitMall in September 2022, which, due to timing, led to only a partial year’s contribution in terms of commission revenues for 2022 versus a full year for 2023 and (b) $174 million from growth in new and retained business in the Retail and Wholesale segments; partially offset by a (a) $34 million decrease related to certain businesses within the Wholesale segment covering catastrophic property & casualty risks and (b) $13 million decrease related to the Services segment due to rising interest rates, which was partially offset by the March 2022 acquisition of Kensington Vanguard which contributed a full year of revenues for 2023 versus a partial year for 2022; and (ii) a $96 million increase in fees, which reflects a growth rate of 21%, driven by (a) $33 million increase in the Retail segment driven by rising premiums driving more insureds to fee arrangements, (b) $60 million increase in the Wholesale segment primarily driven by increases in underwriting program fees, and (c) $3 million increase in the Services segment primarily driven by increases in fees from 1031 exchange services due to higher interest rates; partially offset by (iii) a $1 million decrease in supplemental and contingent commissions, driven by a $14 million net decrease in the Wholesale segment driven by adverse developments in ultimate loss ratios and increasing rates of catastrophes, partially offset by (a) an $8 million increase in the Retail segment driven by overall premium growth and (b) $5 million from the BenefitMall acquisition that less comparable revenues (i.e., over a shorter period) in 2022. _Investment Income_ |(Dollars in millions) 2023|% Change|2022| |---|---|---| |Revenues Commissions and fees $ 3,388 Investment income 66 Other income 13|11 % 100 % (59) %|$ 3,051 — 32| |Total revenues 3,467|12 %|3,083| |Expenses Compensation and benefits 2,210 Other operating expenses 514 Amortization 134 Depreciation 23 Impairment loss on goodwill 195 Interest 317|15 % 21 % 5 % (—) % 100 % 100 %|1,914 424 127 23 — —| |Total expenses 3,393|36 %|2,488| |Income before income taxes 74 Income tax (benefit) expense (136)|(87) % (191) %|595 150| |Net income $ 210 Net (loss) income attributable to non-controlling interests $ (7)|(53) % (213) %|$ 445 $ 6| |Net income attributable to controlling interests $ 217|(50) %|$ 439| ----- Investment income for 2023 was $66 million, compared with an immaterial amount in 2022. The increase was primarily driven by a movement of funds to interest-bearing deposit accounts in 2023 to support the Company’s standalone operations. _Other Income_ Other income for 2023 was $13 million, compared with $32 million in 2022. Other income primarily relates to income from non-recurring legal settlements and other miscellaneous income and therefore can fluctuate between comparable periods. _Compensation and Benefits_ Compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of total revenues was 64% for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to 62% for the year ended December 31, 2022, and increased $296 million or 15% from 2022. The increase was primarily due to: (i) increase of $89 million related to the BenefitMall and Kensington Vanguard acquisitions; (ii) increase in severance expenses of $23 million related to a strategic restructuring in 2023; and (iii) the remaining $184 million increase primarily relates to increased producer compensation attributed to revenue growth as well as an increase in employee compensation attributed to increased headcount and acquisition earnouts. _Other Operating Expenses_ Other operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues was 15% for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to 14% for the year ended December 31, 2022. Other operating expenses for 2023 increased $90 million, or 21%, for the same period of 2022. The increase was primarily due to: (i) expenses of $21 million relating to legal matters; (ii) expenses of $24 million related to corporate allocations due to an increase in allocated costs from TFC for corporate functions; (iii) a $25 million increase in software expense; (iv) an increase of $9 million related to the BenefitMall and Kensington Vanguard acquisitions; (v) an increase of $32 million primarily relating to variable travel and entertainment costs due to post-COVID increases in travel; partially offset by (vi) a $21 million reduction in merger-related costs due to no acquisitions in 2023. _Amortization_ Amortization expense for 2023 increased $7 million to $134 million, or 5% over 2022. The increase reflects the amortization of new intangibles that were accounted for as asset acquisitions, net of certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized or written off. _Depreciation_ Depreciation expense stayed the same at $23 million for 2023 compared to 2022. _Impairment loss on Goodwill_ During 2023, the Services segment observed declines in forecasted income due to a decline in commercial and residential real estate transactions attributable to rising interest rates. The Company concluded that these factors were indicative of a triggering event that required the Company to perform an interim quantitative goodwill impairment assessment. The results of the quantitative impairment assessment indicated that the carrying value of the Services segment exceeded its fair value. As a result, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment loss of $195 million in the year ended December 31, 2023, which reduced the goodwill in the Services segment to zero. There was no impairment loss on goodwill recorded in 2022. _Interest Expense_ Interest expense for 2023 was $317 million which was primarily attributable to the preferred units issued in April 2023. Due to the mandatory redemption feature, the preferred units are classified as liabilities rather than as a ----- component of equity, with the preferred annual returns of 8% per annum being accrued and recorded as Interest in the consolidated statements of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2023, of the total Interest expense, $315 million related to the preferred units, of which $210 million was paid during the period. As the preferred units were issued in April 2023, the Company did not recognize interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2022. For more information relating to the preferred units, refer to Note 9. Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Units to the consolidated financial statements that are included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. _Income Taxes_ As Truist Insurance Holdings, Inc. was converted into a Delaware limited liability company (the “Partnership Conversion”) named Truist Insurance Holdings, LLC in February 2023, the provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2022 reflects the impacts of U.S. corporate taxation at an effective tax rate of 25%; whereas the provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2023 is reflective of (i) the discretely calculated corporate tax impacts for January and February 2023 (prior to the Partnership Conversion) of $29 million, (ii) the tax benefit associated with the corporate deferred tax liability transfer to the Parent of $166 million, (iii) the tax benefit associated with the transfer of the unrecognized tax benefit to the Parent of $1 million, and (iv) tax impacts attributable to the remaining ten months in the year, calculated on a post Partnership Conversion basis. For periods after the Partnership Conversion, federal income taxes will not be allocated to TIH, its subsidiary partnerships, or subsidiary disregarded entities; as such, the applicable federal statutory tax rate impact for the year ended December 31, 2023 is zero.

The increase is composed of: (i) a $327 million increase in Base Commissions, which reflects a growth rate of 15% driven by (a) $43 million and $63 million from the BenefitMall and Kensington Vanguard acquisitions, ----- respectively, for which there were no comparable Base Commissions for 2021 and $69 million from the Constellation acquisition, which, due to timing, led to only a partial year’s contribution in terms of Base Commissions for 2021, (b) $152 million from growth in new and retained business in the Retail and Wholesale segments; (ii) a $70 million increase in Fees, which reflects a growth rate of 18%, driven by (a) $16 million from the Kensington Vanguard which had no comparable Fees for 2021 and $34 million from the Constellation acquisitions, which due to timing, led to only a partial year’s contribution in terms of Fees for 2021, (b) $12 million net increase in the Wholesale segment primarily driven by increases in underwriting program fees and brokerage fee income, and (c) $8 million increase in the Retail segment driven by rising premiums driving more insureds to fee arrangements; and (iii) a $15 million increase in Supplemental and Contingent Commissions, driven by (a) $6 million from the BenefitMall acquisition which had no comparable revenues for 2021 and the Constellation acquisitions which, due to timing led to only a partial year’s contribution in terms of revenues for 2021 and (b) $9 million increase in the Retail segment driven by overall premium growth. _Other Income_ Other income for 2022 was $32 million, compared with $11 million in 2021. Other income primarily relates to income from non-recurring legal settlements and other miscellaneous income and therefore can fluctuate between comparable periods. _Compensation and Benefits_ Compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of total revenues was 62% for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to 62% for the year ended December 31, 2021, and increased 17%, or $271 million. The increase was primarily due to (i) increase of $140 million related to the BenefitMall, Kensington Vanguard, and Constellation acquisitions, (ii) the remaining $131 million increase primarily relates to increased producer compensation attributed to revenue growth. _Other Operating Expenses_ Other operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues was 13.8% for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to 12% for the year ended December 31, 2021. Other operating expenses for 2022 increased $110 million, or 35%, for the same period of 2021. The increase was primarily due to: (i) increase of $29 million related to the BenefitMall, Kensington Vanguard, and Constellation acquisitions, and due to timing of these acquisitions, there were no comparable other operating expenses for BenefitMall and Kensington Vanguard and a partial year’s contribution of other operating expenses for Constellation in 2021; (ii) expenses of $24 million related to corporate allocations due to an increase in allocated costs from TFC for corporate functions; (iii) increase of $14 million of merger-related costs due to 2022 acquisitions; and the remaining $43 million increase primarily relates to variable travel and entertainment costs due to post-COVID increases in travel. _Amortization_ Amortization expense for 2022 increased $25 million to $127 million, or 25% over 2021. The increase reflects the amortization of new intangibles that were recognized in connection with the acquisitions of Constellation, BenefitMall and Kensington Vanguard, net of certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized or written off. _Depreciation_ ----- Depreciation expense for 2022 increased $3 million to $23 million, or 14% from 2021. Changes in depreciation expense reflect net additions of fixed assets, net of the impact of fixed assets that became fully depreciated during the period. _Income Taxes_ Income tax expense for 2022 increased $12 million to $150 million, or 8% from 2021. The provisions for income taxes represent effective tax rates of 25% and 24% for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.",N/A,as_expected,2024,298

The amount of cash required to fund the Transactions will be reduced based on the amount of TIH shares contributed by existing TIH equityholders in the Rollover. The amount of cash required to fund the Transactions, as well as the cash and cash equivalent on the Company’s balance sheet at the closing of the Transactions, may be impacted by the timing of the Acquisition, differences from estimated fees and expenses and working capital requirements. See “Use of Proceeds” and “Capitalization.” We expect the cash requirements of the Transactions to be financed through the net proceeds from this offering, proceeds from our Senior Credit Facilities and the Equity Contribution. Following the closing of the Transactions, we believe that our cash on hand and availability under the Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to cover our operating expenses in the near term. We expect the Revolving Credit Facility to be undrawn at the closing of the Acquisition. The amount drawn on the Revolving Credit Facility after giving effect to the Transactions is subject to change based on the timing of the closing of the Acquisition and working capital requirements at the time of closing of the Acquisition. Upon completion of this offering, our long-term debt for borrowed money will be comprised of the notes and indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facilities. After the consummation of the Transactions, our primary sources of liquidity will be cash on the balance sheet, cash generated by operations and borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. Our primary uses of cash after the consummation of the Transactions will be working capital requirements, debt service requirements and capital expenditures. Based on our current level of operations and available cash, we believe our cash flows from operations, combined with availability under the Revolving Credit Facility, will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our current obligations, projected working capital requirements, debt service requirements and capital spending requirements over the next twelve months and the foreseeable future. We cannot assure you, however, that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under the Revolving Credit Facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness, including the notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs. Our ability to do so depends on prevailing economic conditions, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain events, such as a change of control, we could be required to repay or refinance our indebtedness. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness, including the Senior Credit Facilities and the notes, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Any future acquisitions, joint ventures or other similar transactions will likely require additional capital, and there can be no assurance that any such capital will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. After the consummation of the Transactions, we will be highly leveraged. On an as adjusted basis giving effect to the Transactions, as of December 31, 2023, we would have had outstanding $8,000 million in aggregate ----- indebtedness for borrowed money (excluding capital and financing leases), with approximately $1,175 million available for borrowing under our Revolving Credit Facility (assuming it is undrawn at closing). Our liquidity requirements will be significant, primarily due to debt service requirements. On an as adjusted basis giving effect to the Transactions, our cash interest expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 would have been approximately $674.8 million. Assuming the Revolving Credit Facility is fully drawn, each 0.125% change in assumed blended interest rates would result in an approximately $8.0 million change in annual interest expense on indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facilities. From time to time, depending upon market and other conditions, as well as upon our cash balances and liquidity, we, our subsidiaries or our affiliates may acquire our outstanding debt securities or our other indebtedness through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, tender offers, redemption or otherwise, upon such terms and at such prices as we, our subsidiaries or our affiliates may determine (or as may be provided for in the indentures, if applicable), for cash or other consideration.

1994_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.11,Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,17.11.1,,"Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity prices. We are exposed to market risk through our investments and the Senior Credit Facilities. Our invested assets are held primarily as cash and cash equivalents and fiduciary cash. These investments are subject to interest rate risk. The fair value of our invested assets at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, approximated their respective carrying values due to their short-term duration and therefore, such market risk is not considered to be material. We do not actively invest or trade in equity securities. In addition, we generally dispose of any equity securities received in conjunction with an acquisition shortly after the acquisition date. Our principal exposure to market risk following the Transactions will relate to changes in interest rates on borrowings under the Senior Credit Facilities. The Senior Credit Facilities will carry floating interest rates that are tied to SOFR, and therefore, our statement of consolidated operations data and our cash flows will be exposed to changes in interest rates to the extent that we do not have effective hedging arrangements in place. As of December 31, 2023, on an as adjusted basis after giving effect to the Transactions, we would have had approximately $5,250 million of outstanding debt at variable interest rates (assuming the Revolving Credit Facility is undrawn at closing of the Transactions). If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on our variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, would correspondingly decrease. Assuming the Revolving Credit Facility is fully drawn, each 0.125% change in assumed blended interest rates would result in an approximately $8.0 million change in annual interest expense on indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facilities. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes; however, this does not preclude our adoption of specific hedging strategies in the future.",N/A,as_expected,2024,298
1994_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.12,Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates,17.12.1,Contingent Revenues,"We generate contingent revenues from contracts with insurance carriers for which we are compensated for certain growth, profitability, or other performance-based metrics. These amounts are variable and in excess of commission and fee revenues. Not all policies placed with participating insurance carriers are eligible for contingent revenues. Our performance obligation of achieving these metrics is satisfied over time, and revenue is therefore recognized over time using a time-based measure of progress. Accordingly, we estimate the amount of consideration that will be received, such that a significant reversal of revenue is not probable. Estimates are determined each period on a contract-by-contract or carrier-by-carrier basis, where available. In certain cases, it is impractical to assess a very large number of smaller contingent revenue contracts, so we use a historical portfolio estimate in aggregate. Because the expectation of the contingent revenue amounts to be earned can vary from period to period, especially in contracts sensitive to loss ratios, the estimates might change significantly from quarter to quarter. Variable consideration is recognized when we conclude, based on all the facts and information available at the reporting date, that it is probable that a significant revenue reversal will not occur in future periods. For more information, refer to Note 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 4. Revenue Recognition to the consolidated financial statements that are included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. _Judgments and Uncertainties_ Because our expectation of the ultimate contingent revenue amounts to be earned can vary from period to period, especially in contracts sensitive to loss ratios, our estimates might change significantly from quarter to quarter. For example, in circumstances where our revenues are dependent on a full calendar year loss ratio, adverse loss experience in the fourth quarter could not only negate revenue earnings in the fourth quarter, but also trigger the need to reverse revenues previously recognized during the prior quarters. Variable consideration is recognized when we conclude, based on all the facts and information available at the reporting date, that it is probable that a significant revenue reversal will not occur in future periods. _Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions_ We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to recognize revenue. As noted above, estimates are made based on historical experience and other factors. The vast majority of our contracts are for a period of one year or less, and historically, the difference between actual experience compared to estimated performance has not been significant to the annual financial statements.",N/A,as_expected,2024,298

If it is determined, based on qualitative factors, that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or if significant changes to macro-economic factors related to the reporting unit have occurred that could materially impact fair value, a quantitative goodwill impairment test would be required. The quantitative test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. Additionally, we can elect to forgo the qualitative assessment and perform the quantitative test. Upon performing the quantitative test, if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. We have elected to ----- make the first day of the fourth quarter the annual impairment assessment date for goodwill. However, we could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill outside of the required annual assessment if, among other things, we experience disruptions to the business, unexpected significant declines in operating results, divestiture of a significant component of the business or a sustained decline in market capitalization. We acquire intangible assets either individually or as part of a group of assets. We record intangible assets at fair value upon acquisition. In determining the fair value at the time of recognition, we primarily consider the present value of the underlying net cash flows expected to be generated by the corresponding asset or group of assets discounted at a market rate of interest. The determinations of fair value are based on estimates and assumptions related to the amount and timing of future cash flows and future interest rates. Such estimates and assumptions could change in the future as more information becomes known, which could impact the amounts reported and disclosed herein. For more information, refer to Note 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Note 6. Goodwill, and Note 7. Amortizable Intangible Assets to the consolidated financial statements that are included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. _Judgments and Uncertainties_ We estimate the fair value of our reporting units using both the income approach (discounted cash flow method) and the market approach (guideline public company method), which use significant unobservable inputs. We include assumptions about revenue growth, operating margins, discount rates and valuation multiples which consider our business plans and economic projections, and are believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction. Our goodwill impairment analysis contains uncertainties due to uncontrollable events that could positively or negatively impact the anticipated future economic and operating conditions. We apply judgment in determining the various assumptions used to estimate the fair value of our intangible assets, including useful lives and intended use of assets, observable market valuations, forecasted revenue growth, operating margins and discount rates based on budgets, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows. _Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions_ Some of the inherent estimates and assumptions used in determining fair value of our reporting units are outside the control of management, including interest rates, cost of capital, tax rates, market EBITDA comparables and credit ratings. While we believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to compute the fair value of the reporting units, a material change may still occur, which could result in material impairments of our goodwill if our actual results do not align with our estimations. While we do not anticipate any material changes in the factors used to calculate the fair value or useful lives of amortizable intangible assets, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used to calculate estimate future cash flows, we may be exposed to impairment losses that could be material.",N/A,as_expected,2024,298

Those costs are either (i) costs to obtain a contract, (ii) costs to fulfill a contract, or (iii) all other costs. We defer certain costs to obtain customer contracts, primarily incremental commissions paid to internal producers on new business. These incremental costs are deferred and amortized over a 15-year period. For all other incremental costs incurred to obtain customer contracts, we recognize the incremental costs of obtaining contracts as an expense when incurred, as the amortization period of the assets that otherwise would have been recognized is one year or less. We incur costs to fulfill a contract (or anticipated contract) with a customer that are expected to be recovered in the future. These costs relate to compensation and benefits of internal producers and related support ----- staff who perform policy placement services, and are incurred prior to the effective date of the underlying policy. Deferrable costs to fulfill relate to fulfillment activities, which include collecting underwriting information from insureds or agents of the insureds, assessing their insurance needs and negotiating their placement with one or more insurance carriers, and underwriting their risk. Deferrable costs to fulfill incurred prior to the policy effective date are capitalized and expensed on the policy effective date. Other costs that are not costs to obtain or fulfill are expensed as incurred. Examples include other operating costs such as rent, utilities, management costs, overhead costs, legal and other professional fees, technology costs, insurance related costs, communication and advertising, and travel and entertainment. Depreciation and amortization are expensed over the useful lives of the underlying assets. For more information, refer to Note 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 4. Revenue Recognition to the consolidated financial statements that are included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. _Judgments and Uncertainties_ Deferred costs contain uncertainties due to judgment in assumptions, including the period for which the deferred costs are amortized and the costs subject to deferral. Specifically, costs associated with obtaining the contract are amortized over a period of 15 years whereas the costs associated with fulfilling the contract are amortized over a period of 1-3 months. _Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions_ We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate deferred costs. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used to determine the amortization period and costs subject to deferral, we may be exposed to an increase or decrease in deferred costs that could be material.",N/A,as_expected,2024,298

In addition, during 2022, TFC adopted an employee stock purchase plan (the “ESPP”). Compensation cost has been allocated to the Company based on the awards and terms previously granted to TIH employees. We determine compensation cost associated with RSUs and PSUs based on the fair value of underlying TFC common stock on the date of grant less the present value of expected dividends that will be forgone during the vesting period. Compensation cost for RSAs and RSUs is generally recognized over the vesting period taking into account retirement eligibility. Forfeitures are recognized when they occur. For PSUs, compensation cost is recognized over the vesting period after considering the number of awards expected to vest based on the estimated probability of achieving the associated performance targets. On April 3, 2023, we adopted several equity incentive plans (referred to collectively as the “TIH Plans”) pursuant to which we may issue phantom equity units, phantom profits interests and profits interests to TIH employees and other service providers. The terms of such awards are further described in Note 13. Equity Incentive Compensation to the consolidated financial statements that are included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. Compensation cost for awards with solely time-based vesting conditions is recognized over the applicable requisite service period using the graded vesting method, taking into account accelerated vesting provisions for retirementeligible employees (applicable to the phantom equity units only). The phantom profits interests and certain of the profits interests contain event-based vesting conditions tied to a liquidity event. Qualifying liquidity events as defined in the TIH plans include a (i) ‘Change of Control’ as a result of any single transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which a different entity holds a majority of the Company’s voting power thereafter and (ii) an ‘Initial Public Offering’, including a transaction whereby the Company’s equity securities are exchanged or otherwise converted into securities that are publicly listed. To vest in the awards, recipients must remain employed at the time of the qualifying liquidity event. Additionally, based on the timing of the qualifying liquidity event, the ----- phantom profits interests and profits interests with event-based vesting conditions contain a post-transaction service requirement. Forfeitures on all awards are recorded when they occur. _Judgments and Uncertainties_ Our equity incentive compensation contains uncertainties due to judgment in assumptions, including (i) the estimated probability of achieving performance targets, (ii) inputs to determine the total equity value of TIH used to value the phantom equity units, and (iii) inputs to the Black-Scholes option pricing model used to value the phantom profits interests and profits interests. The fair value of the phantom equity units is determined based on the value of the underlying TIH common units (refer to the stock price input below, which describes how the fair value of TIH common units was determined) considering a discount for lack of marketability. The fair value of the Profits Interests is measured on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and is not remeasured. Refer to the notes to the consolidated financial statements that are included elsewhere in this offering memorandum for further information regarding the inputs used to value the phantom profits interests and profits interests (time-vested and event-vested), for grants issued during the year ended December 31, 2023. _Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions_ We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate compensation cost related to equity incentive compensation.

Income tax includes an estimate for withholding taxes on earnings of foreign subsidiaries expected to be remitted to the United States. Deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. We record unrecognized tax benefit liabilities for known or anticipated tax issues based on our analysis of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. As discussed in Note 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements that are included elsewhere in this offering memorandum, as a result of the Partnership Conversion during 2023, TIH is now predominantly composed of partnerships and disregarded entities held by other partnerships. As such, for periods after the Partnership Conversion, federal income taxes will not be allocated to TIH LLC, its subsidiary partnerships, or subsidiary disregarded entities. For more information, refer to Note 11. Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements that are included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. _Judgments and Uncertainties_ Our calculations related to income taxes contain uncertainties due to judgment used to calculate tax liabilities in the application of complex tax regulations across the tax jurisdictions where we operate. Our analysis of unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties based on judgment used to apply the more likely than not recognition and measurement thresholds. _Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions_ ----- Changes in tax laws and rates or the TIH organizational structure could affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Other than those potential impacts, we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change to tax related balances.

Admitted carriers typically sell standard insurance products for which insurance rates and risk coverages are relatively uniform and must comply with applicable laws and, in certain states, regulatory approval. Non-admitted carriers typically engage in the E&S lines market, taking on relatively specialized and complex risks that do not fit the underwriting criteria of standard insurance products. ----- Through the scope of our business activities as an insurance broker, we provide products and services to both the admitted and non-admitted insurance markets. Insurance brokers act as intermediaries between insureds and insurance carriers. Retail producers place P&C insurance coverages on behalf of businesses, public institutions and individual clients, negotiating with carriers for competitive rates and policy terms. Retail producers are typically compensated through commissions paid by carriers on the premium that is placed; however, they can also be paid on a fee basis for their insurance placement and other risk consultation services. Wholesale insurance brokers act as intermediaries between insurance carriers and retail producers by assisting retail producers in placing business that is outside of their core expertise or ability to place directly. Wholesale insurance brokers often provide retail insurance brokers with specialty and E&S insurance products. Wholesale brokers are typically compensated by commissions paid by the insurance carrier, although they can also receive fees in addition to commissions for placing certain insurance policies. In some cases, brokers can act as an MGA for insurance carriers. An MGA generally has authority to bind coverage on behalf of an insurance carrier for a specific type of risk, subject to agreed-upon guidelines and limits. An MGA generally does not assume underwriting risk for the products that it distributes. Historically, despite economic ebbs and flows, the P&C insurance sector has demonstrated resilient and stable growth. Total U.S. P&C direct written premiums increased each year between 1996 and 2023 (except during the 2008 global financial crisis), resulting in a 4.4% CAGR from 1996 to 2022. P&C premium growth tends to be less volatile than changes in insurance rates, which can fluctuate during soft and hard markets. During periods of declining premium rates (known as soft markets), insureds tend to increase limits on coverages, purchase new coverages and reduce deductibles. Conversely, during periods of increasing premium rates (known as hard markets), insureds typically lower coverages and maintain higher deductibles. Combined with overall economic growth, these dynamics have led to stable growth in P&C premiums over time. The P&C insurance brokerage market has seen a large amount of consolidation activity over the last decade as the industry shifts from a high degree of fragmentation to one where scaled, national platforms command a growing share of the market. However, despite substantial consolidation, more than 40,000 independent brokerage agencies were operating in the United States in 2022, an increase from 36,000 in 2020. We believe that this provides a stable basis for ongoing M&A activity in the sector.",N/A,as_expected,2024,298
1994_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.14,Our Industry,17.14.2,Employee Benefits Market,"Employee benefits brokers and consultants primarily cater to companies and their employees by offering a suite of health-related insurance products, including medical, life and disability coverages, as well as overseeing retirement and asset management programs. These experts act both as intermediaries and strategic planners, offering guidance on structuring benefit plans. As all-in-one solution providers, they enable middle-market businesses to outsource the complexities of benefits planning, oversight and administration, thus allowing these businesses to bypass the need for extensive internal infrastructure or significant investments in technology. Demand for employee benefits offerings is largely driven by overall employment levels. The primary driver of pricing for these products and services is healthcare spending. The design and execution of employee benefit strategies have become increasingly nuanced, especially against the backdrop of ongoing healthcare inflation and increased regulatory complexity. This evolving landscape underscores the growing relevance of adept benefits brokers with strong service offerings and expertise.",N/A,as_expected,2024,298

We primarily compete for business on the basis of reputation, relationships, client service, expertise, product offerings, and the ability to tailor our products and risk management services to meet the needs of clients. Through our Retail brokerage business, we compete with a number of insurance brokerage firms that focus on delivering services to Fortune 1000 and mediumsized companies, including large publicly traded brokers (such as Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc., Aon plc, Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company, Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. and Brown & Brown, Inc.), large privately held brokerage businesses and other small locally-owned agencies. Through our Wholesale brokerage business, we compete with a number of other wholesale brokerage firms such as Ryan Specialty Holdings, Inc. (publicly traded), Amwins Group, Inc. (privately held) and others, as well as retail brokerage firms that distribute products similar to the types of products we distribute and insurance carriers that distribute these products directly through retail producers. Through our Specialty Programs business, we compete with a variety of sources for standard and specialized insurance products with similar coverages.

1994_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.15,Our Strengths,17.15.1,Scaled Platform with Market Leading Positions Across the Insurance Distribution Chain,"We are the fifth largest insurance broker in the United States by 2022 brokerage revenue with over $50 billion in premium volume and approximately $3.5 billion of revenue in 2023. We believe that our reputation, built through more than 100 years of operating history, as well as our size and scale grant us a distinct advantage in the marketplace, enabling us to better assist our clients while deepening our engagement with insurance carriers. As we continue to pursue our goals of increasing both our market share with clients and the depth of our relationships with insurance carriers, we expect to further enhance our value proposition by providing heightened access to both constituents. We believe we provide such enhanced access through a network of more than 2,000 producers and over ----- 450 underwriters based in over 200 locations across the United States as of December 31, 2023. We also maintain over 40,000 wholesale agent relationships as of December 31, 2023. We have robust capabilities across the insurance distribution chain, which we believe make us well positioned to better serve our clients while capturing a greater proportion of commission revenues. Our key brands include McGriff Insurance (a top 15 retail broker by 2022 brokerage revenue), CRC (a top 3 P&C wholesale broker by 2022 premium volume), AmRisc (a leading property catastrophe MGA), Starwind (a leading program manager), Crump (a leading life wholesaler), BenefitMall (a leading employee benefits wholesaler) and Kensington Vanguard (an independent commercial title agency). Through these brands, we are the fifth largest broker in the United States by 2022 brokerage revenue, the largest multiline wholesale broker in the United States by 2022 premium volume and one of the largest MGA programs in the United States by 2022 premium volume.",N/A,as_expected,2024,298
1994_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.15,Our Strengths,17.15.2,Highly Diversified Business Model,"Our revenue base is highly diversified across distribution channels, lines of business, geographies, clients, end markets, producers and carriers, among other factors. Our diversification ensures limited reliance on any particular product, distribution channel, customer, or market, reducing our exposure to any adverse industry developments and macroeconomic factors and thereby mitigating volatility in our overall financial performance. In addition, the breadth of our offerings provides us with various avenues through which we can identify gaps in the market and develop specialized products to capture unmet demand. 1) P&C represents CRC, Specialty Programs and McGriff Insurance (excluding employee benefits). Employee benefits represents McGriff Insurance’s employee benefits business and BenefitMall. Life represents Crump. Title represents Kensington Vanguard. 2) Top 30 rankings exclude Lloyd’s market. Given the diversification of our business model, we are well positioned to channel premiums across several distribution channels in situations that would benefit our clients. Ultimately, this enables us to better serve our clients by providing enhanced coverage and placement for their risks while also allowing us to capture a greater proportion of economics from the value chain. In 2023, McGriff Insurance placed approximately $1 billion of premiums into CRC, 8% of CRC’s total premium. In the same year, McGriff Insurance placed approximately $54 million of premiums into Starwind, 2% of Starwind’s total premium. Similarly, CRC placed approximately $580 million of premiums with AmRisc, 23% of Amrisc’s total premium, and approximately $280 million of premiums with Starwind, 9% of Starwind’s total premium. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,298
1994_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.15,Our Strengths,17.15.3,Long-Term Track Record of Growth with Continued Secular Tailwinds,"We have a long-term track record of consistent growth. Over the last 19 years, we have demonstrated a robust growth trajectory with a 9.5% total revenue CAGR and 4.2% average annual organic growth. We have a demonstrated track record of growing organically across P&C and economic market cycles. Our average organic revenue growth was 8%, 8% and 5% over the last 3, 5 and 10 years, respectively. We benefit from the non-discretionary nature of insurance coverage and employee benefits, which we believe creates relatively stable, consistent demand for our offerings across P&C and economic market cycles. We also believe we benefit from distinct advantages in the marketplace driven by our longstanding reputation, scale, depth of relationships, client service, expertise, and product offerings. 1) Based on P&C direct premiums written. 2) Based on annual average commercial P&C rate changes. We believe that our organic revenue growth compares favorably to large, publicly traded insurance brokers with whom we compete (such as Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc., Aon plc, Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company, Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. and Brown & Brown, Inc.). Since 2018, we have generated higher ----- annual organic revenue growth compared to the median of large, publicly traded peer brokerage segments. Our average annual organic revenue growth between 2018 and 2023 was 7.3%, including our Title and Wellington businesses, and 7.8% excluding these businesses. This compares favorably to a public peer composite average of 6.8%. We believe that our outperformance is driven by our diversified business model and strong growth across our wholesale P&C and MGA businesses. 1) Represents TIH organic revenue growth excluding the Title and Wellington businesses. 2) Represents the median organic revenue growth for the brokerage segments of Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc., Aon plc, Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company, Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. and Brown & Brown, Inc. per public filings. We believe that a combination of secular tailwinds, in addition to our identified growth initiatives, will help to sustain our strong organic growth trajectory. _Market Share Growth for E&S Lines and MGAs. Insurance risks are becoming increasingly complex and_ specialized given the impacts of globalization and technological change, among other factors. As a result, E&S lines are becoming more prevalent in the United States, resulting in higher market share. In 2022, $98 billion of direct premiums written were in E&S lines, representing 11% of P&C premiums in the United States. This is nearly double the $45 billion of E&S direct written premiums in 2017, which comprised 7% of P&C premiums at the time. Similarly, utilization of MGAs is increasing as a means of efficiently underwriting and placing complex risks. Direct written premiums channeled through MGAs in the United States grew from $43 billion in 2017 to $86 billion in 2022, reflecting a growth in market share from 7% to 10% of total P&C premiums. We believe these trends have generated a sustained tailwind for our organic growth given the weighting of our product mix and distribution channels. _P&C Pricing Environment. The P&C sector is currently characterized by a hard market with a general_ upward trend in pricing. The average premium rate change for commercial P&C products was 10.6% in 2020, 9.0% in 2021, 7.5% in 2022 and 8.4% in 2023. We believe uplifts in pricing for the coverages we sell generate favorable impacts on our organic growth. _Broker Commission Rates. Broker commission rates have gradually increased over time and have_ demonstrated resilience amid the current hard market environment, reflecting the strong value proposition delivered by brokerage firms to clients and carriers. Direct commission rates for commercial P&C lines were 13.3% in 2019, 13.2% in 2020, 13.4% in 2021 and 13.6% in 2022, which compared favorably to 12.1% in 2011. We believe higher brokerage commission rates create a tailwind for our organic growth. In addition to strong organic growth, our growth has also been propelled historically by acquiring and developing key capabilities that have enhanced the scale of our platform and the depth and breadth of our offerings. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,298

Key components of our organic growth strategy include: (1) enhanced cross-sell to existing clients across all of our operations, (2) development of new programs and products given opportunities in the marketplace, and (3) producer recruitment and retention. We have a long and successful track record of attracting and retaining producer talent. Since January 2019, we have hired over 360 producers at McGriff Insurance and over 270 brokers at CRC. The McGriff Insurance producer hires generated $103 million of revenue in 2023, representing approximately 9% of McGriff Insurance’s total commissions and fees during 2023. The CRC broker hires generated $128 million of revenue in 2023, representing 10.7% of CRC’s total commissions and fees during 2023. Producer recruiting activity remained strong in 2023 following Stone Point’s minority investment and implementation of the new TIH equity incentive plan.

As of December 31, 2023, over 1,500 of our employees and producers participate in our equity incentive plan and approximately 90 key leaders and producers have invested meaningful equity amounts alongside Stone Point through our co-investment program.

In 2023, we initiated a series of expense and efficiency initiatives to streamline our operations and increase operating leverage without impacting revenue. As of December 31, 2023, we have identified $96 million of expense reductions. Of this amount, $61 million of reductions have been actioned in 2023 (or are scheduled to be actioned in the first quarter of 2024) and $7 million have been realized in 2023. Key cost saving categories include: (1) targeted reductions in force of duplicative leadership and unprofitable producers across all business units, (2) rationalization of real estate footprint and consolidation of overlapping offices, (3) tightened oversight of travel and entertainment spend, and (4) third party vendor contract optimization. Viewing the $96 million of expected expense reductions holistically, 53% relates to organizational restructuring, 21% relates to additional outsourcing, 3% relates to real estate rationalization and 23% relates to other initiatives. Additionally, we have identified an incremental $28 million of potential expense reductions, which we expect to action in 2024, including $20 million in possible savings from outsourcing or offshoring non-client facing functions, $3 million of expected additional real estate rationalization savings and approximately $5 million of potential information technology savings.

Although the scope of regulation and form of supervision may vary from state to state, insurance laws are often complex and generally grant broad discretion to supervisory authorities in adopting regulations and supervising regulated activities. These regulations are generally designed to protect our clients by establishing minimum standards of conduct and practice, particularly regarding the provision of advice and product information as well as the handling of client funds held in a fiduciary capacity. _Licensing requirements. In each state in which we do business, the relevant insurance brokerage is required_ to be licensed or to have received regulatory approval to conduct business. In addition to brokerage licensing requirements, most states in which we operate require individuals who engage in brokerage and certain insurance service activities to be licensed personally. Our operations depend on the validity of and continued good standing under the licenses and approvals pursuant to which we operate. Licensing laws and regulations vary from state to state and are subject to amendment or interpretation by regulatory authorities. Such authorities generally have the discretion to grant, renew or revoke licenses and approvals for various reasons, including the violation of regulations. In some instances, where there is uncertainty as to applicability, we follow practices based on our interpretations of regulations or practices that we believe generally to be followed by the industry. These practices may turn out to be different from the interpretations of ----- regulatory authorities. If we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, state insurance regulators could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities in their state or could otherwise penalize us.

The placement of insurance and the handling of claims involve substantial amounts of money. Since errors and omissions claims against us may allege our potential liability for all or part of the amounts in question, claimants may seek large damage awards and these claims can involve significant defense costs. Errors and omissions could include, for example, our employees or sub-agents failing, whether negligently or intentionally, to place coverage or to notify insurance carriers of claims on behalf of clients, to provide insurance carriers with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured or to appropriately apply funds that we hold for our clients on a fiduciary basis. We are also subject to litigation in circumstances where we hire producers or senior managers who are subject to confidentiality or non-solicitation agreements with our competitors. We have not recorded a liability related to any of these matters, other than for legal costs, because management is unable at the present time to make a determination that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable.

The Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the priorities and other relative rights among the holders of the Notes, the holders of the First Lien Credit Facilities Obligations and the holders of the Other Pari Passu Lien Obligations, including, among other things, that: (1) notwithstanding the date, time, method, manner or order of grant, attachment or perfection (in millions) of any Liens on the Collateral securing the Notes, the First Lien Credit Facilities Obligations and the Other Pari Passu Lien Obligations, the Liens securing all such Indebtedness shall be of equal priority; and (2) the Obligations in respect of the Notes, the First Lien Credit Facilities Obligations and the Other Pari Passu Lien Obligations may be increased, extended, renewed, replaced, restated, supplemented, restructured, refunded, refinanced or otherwise amended from time to time, in each case, to the extent permitted by the Indenture, the Credit Agreement and the documentation governing the Other Pari Passu Lien Obligations. The Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement also will provide that only the “Applicable Authorized _Representative” will have the right to direct foreclosures and take other actions with respect to the Collateral. We_ expect the First Lien Credit Facilities Collateral Agent will be the initial Applicable Authorized Representative until such time as the occurrence of a Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date (as defined below) (such date, the “Applicable Authorized Agent Change Date”). Following the Applicable Authorized Agent Change Date, the Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative (as defined below), will become the Applicable Authorized Representative. As of any date, the “Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative” is the Authorized Representative of the largest class of Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority then-outstanding (other than the same class as the class of Indebtedness represented by then Applicable Authorized Representative). The “Non-Controlling _Authorized Representative Enforcement Date” is the date that is 180 days (throughout which 180-day period the_ applicable Authorized Representative was the Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative) after the occurrence of both (a) an event of default under the terms of the class of Indebtedness represented by such Authorized Representative and (b) the Notes Collateral Agent’s and each other Authorized Representative’s receipt of written notice from that Authorized Representative certifying that (i) such Authorized Representative is the Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative and that an event of default with respect to the class of Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority represented by the Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative has occurred and is continuing and (ii) such class of Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority is currently due and payable in full (whether as a result of acceleration thereof or otherwise) in accordance with the terms of that class of Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority; provided, that such event of default under the terms of the class of Indebtedness represented by such Authorized Representative shall be continuing at the end of such 180-day period; provided, further, that the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date shall be stayed and shall not occur and shall be deemed not to have occurred with respect to any Collateral (1) at any time the Applicable Authorized Representative has commenced and is diligently pursuing any enforcement action with respect to such Collateral or (2) at any time an Issuer or any other Grantor that has granted a security interest in such Collateral is then a debtor under or with respect to (or otherwise subject to) any insolvency or liquidation proceeding. ----- (i) Only the Applicable Collateral Agent (as defined below) will and will have the right to exercise, or refrain from exercising, any rights, remedies and powers with respect to the Collateral, including any action to enforce their respective security interest in or realize upon any Collateral and any right, remedy or power with respect to any Collateral under any intercreditor agreement (other than the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement), and then only on the instructions of the Applicable Authorized Representative, (ii) the Applicable Collateral Agent shall not be required to, and shall not, follow any instructions or directions with respect to Collateral (including with respect to any intercreditor agreement with respect to any Collateral) from any Non-Controlling Secured Party, it being understood and agreed that, notwithstanding any such instruction or direction by the Applicable Authorized Representative, the Applicable Collateral Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion, could expose such collateral agent to liability or be contrary to any security document or applicable law, and (iii) no NonControlling Secured Party shall, or shall instruct the Applicable Collateral Agent to, commence any judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings with respect to, seek to have a trustee, receiver, liquidator or similar official appointed for or over, attempt any action to take possession of, take any other action to enforce its security interest in or realize upon, or exercise any other right, remedy or power with respect to (including any right, remedy or power under any intercreditor agreement other than the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement) any Collateral, whether under any credit document, applicable law or otherwise, it being agreed that only the Applicable Collateral Agent, acting on the instructions of the Applicable Authorized Representative and in accordance with the applicable security documents, shall be entitled to take any such actions or exercise any such rights, remedies and powers with respect to Collateral. Notwithstanding the equal priority of the Liens established under the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement with respect to the Collateral, the Applicable Collateral Agent (acting on the instructions of the Applicable Authorized Representative) may deal with the Collateral as if such collateral agent had a senior Lien on such Collateral. No Non-Controlling Secured Party will contest, protest or object to any foreclosure proceeding or action brought by the Applicable Collateral Agent, the Applicable Authorized Representative or any Controlling Secured Party, or any other exercise by the Applicable Collateral Agent, the Applicable Authorized Representative or any Controlling Secured Party of any rights, remedies or powers with respect to the Collateral, or seek to cause either Collateral Agent to do so. “Applicable Collateral Agent” means (i) until the earlier of (x) the discharge of First Lien Credit Facilities Obligations and (y) the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date, the First Lien Credit Facilities Collateral Agent and (ii) from and after the earlier of (x) the discharge of First Lien Credit Facilities Obligations and (y) the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date, the Additional Collateral Agent. Note that the discharge of First Lien Credit Facilities Obligations will not be deemed to have occurred in connection with a refinancing of First Lien Credit Facilities Obligations with additional Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority which has been designated in writing by the First Lien Credit Facilities Collateral Agent to the Notes Collateral Agent and each other Authorized Representative as the “Credit Agreement” for purposes of the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement. “Additional Collateral Agent” means, with respect to the Collateral (x) for so long as the Notes are the only class of additional Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority outstanding, the Notes Collateral Agent and (y) thereafter, the Collateral Agent of the same class as the Authorized Representative that is the Applicable Authorized Representative with respect to such Collateral at such time. “Controlling Secured Parties” means, at any time with respect to any Collateral, (i) at any time when the First Lien Credit Facilities Collateral Agent is the Applicable Collateral Agent, the Credit Agreement Secured Parties and (ii) at any other time, the Pari Notes Debt Secured Parties of the same class as the Authorized Representative that is the Applicable Authorized Representative with respect to such Collateral at such time. “Non-Controlling Secured Parties” means, at any time with respect to any Collateral, the Pari Notes Debt Secured Parties that are not Controlling Secured Parties at such time with respect to such Collateral. If (i) an event of default has occurred and is continuing under any Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority, and any Authorized Representative or Pari Notes Debt Secured Party is taking action to enforce rights in respect of any Collateral, (ii) any distribution is made with respect to any Collateral in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding of an Issuer or any other Grantor (including any adequate protection payments) or (iii) any Authorized Representative or Pari Notes Debt Secured Party receives any payment with respect to any Collateral pursuant to any intercreditor agreement (other than the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement), the proceeds of any sale, collection ----- or other liquidation of any such Collateral by any Authorized Representative or Pari Notes Debt Secured Party on account of such enforcement of rights or exercise of remedies, and any such distributions or payments received by Authorized Representative or Pari Notes Debt Secured Party, will be applied (i) first, to payment of all amounts owing to the Notes Collateral Agent, the First Lien Credit Facilities Collateral Agent, any other collateral agent with respect to Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority and the other Authorized Representatives, in their capacities as such, (ii) second, among the Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority to the payment in full of all such Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority on a ratable basis; provided that following the commencement of any insolvency or liquidation proceeding of an Issuer or any other Grantor, solely as among the secured parties and solely for purposes of this clause and not any Notes Documents or any other document governing any other Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority, in the event the value of the Collateral is not sufficient for the entire amount of post-petition interest, fees and expenses to be allowed under the Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable bankruptcy law in such insolvency or liquidation proceeding, the amount of such Indebtedness shall include only the maximum amount of post-petition interest, fees and expenses on such Indebtedness allowable under the applicable bankruptcy law in such insolvency or liquidation proceeding, and (iii) third, to the Issuers and the other Grantors or their successors or assigns, as their interests may appear, or to whosoever may be lawfully entitled to receive the same, or as a court of competent jurisdiction may direct. None of the holders of Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority may institute any suit or assert in any suit, insolvency or liquidation proceeding or other proceeding any claim against the Notes Collateral Agent, any other collateral agent with respect to Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority or any other holder of Other Pari Passu Lien Obligations seeking damages from or other relief by way of specific performance, instructions or otherwise with respect to any Collateral. In addition, none of the holders of Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority may seek to have any Collateral or any part thereof marshaled upon any foreclosure or other disposition of such Collateral. If any holder of Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority obtains possession of any Collateral or realizes any proceeds or payment in respect thereof, in each case, as a result of the enforcement of remedies, at any time prior to the discharge of each of such Indebtedness, then it must hold such Collateral, proceeds or payment in trust for the other holders of Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority and promptly transfer such Collateral, proceeds or payment to the Applicable Authorized Representative to be distributed in accordance with the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement. The Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the holders of Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority of each class (and not the holders of Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority of any other class) bear the risk of (a) any determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that (i) any Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority of such class is unenforceable under applicable Law or is subordinated to any other obligations (other than to any Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority of any other class), (ii) any Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority of such class does not have a valid and perfected Lien on any of the Collateral securing any Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority of any other class and/or (iii) any intervening security interest exists securing any other obligations (other than Other Pari Passu Lien Obligations) on a basis ranking prior to the security interest of such class of Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority but junior to the security interest of any other class of Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority, or (b) the existence of any Collateral securing Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority of any other class that does not constitute Collateral with respect to Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority of such class (any condition referred to in clause (a) or (b) with respect to Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority of such class being referred to as an “Impairment” of such class). In the event an Impairment exists with respect to Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority of any class, the results of such Impairment shall be borne solely by the holders of Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority of such class, and the rights of such holders (including the right to receive distributions in accordance with the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement) shall be modified to the extent necessary so that the results of such Impairment are borne solely by such holders. The Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement provides that it shall continue in full force and effect notwithstanding the commencement and continuance of any insolvency or liquidation proceeding by or against an Issuer or any of its subsidiaries. The relative rights as to the Collateral and proceeds thereof shall continue after the commencement of any insolvency or liquidation proceeding on the same basis as prior to the date of the petition therefor. All references in the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement to an Issuer or any Guarantor shall include such Issuer or Guarantor as a debtor-in-possession and any receiver or trustee for such Issuer or Guarantor. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,298

See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the Notes—In a bankruptcy proceeding, the holders of notes might not be able to apply the Escrowed Property to repay the notes without bankruptcy court approval.” If at any time the Escrow Account contains cash having an aggregate value in excess of the Special Mandatory Redemption Price on the Escrow Outside Date, such excess funds may be released to the Escrow Issuers at the option of the Escrow Issuers, after payment of fees and expenses of the Trustee and Escrow Agent, if any. Upon the acceleration of the maturity of the Notes or the failure to pay principal at maturity or upon certain redemptions and repurchases of the Notes, the Escrow Agreement will provide for the foreclosure by the Trustee upon the funds held in the Escrow Account. In the event of such a foreclosure, the proceeds of the Escrow Account will be applied, first, to amounts owing to the Trustee and Escrow Agent in respect of fees, expenses and other amounts payable to the ----- Trustee and Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement and the Indenture, second, to the holders of the Notes to the full extent of all Obligations under the Indenture and the Notes and, third, any remainder to the Escrow Issuers or their estates.

Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Issuers will send notice of such Change of Control Offer by electronic delivery in accordance with the procedures of DTC or first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee and the paying agent, to each Holder of Notes to the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with DTC’s applicable procedures, with the following information: (1) that a Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to this covenant, and that all Notes properly tendered pursuant to such Change of Control Offer will be accepted for payment by the Issuers; (2) the purchase price and the purchase date, which will be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered except in the case of a conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control as described below (the “Change of Control Payment Date”); (3) that any Note not properly tendered will remain outstanding and continue to accrue interest; (4) that unless the Issuers default in the payment of the Change of Control Payment, all Notes accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest on the Change of Control Payment Date; (5) that Holders will be entitled to withdraw their tendered Notes and their election to require the Issuers to purchase such Notes; provided that the paying agent receives, not later than the close of business on the second Business Day prior to the expiration date of the Change of Control Offer, a facsimile transmission, electronic transmission or letter setting forth the name of the Holder of the Notes, the principal amount of Notes tendered for purchase, and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing its tendered Notes and its election to have such Notes purchased; (6) that Holders whose Notes are being purchased only in part will be issued new Notes and such new Notes will be equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered. The unpurchased portion of the Notes must be equal to at least $2,000 or any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof; (7) if such notice is delivered prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control and describing each such condition; and (8) the other instructions, as determined by the Issuers, consistent with the covenant described hereunder, that a Holder must follow. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture and the Issuers comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations, then the Issuers shall not be deemed to have breached their obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. ----- On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuers will, to the extent permitted by law, (1) accept for payment all Notes issued by it or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (2) deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the aggregate Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions thereof so tendered; and (3) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee for cancellation the Notes so accepted together with an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee stating that such Notes or portions thereof have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuers. The Senior Credit Facilities will, and future credit agreements or other agreements relating to Indebtedness to which ParentCo becomes a party may, provide that certain change of control events with respect to ParentCo would constitute a default thereunder (including a Change of Control). If we experience a change of control that triggers a default under the Senior Credit Facilities or such other indebtedness, we could seek a waiver of such default or seek to refinance the Senior Credit Facilities or such other indebtedness. In the event we do not obtain such a waiver or refinance the Senior Credit Facilities or such other indebtedness, such default could result in amounts outstanding under the Senior Credit Facilities or such other indebtedness being declared due and payable. Our ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by our then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the Notes—We may not be able to finance a change of control offer or asset sale offer required by the indenture that will govern the notes.” The Change of Control purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the Initial Purchasers and us. After the Completion Date, we have no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control, although it is possible that we could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, we could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenant described under the caption “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” and “Certain Covenants—Liens.” Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders of the Notes protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. The Issuers will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuers and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of making of the Change of Control Offer. The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of ParentCo and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any Person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of ParentCo and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder of Notes may require the Issuers to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. ----- The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuers’ obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control, including the definition of Change of Control and Change of Control, may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.",N/A,as_expected,2024,298

If the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value in the case of other Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable) of Notes or the Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by such holders thereof exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Issuers shall select the Notes (while the Notes are in global form pursuant to the procedures of DTC) and such Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis based on the accreted value or aggregate principal amount of the Notes or such Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered; provided that no Notes will be selected and purchased in an unauthorized denomination. Upon completion of any such Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) will be reset to zero. An Asset Sale Offer may be made at the same time as consents are solicited with respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture, Notes and/or Guarantees.

----- (20) redemptions in whole or in part of any of their Equity Interests for another class of its Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) or with proceeds from substantially concurrent equity contributions or issuances of new Equity Interests; (21) payments to ParentCo or payments or distributions to direct and indirect parent companies of ParentCo to permit such Person to (a) pay cash in lieu of fractional Equity Interests in connection with any dividend, split or combination thereof or any Investment not prohibited under the Indenture and (b) honor any conversion request by a holder of convertible Indebtedness and make cash payments in lieu of fractional shares in connection with any such conversion and may make payments on convertible Indebtedness in accordance with its terms; (22) payments or distributions to satisfy dissenters’ or appraisal rights, and the settlement of any claims or actions (whether actual, contingent or potential) with respect thereto, pursuant to or in connection with (i) any acquisition of assets (including Capital Stock), business or Person, or any merger or consolidation of any Person with or into ParentCo or any Restricted Subsidiary, or any other Investment or (ii) a consolidation, merger or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of ParentCo and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, that complies with the covenant described under the caption “—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets”; (23) the conversion of any Subordinated Indebtedness to Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of ParentCo or any of its direct or indirect parent companies, and any payment that is intended to prevent any Subordinated Indebtedness from being treated as an “applicable high yield discount obligation” within the meaning of Section 163(i)(1) of the Code; (24) mandatory redemptions of Disqualified Stock issued as a Restricted Payment or as consideration for a Permitted Investment; and (25) any Restricted Payment made in connection with a Permitted Intercompany Activity or Permitted Tax Restructuring. For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that a proposed Restricted Payment (or a portion thereof) meets the criteria of clauses (1) through (25) above or is entitled to be made pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant and/or one or more of the clauses contained in the definition of “Permitted Investments,” ParentCo will be entitled to classify or later reclassify (based on circumstances existing on the date of such reclassification) such Restricted Payment or Investment (or portion thereof) between such clauses (1) through (25) and such first paragraph and/or one or more of the clauses contained in the definition of “Permitted Investments,” in a manner that otherwise complies with this covenant. We anticipate that, as of the Completion Date, all of ParentCo’s Subsidiaries will be Restricted Subsidiaries. ParentCo will not permit any Unrestricted Subsidiary to become a Restricted Subsidiary except pursuant to the last sentence of the definition of “Unrestricted Subsidiary.” For purposes of designating any Restricted Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, all outstanding Investments by ParentCo and its Restricted Subsidiaries (except to the extent repaid) in the Subsidiary so designated will be deemed to be Restricted Payments in an amount determined as set forth in the last sentence of the definition of “Investment.” If such Subsidiary so designated has consolidated assets greater than $1,000, then such designation will be permitted only if a Restricted Payment and/or Permitted Investment in such amount would be permitted at such time, and if such Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary. Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants set forth in the Indenture. The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) shall be the fair market value on the date of such Restricted Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be paid, transferred or issued by ParentCo or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to such Restricted Payment. The fair market value of any cash Restricted Payment shall be its face amount, and the fair market value of any non-cash Restricted Payment, property or assets other than cash shall be determined conclusively by ParentCo acting in good faith. ----- Unrestricted Subsidiaries may use value transferred from ParentCo and its Restricted Subsidiaries in a Permitted Investment to purchase or otherwise acquire Indebtedness or Equity Interests of ParentCo, any director or indirect parent of ParentCo or any of ParentCo’s Restricted Subsidiaries, and to transfer value to the holders of the Equity Interests or any director or indirect parent of ParentCo and to Affiliates thereof. In connection with any commitment, definitive agreement or similar event relating to an Investment, ParentCo or applicable Restricted Subsidiary may designate such Investment as having occurred on the date of the commitment, definitive agreement or similar event relating thereto (such date, the “Election Date”) if, after giving Pro Forma Effect to such Investment and all related transactions in connection therewith and any related Pro Forma Adjustments, ParentCo or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been permitted to make such Investment on the relevant Election Date in compliance with the Indenture, and any related subsequent actual making of such Investment will be deemed for all purposes under the Indenture to have been made on such Election Date, including for purposes of the calculation of any ratio, compliance with any test, usage of any baskets hereunder (if applicable) and the calculation of Consolidated EBITDA and for purposes of determining whether there exists any Default or Event of Default (and all such calculations on and after the Election Date until the termination, expiration, passing, rescission, retraction or rescindment of such commitment, definitive agreement or similar event shall be made on a Pro Forma Basis giving effect thereto and all related transactions in connection therewith). If ParentCo or a Restricted Subsidiary makes a Restricted Payment which at the time of the making of such Restricted Payment would in the good faith determination of ParentCo not be prohibited under the provisions of the Indenture, such Restricted Payment shall be deemed to have been made in compliance with the Indenture notwithstanding any subsequent adjustments made in good faith to ParentCo’s financial statements affecting Consolidated Net Income or Consolidated EBITDA of ParentCo for any period.",N/A,as_expected,2024,298

For the avoidance of doubt, if ParentCo has made an LCT Election, (1) if any of the ratios, tests or baskets for which compliance was determined or tested as of the LCT Test Date would at any time after the LCT Test Date have been exceeded or otherwise failed to have been complied with as a result of fluctuations in any such ratio, test or basket, including due to fluctuations in Consolidated EBITDA or Total Assets of ParentCo or the Person subject to such Limited Condition Transaction, such baskets, tests or ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded or failed to have been complied with as a result of such fluctuations; (2) if any related requirements and conditions (including as to the absence of any continuing Default or Event of Default) for which compliance or satisfaction was determined or tested as of the LCT Test Date would at any time after the LCT Test Date not have been complied with or satisfied (including due to the occurrence or continuation of an Default or Event of Default), such requirements and conditions will not be deemed to have been failed to be complied with or satisfied (and such Default or Event of Default shall be deemed not to have occurred or be continuing); and (3) in calculating the availability under any ratio, test or basket in connection with any action or transaction unrelated to such Limited Condition Transaction following the relevant LCT Test Date and prior to the earlier of the date on which such Limited Condition Transaction is consummated or the date that the definitive agreement or date for redemption, purchase or repayment specified in an irrevocable notice for such Limited Condition Transaction is terminated, expires or passes (or, if applicable, the irrevocable notice is terminated, expires or passes or, as applicable, the offer in respect of an LCT Public Offer for, such acquisition is terminated), as applicable, without consummation of such Limited Condition Transaction, any such ratio, test or basket shall be determined or tested giving Pro Forma Effect to such Limited Condition Transaction.",N/A,as_expected,2024,298

(4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there is issued or by which there is secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by ParentCo or any Significant Subsidiary or the payment of which is guaranteed by ParentCo or any Significant Subsidiary, other than Indebtedness owed to ParentCo or any Significant Subsidiary, whether such Indebtedness or guarantee now exists or is created after the issuance of the Notes, if both: (a) such default either results from the failure to pay any principal of such Indebtedness at its stated final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) or relates to an obligation other than the obligation to pay principal of any such Indebtedness at its stated final maturity and results in the holder or holders of such Indebtedness causing such Indebtedness to become due prior to its stated maturity; and ----- (b) the principal amount of such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other such Indebtedness in default for failure to pay principal at stated final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods), or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregate in excess of the greater of (I) $426.16 million and (II) 35% of Consolidated EBITDA for the most recently ended Test Period as of such date, calculated on a Pro Forma Basis; _provided that no Default or Event of Default will be deemed to occur with respect to any such Indebtedness_ that is paid or otherwise acquired or retired (or for which such failure to pay or acceleration is waived or rescinded) within 20 Business Days after such failure to pay or such acceleration; (5) failure by ParentCo or any Significant Subsidiary (or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that together (determined as of the most recent consolidated financial statements of ParentCo for a fiscal quarter end provided as required by the covenant described under the caption “— Reports and Other Information”) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) to pay final non-appealable judgments aggregating in excess of the greater of (x) $412.16 million and (y) 35% of Consolidated EBITDA for the most recently ended Test Period as of such date, calculated on a Pro Forma Basis (in each case, net of amounts covered by insurance policies issued by reputable insurance companies), which final judgments remain unpaid, undischarged and unstayed for a period of more than 90 days after such judgment becomes final, and in the event such judgment is covered by insurance, an enforcement proceeding has been commenced by any creditor upon such judgment or decree which is not promptly stayed; (6) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to Holdings, any Intermediate Parent, ParentCo, any Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary (or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that together (determined as of the most recent consolidated financial statements of ParentCo for a fiscal quarter end provided as required by the covenant described under the caption “—Reports and Other Information”) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary); (7) the Guarantee of any Significant Subsidiary shall for any reason cease to be in full force and effect or be declared null and void or any Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary (or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that together (as of the most recent consolidated financial statement of ParentCo for a fiscal quarter end) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary), as the case may be, denies in writing that it has any further liability under its Guarantee or gives written notice to such effect, other than by reason of the termination of the Indenture or the release of any such Guarantee in accordance with the Indenture;

provided, that if a failure of the sort described in this clause (8) is susceptible of cure (including with respect to any loss of Lien priority on material portions of the Collateral), no Event of Default shall arise under this clause (8) with respect thereto until 60 days after notice of such failure shall have been given to the Issuers by the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes issued under the Indenture; or (9) failure by the Issuers to consummate the Special mandatory Redemption as described under “—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.” ----- However, a Default under clause (3), (4) or (5) of the immediately preceding paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the then total outstanding Notes notify the Issuers of the Default and, with respect to clauses (3) and (5), the Issuers do not cure such Default within the time specified in clauses (3) and (5) of this paragraph after receipt of such notice. Any notice of Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of Default, notice of acceleration or take any other action (a “Noteholder Direction”) provided by any one or more Holders (each a “Directing Holder”) must be accompanied by a written representation from each such Holder delivered to the Issuers and the Trustee that such Holder is not (or, in the case such Holder is DTC or its nominee, that such Holder is being instructed solely by beneficial owners that are not) Net Short (a “Position Representation”), which representation, in the case of a Noteholder Direction relating to the delivery of a notice of Default shall be deemed a continuing representation until the resulting Event of Default is cured or otherwise ceases to exist or the Notes are accelerated. In addition, each Directing Holder is deemed, at the time of providing a Noteholder Direction, to covenant to provide the Issuers with such other information as the Issuers may reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such Noteholder’s Position Representation within five Business Days of request therefor (a “Verification _Covenant”). In any case in which the Holder is DTC or its nominee, any Position Representation or Verification_ Covenant required hereunder shall be provided by the beneficial owner of the Notes in lieu of DTC or its nominee and DTC shall be entitled to conclusively rely on such Position Representation and Verification Covenant in delivering its direction to the Trustee. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Issuers determine in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was, at any relevant time, in breach of its Position Representation and provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that the Issuers have initiated litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction seeking a determination that such Directing Holder was, at such time, in breach of its Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Default, Event of Default or acceleration (or notice thereof) that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect to such Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to such Default or Event of Default shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending a final and non-appealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction on such matter. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Issuers provide to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that a Directing Holder failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant, the cure period with respect to such Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to any Default or Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending satisfaction of such Verification Covenant. Any breach of the Position Representation shall result in such Holder’s participation in such Noteholder Direction being disregarded; and, if, without the participation of such Holder, the percentage of Notes held by the remaining Holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio, with the effect that such Default or Event of Default shall be deemed never to have occurred, acceleration voided and the Trustee shall be deemed not to have received such Noteholder Direction or any notice of such Default or Event of Default. Notwithstanding anything in the preceding two paragraphs to the contrary, any Noteholder Direction delivered to the Trustee during the pendency of an Event of Default as the result of a bankruptcy or similar proceeding shall not require compliance with the foregoing paragraphs. For the avoidance of doubt, the Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any Noteholder Direction delivered to it in accordance with the Indenture, shall have no duty to inquire as to or investigate the accuracy of any Position Representation, enforce compliance with any Verification Covenant, verify any statements in any Officer’s Certificate delivered to it or otherwise make calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to Derivative Instruments, Net Shorts, Long Derivative Instruments, Short Derivative Instruments or otherwise. The Trustee shall have no liability or responsibility to the Issuers, any Holder or any other Person in acting in good faith on a Noteholder Direction or to determine whether or not any Holder has delivered a Position Representation or that such Position Representation conforms with the Indenture or any other agreement. If any Event of Default (other than of a type specified in clause (6) above) occurs and is continuing under the Indenture, the Trustee by written notice to the Issuers or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the then total outstanding Notes by written notice to the Issuers and the Trustee may declare the principal, premium, if any, interest and any other monetary obligations on all the then outstanding Notes to be due and payable ----- immediately; provided that a notice of Default may not be given with respect to any action taken, and reported publicly or to Holders, more than two years prior to such notice of Default; provided, further, that such two-year limitation shall not apply if the Trustee has commenced any remedial action in respect of any such Default. Any time period to cure any actual or alleged Default or Event of Default may be extended or stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction. Upon the effectiveness of such declaration, such principal and interest will be due and payable immediately. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an Event of Default arising under clause (6) of the first paragraph of this section, all outstanding Notes will become due and payable without further action or notice. The Indenture will provide that the Trustee may withhold from the Holders notice of any continuing Default, except a Default relating to the payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest, if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest. In addition, the Trustee shall have no obligation to accelerate the Notes. The Indenture provides that the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes by written notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes waive any existing Default and its consequences under the Indenture (except a continuing Default in the payment of interest on, premium, if any, or the principal of any Note held by a non-consenting Holder) and rescind any acceleration with respect to the Notes and its consequences, provided such rescission would not conflict with any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. In the event of any Event of Default specified in clause (4) above, such Event of Default and all consequences thereof (excluding any resulting payment default, other than as a result of acceleration of the Notes) shall be annulled, waived and rescinded, automatically and without any action by the Trustee or the Holders, if within 20 days after such Event of Default arose: (1) the Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been discharged; or (2) holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action (as the case may be) giving rise to such Event of Default; or (3) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured. In case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent will be under any obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders of the Notes unless the Holders have offered, and if requested, provided to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent indemnity or security satisfactory to the Trustee and Notes Collateral Agent, as the case may be, against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest when due, no Holder of a Note may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless: (1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing; (2) Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the total outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) Holders of the Notes have offered and, if requested, provide to the Trustee indemnity or security reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt thereof and the offer of security or indemnity; and (5) Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the total outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such request within such 60 -day period. ----- Subject to certain restrictions, under the Indenture the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the total outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder of a Note or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability (it being understood that the Trustee has no duty to determine whether any such action is prejudicial to any Holder or beneficial owner of the Notes). The Indenture will provide that the Issuers are required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding compliance with the Indenture, and the Issuers are required, within 30 Business Days, upon becoming aware of any Default or Event of Default, to deliver to the Trustee a statement specifying such Default or Event of Default, its status and what actions the Issuers are taking or proposes to take with respect thereto. The Trustee will not be deemed to have knowledge of any Defaults or Events of Default unless written notice of an event, which is in fact a Default or Event of Default, has been delivered to the Trustee at its office specified in the Indenture and such notice references the Notes and the Indenture and states that it is a “Notice of Default.”",N/A,as_expected,2024,298

1994_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,239,"BOOK ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM",239.1,Depository Procedures,239.1.1,,"The following description of the operations and procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream is provided solely as a matter of convenience. These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the respective settlement systems and are subject to changes by them. None of the issuers, the Trustee, the Registrar or the Paying Agent take any responsibility for these operations and procedures and urge investors to contact the system or their participants directly to discuss these matters. DTC has advised us that DTC is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of New York, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the Uniform Commercial Code and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC was created to hold securities for its participating organizations (collectively, the “Participants”) and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of transactions in those securities between the Participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of its Participants. The Participants include securities brokers and dealers (including the initial purchasers), ----- banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access to DTC’s system is also available to other entities such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Participant, either directly or indirectly (collectively, the “Indirect Participants”). Persons who are not Participants may beneficially own securities held by or on behalf of DTC only through the Participants or the Indirect Participants. The ownership interests in, and transfers of ownership interests in, each security held by or on behalf of DTC are recorded on the records of the Participants and Indirect Participants. DTC has also advised us that, pursuant to procedures established by it: (1) upon deposit of the Rule 144A Global Notes and the Regulation S Global Notes, DTC will credit the accounts of Participants designated by the initial purchasers with portions of the principal amount of the Rule 144A Global Notes and the Regulation S Global Notes; and (2) ownership of these interests in Global Notes will be shown on, and the transfer of ownership of these interests will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to the Participants) or by the Participants and the Indirect Participants (with respect to other owners of beneficial interests in Global Notes). Investors in Rule 144A Global Notes who are Participants in DTC’s system may hold their interests therein directly through DTC. Investors in Rule 144A Global Notes who are not Participants may hold their interests therein indirectly through organizations (including Euroclear and Clearstream) that are Participants in DTC. All interests in a Global Note may be subject to the procedures and requirements of DTC. Investors in Regulation S Global Notes must initially hold their interests therein through Euroclear or Clearstream, if they are participants in those systems, or indirectly through organizations that are participants. After the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period (but not earlier), investors may also hold interests in Regulation S Global Notes through Participants in the DTC system other than Euroclear and Clearstream. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in Regulation S Global Notes on behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective depositories, which are Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V., as operator of Euroclear, and Citibank, N.A., as operator of Clearstream, which in turn hold such interests in customers’ securities accounts in the depositaries’ names on the books of DTC. Interests in a Global Note held through Euroclear or Clearstream may be subject to the procedures and requirements of those systems (as well as to the procedures and requirements of DTC). The laws of some states require that certain persons take physical delivery in definitive form of securities that they own and the ability to transfer beneficial interests in a Global Note to Persons that are subject to those requirements will be limited to that extent. Because DTC can act only on behalf of Participants, which in turn act on behalf of Indirect Participants, the ability of a person having beneficial interests in a Global Note to pledge those interests to Persons that do not participate in the DTC system, or otherwise take actions in respect of those interests, may be affected by the lack of a physical certificate evidencing those interests. Except as described below, owners of an interest in Global Notes will not have notes registered in their names, will not receive physical delivery of definitive notes in registered certificated form (“Certificated Notes”) and will not be considered the registered owners or “Holders” thereof under the indenture for any purpose. Payments in respect of the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on a Global Note registered in the name of DTC or its nominee will be payable to DTC in its capacity as the registered Holder under the indenture. Under the terms of the indenture, the issuers, the Registrar, the Paying Agent and the Trustee will treat the Persons in whose names notes, including Global Notes, are registered as the owners of such notes for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, none of the issuers, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Paying Agent or any agent of the issuers or the Trustee, the Registrar, the Paying Agent has or will have any responsibility or liability for: (1) any aspect of DTC’s records or any Participant’s or Indirect Participant’s records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in Global Notes or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any of DTC’s records or any Participant’s or Indirect Participant’s records relating to the beneficial ownership interests in Global Notes; or ----- (2) any other matter relating to the actions and practices of DTC or any of its Participants or Indirect Participants. DTC has advised us that its current practice, upon receipt of any payment in respect of securities such as the notes (including principal and interest), is to credit the accounts of the relevant Participants with the payment on the payment date unless DTC has reason to believe it will not receive payment on that payment date. Each relevant Participant is credited with an amount proportionate to its beneficial ownership of an interest in the principal amount of the relevant security as shown on the records of DTC. Payments by the Participants and the Indirect Participants to the beneficial owners of notes will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices and will be the responsibility of the Participants or the Indirect Participants and will not be the responsibility of DTC, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Paying Agent or the issuers. None of the issuers, the Registrar, the Paying Agent or the Trustee will be liable for any delay by DTC or any of its Participants in identifying the beneficial owners of any notes, and the issuers and the Trustee, the Registrar and the Paying Agent may conclusively rely on and will be protected in relying on instructions from DTC or its nominee for all purposes. Subject to the transfer restrictions set forth under “Transfer Restrictions,” transfers between Participants in DTC will be effected in accordance with DTC’s procedures, and will be settled in same-day funds and transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in accordance with their respective rules and operating procedures. Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the notes described herein, cross-market transfers between the Participants, on the one hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream participants, on the other hand, will be effected through DTC in accordance with DTC’s rules on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by their respective depositaries; however, such cross-market transactions will require delivery of instructions to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by the counterparty in such system in accordance with the rules and procedures and within the established deadlines (Brussels time) of such system. Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, will, if the transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to its respective depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving interests in the relevant Global Note from DTC, and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for sameday funds settlement applicable to DTC. Euroclear participants and Clearstream participants may not deliver instructions directly to the depositories for Euroclear or Clearstream. DTC has advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a Holder of notes only at the direction of one or more Participants to whose account DTC has credited the interests in the Global Notes and only in respect of the portion of the aggregate principal amount of the notes as to which that Participant or those Participants has or have given the relevant direction. However, if there is an Event of Default under the notes, DTC reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for legended notes in certificated form, and to distribute those notes to its Participants. Although DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests in Global Notes among Participants, they are under no obligation to perform those procedures, and may discontinue or change those procedures at any time. None of the issuers, the Registrar, the Paying Agent or the Trustee nor any of their respective agents will have any responsibility for the performance by DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or their respective Participants or Indirect Participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,298

Transfers involving exchanges of beneficial interests between a Regulation S Global Note and a Rule 144A Global Note will be effected in DTC by means of an instruction originated by the DTC Participant through the DTC Deposit/Withdraw at Custodian system. Accordingly, in connection with any such transfer, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect the changes in the principal amounts of the Regulation S Global Note and the Rule 144A Global Note, as applicable. Any beneficial interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a Person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in the other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be an interest in the original Global Note and will become an interest in the other Global Note and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions and other procedures applicable to beneficial interest in the other Global Note.",N/A,as_expected,2024,298

Prospective investors that are considering the purchase of notes should consult their own tax advisors concerning the particular U.S. federal income tax consequences to them of the purchase, ownership and disposition of notes, as well as the consequences to them arising under any other U.S. federal tax laws or the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction or under any applicable treaty. Certain Contingent Payments",3316.1.1,,"In certain circumstances (see, e.g., “Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption,” “Description of the Notes—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change of Control”), we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of the stated interest or principal on the notes. The requirement to make any such payments may implicate the provisions of the Treasury regulations governing contingent payment debt instruments (“CPDIs”). However, according to the applicable Treasury regulations, certain contingencies (e.g., contingencies that are, in the aggregate and as of the date of issuance, “remote” or “incidental”) will not cause a debt instrument to be treated as a CPDI. Although the matter is not free from doubt, we intend to take the position that, as of the date of issuance, the foregoing contingencies should not cause the notes to be treated as CPDIs. ----- Our determination that the notes are not CPDIs is binding on a holder, unless such holder expressly discloses its contrary position in the manner required by applicable Treasury regulations. Our determination is not, however, binding on the IRS. If the IRS were to successfully challenge our determination, a holder subject to U.S. federal income taxation may be required to accrue interest income on the notes at a higher rate than the stated rate of interest on the notes, and to treat any gain recognized on the taxable disposition of a note as ordinary income rather than as a capital gain.

In addition, from and after the consummation of the Acquisition and following the satisfaction of the Escrow Conditions (if applicable), McGriff Insurance will become a co-obligor on the notes and the notes will become fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior secured basis by Holdings, ParentCo, ParentCo’s existing wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries that guarantee the issuers’ obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities (other than Panther Co-Issuer, which will be a guarantor under the Senior Credit Facilities and a co-issuer of the notes) and any future wholly-owned domestic subsidiary of Holdings of which ParentCo is a subsidiary that guarantees the obligations of the issuers under the Senior Credit Facilities. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, a modification of a debt instrument may under certain circumstances be treated as an exchange of the debt instrument for a new debt instrument. In general, the modification is considered to be a taxable exchange when, taking into account all modifications to the debt instrument collectively, the legal rights or obligations that are altered, and the degree to which they are altered, are economically significant (a “significant modification”). Although the matter is not free from doubt, we intend to take the position, and the remainder of this disclosure assumes, that under the applicable Treasury regulations, the change in obligor, the addition of an additional co-obligor and the change in security and credit enhancement, should not constitute a significant modification of the notes. Accordingly, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a holder of notes should not recognize income, gain or loss with respect to the notes as a result of the Escrow Sub Merger, and should have the same adjusted basis and holding period in the notes as before the Escrow Sub Merger. We cannot provide assurance, however, that the IRS will not reach a different conclusion.

This summary deals only with notes that are held as “capital assets” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), by a holder that acquires the notes at their initial issue price (i.e., the first price at which a substantial amount of the notes is sold to investors for cash, excluding sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers). This summary is based upon provisions of the Code, U.S. Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, published administrative guidance of the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”), judicial decisions and other applicable authorities, all as in effect as of the date hereof. All of these authorities may be changed or subject to differing interpretations, possibly with retroactive effect, so as to result in U.S. federal income tax consequences different from those summarized below. We have not sought, and do not expect to seek, any ruling from the IRS with respect to the statements made or the conclusions reached in this summary, and there can be no assurance that the IRS or a court will agree with those statements or conclusions or that a court would not sustain any challenge by the IRS in the event of litigation. Moreover, this summary does not address any U.S. federal tax considerations other than income tax considerations (including estate or gift tax considerations), state, local, or non-U.S. tax considerations or considerations under any applicable tax treaty. In addition, this summary is general in nature and does not purport to be a complete description of the U.S. federal income tax considerations that may be relevant to holders in light of their personal circumstances or status or to holders subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws (including, without limitation, former citizens or residents of the United States; regulated investment companies; real estate investment trusts; insurance companies; entities treated as partnerships or other passthrough entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or investors therein); banks or other financial institutions; tax-exempt entities; persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income with respect to the notes being taken into account in an “applicable financial statement,” as defined in Section 451 of the Code; corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax; U.S. Holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar; S corporations; dealers in securities or currencies; traders in securities or currencies that elect to use the mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities holdings; persons holding notes as part of a “straddle,” conversion transaction, integrated transaction, constructive sale transaction, hedge or hedging transaction; persons purchasing or selling notes as part of a wash sale for tax purposes; or entities subject to any of the anti-inversion rules). If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds notes, the tax treatment of a partner in such entity or arrangement generally will depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partner and the partnership.

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, 214 North Tryon Street, Suite 4200, Charlotte, North Carolina 28202 T: (704) 344 7500, www.pwc.com/us ----- In performing an audit in accordance with US GAAS, we: - Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. - Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. - Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed. - Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. - Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal control-related matters that we identified during the audit.

Organization and Business Description Business Description Truist Insurance Holdings, LLC (“TIH LLC” or the “Company”) is a subsidiary of Truist Financial Corporation (“TFC” or the “Parent”) and is a leading insurance agency / brokerage network in the United States and globally, providing property and casualty, employee benefits, life, and title insurance to businesses and individuals. The Company operates as an agent or broker, and therefore, does not assume underwriting risks. In February 2023, Truist Insurance Holdings, Inc. (“TIH Inc.”) was converted into a Delaware Limited Liability Company (the “Partnership Conversion”) named Truist Insurance Holdings, LLC. As a result, the capital stock of TIH Inc. was converted into Common Units of TIH LLC. After the Partnership Conversion, the Company’s operations were conducted through TIH LLC, which is overseen by a Board of Managers. TIH Inc. and TIH LLC are referred to as “TIH” throughout the remainder of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Subsequent to the Partnership Conversion, on April 3, 2023, TIH recapitalized a portion of its Common Units into Preferred Units and Class W Units. Refer to Note 9. Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Units and Note 12. Members' Equity for additional information about the Preferred Units and Class W Units, respectively. Historically, the Company’s operations have been included in TFC’s U.S. federal consolidated tax return, certain foreign tax returns, and certain state tax returns. Pursuant to the Partnership Conversion, the Company has shifted from corporate taxation to pass-through taxation. Given the change in the Company's tax status, the comparative financial statements for prior periods are the financial statements of TIH Inc. TIH consists of three operating segments: Retail, Wholesale, and Services. The Retail segment provides policy placement services directly to the insured, serving as an intermediary between insurance carriers or wholesale agents and the underlying commercial and individual insureds. In addition to policy placement services, the Retail segment provides risk management and other ancillary services, such as employee benefits administration. The Wholesale segment provides policy placement services to insurance carriers and retail agents, marketing and selling excess and surplus commercial and personal line insurance products through independent agents and brokers. In some cases, the Wholesale segment also provides post-placement administrative and claims management services. The Services segment provides policy placement services (specific to title insurance), as well as services associated with the execution of real estate transactions. In December 2023, the Company announced plans to reorganize the internal reporting of its existing Wholesale operating segment. Refer to Note 18. Subsequent Events for more information. The Company is headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina. Basis of Presentation The Consolidated Financial Statements have been presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) and have been derived from the Company's accounting records, inclusive of certain allocations of assets, liabilities and overhead costs of the Parent. These financial statements have been ----- ###### prepared on a consolidated basis, inclusive of the legal entities that historically comprised the TIH business. Throughout the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, TIH operated as part of TFC. These Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on a carve-out basis. The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements are presented on a stand-alone basis as if the operations of TIH had been conducted independently from TFC, and reflect assumptions, estimates, and allocations made by the Parent to depict TIH on that basis. Accordingly, the Consolidated Financial Statements may not be indicative of the results of TIH had it been a separate stand-alone entity during the periods presented, nor are the results stated herein indicative of what the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows may be in the future. The Consolidated Statements of Operations include all revenues and expenses directly attributable to TIH, as well as an allocation of expenses from the Parent for certain support functions provided on a centralized basis related to corporate functions, including finance, enterprise risk, legal, enterprise technology, and other functional activities. The expenses incurred by the Parent for the benefit of TIH have been allocated on a systematic and rational basis, based on either pro rata revenue or headcount. The Company considers the expense allocation methodology and results to be a reasonable reflection of its utilization of services and benefits received. However, the allocations may not reflect the expenses the Company would have incurred if the Company had been a standalone company for the periods presented. The impact of allocated expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations is summarized in Note 17. Related Party Transactions. The Consolidated Balance Sheets also include certain assets and liabilities that have historically been held at the Parent, but which are specifically identifiable and attributable to TIH. Historically, cash has been managed through bank accounts controlled by TFC, as well as accounts controlled by TIH. Accordingly, cash controlled by TFC has been excluded from the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and only cash amounts in accounts controlled by the TIH business are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Transfers of cash, both to and from TFC, are reflected as a component of Members' Equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and as a financing activity in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The majority of the Company’s operating cash is held in interest-bearing depository accounts at Truist Bank, a wholly owned subsidiary of TFC. TFC pays certain operating invoices on behalf of TIH. Transfers of cash to TFC for these purposes are reflected as operating activities in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. All intracompany transactions and accounts within the TIH consolidated entities have been eliminated. All intercompany transactions between TIH and the Parent are considered to be cash settled. Transactions between TIH and the Parent are discussed in Note 17. Related Party Transactions. ----- ###### Revision of Previously Reported Amounts The Company has revised the previously reported amounts for the following financial statement line items included within Current assets in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2022, to correct certain immaterial errors that were identified by the Company during the current year: ###### Receivables, net (1) $ 275 $ 277 Contract assets, net 243 232 Contract liabilities 77 71 (1) The Company has revised the previously reported amount of Receivables, net as of December 31, 2022. Refer to Note 1. Organization and Business Description for more information. Contract assets arise when the Company recognizes revenue for amounts which have not yet been billed and are reflected in Commissions, fees and other receivables, net in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Deferred revenue (i.e., contract liabilities) relates to payments received in advance of performance under the contract, before the transfer of a good or service to the customer and is presented as Deferred revenue – current or Deferred revenue – noncurrent in the Consolidated Balance Sheets based on when the associated revenue is expected to be recognized. Remaining Performance Obligations Remaining performance obligations (i.e., contract liabilities) represent the portion of the contract price for which work has not been performed but cash has been received. As of December 31, 2023, the aggregate amount of the contract price allocated to remaining performance obligations was $77 million. ----- ###### The estimated revenue expected to be recognized in the future related to performance obligations that are unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) at the end of the reporting period is as follows: ###### Federal Current $ (20) $ 122 Deferred (95)  — Total (115)  122 State: Current (1)  28 Deferred (20)  — Total (21)  28 Total $ (136) $ 150 Income tax (benefit) expense allocated to AOCI was an immaterial amount for the year ended December 31, 2023 and $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Income tax (benefit) expense differed from the amounts computed by applying the U.S. Federal income tax rate to pretax income as follows: Year Ended December 31, ###### Federal income taxes at statutory rate $ — $ 124 Increase (decrease) in provision for income taxes as a result of: State income taxes, net of tax benefit 7 22 US federal tax prior to Partnership Conversion 23 — Partnership Conversion impacts (167)  — Other, net 1 4 Income tax (benefit) provision $ (136) $ 150 ----- ###### For periods after the Partnership Conversion, federal income taxes will not be allocated to TIH, its subsidiary partnerships, or subsidiary disregarded entities; as such, the applicable federal statutory tax rate impact for the year ended December 31, 2023 rounds to zero. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the provision for income taxes represents an effective tax rate of 25.4%. Significant DTAs and DTLs are presented in the following table: December 31, ###### DTAs Accruals and reserves $ — $ 9 Compensation and benefits 2 117 Pension — 15 Operating lease liabilities 1 32 Unearned insurance commissions 1 28 Federal and state NOLs and other carryforwards — 13 Other — 3 Total DTAs 4 217 DTLs Goodwill and other intangible assets 4 233 Operating lease assets 1 26 Deferred costs 1 72 Fixed assets — 5 Total DTLs 6 336 Deferred income taxes, net $ (2) $ (119) The DTAs as of December 31, 2022 included federal and state NOLs and other federal and state carryforwards that would expire, if not utilized, in varying amounts and years. As of December 31, 2022, the Company believed it was more likely than not that the Company would not realize the benefits of some deferred tax assets. As such, a small valuation allowance was recorded related to certain state tax attributes. These attributes were distributed to the Parent in the Partnership Conversion and are no longer attributes of the Company as of December 31, 2023. Estimated amounts related to underpayment of income taxes, including interest and penalties, are classified as a component of Income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and were not material for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. ----- ###### The following table provides a rollforward of the Company’s gross federal and state unrecognized tax benefits (“UTBs”), excluding interest and penalties: ###### Balance, January 1 $ 1 $ — Increases in UTBs due to acquisitions — 1 Reduction in a prior year position (1)  — Balance, December 31 $ — $ 1 The amount of UTBs that would favorably affect the Company’s effective tax rate, if recognized, was $1 million as of December 31, 2022. Interest and penalties related to UTBs are recorded within Income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Upon the Partnership Conversion, the unrecognized tax benefit was transferred to the Parent and a related tax benefit associated with the transfer of $1 million was recognized. There were no interest and penalties related to UTBs as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. The Company recorded net income tax receivable of $4 million and $23 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 12. Members' Equity The Amended and Restated TIH LLC Agreement dated April 3, 2023 (""LLC Agreement""), which initially became effective upon the Partnership Conversion in February 2023, provides for classes of units, allocation of profits and losses, distribution preferences, and other member rights. Pursuant to the LLC Agreement, TIH may issue an unlimited number of Preferred Units (refer to Note 9. Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Units for more information), Common Units, Class W Units, and Incentive Units (refer to Note 13. Equity Incentive Compensation for more information; the Incentive Units represent equity instruments issued to an economic interest holder entity which then issues Profits Interests to employees). With respect to distributions, excluding tax distributions, the Preferred Units rank senior to the Common Units, Class W Units, and Incentive Units. The Common Units rank senior to the Class W Units and Incentive Units, which are entitled to distributions only after holders of the Common Units have received distributions equal to their initial investment. Incentive Units are subject to vesting conditions and receive distributions above a threshold value that is established upon initial grant. One member holding Common Units and Class W Units has protections that allow the member to force the occurrence of certain liquidity events, including an IPO or Change of Control (that meet certain criteria as defined in the LLC Agreement) with respect to the interests held after minimum holding period requirements have been satisfied. In lieu of a liquidity event, TFC may elect to purchase the Common Units and Class W Units held by that member. Further, TFC may force minority interest holders to participate in certain defined transactions with respect to the Common Units and Class W Units, and the minority interest holders may be afforded participation in other defined transactions that TFC is participating in with respect to its interests in ----- ###### TIH. Additional information about the rights and privileges of the Common Units and Class W Units is provided below. Common Units In addition to the rights described above, applicable to both the Common Units and Class W Units, members that are accredited investors, holding in excess of 5% of the outstanding Common Units, are entitled to preemptive rights allowing pro rata participation in certain issuances of additional securities by the Company to TFC. Such preemptive rights also apply to secondary transactions executed by TFC. The Company concluded the preemptive rights represent a freestanding financial instrument separate from the Common Units. At the issuance date and as of December 31, 2023, the Company concluded the preemptive rights had de minimis value, as they entitle the counterparty to purchase securities based on occurrence of a contingent event at a price to be determined in the future. The Company expects such price to approximate fair value at the time of purchase. There were 975 million and zero Common Units issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Class W Units In addition to the rights described above, upon consummation of an IPO, holders of Class W Units shall receive warrants to purchase shares of common stock in the public registrant equal to 3.75% of its fully diluted capitalization (the “Warrant Rights”). The Company concluded the Warrant Rights constitute a freestanding financial instrument separate from the Class W Units. At the issuance date and as of December 31, 2023, the Company concluded the Warrant Rights had de minimis value, as they entitle the counterparty to receive warrants only upon an IPO, occurrence of which is inherently uncertain. Class W Units held by corporate entities on behalf of others may be repurchased for cash upon an IPO at the direction of the TIH Board of Managers. Additionally, the Class W Units contain conversion rights that allow for exchange of Class W Units for Common Units with an equal value in contemplation of certain transactions other than an IPO. The Company shall provide for an equitable adjustment to the number of Class W Units outstanding in connection with a unit split, unit dividend, recapitalization or reclassification with respect to the Common Units. There were 38 million and zero Class W Units issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company declared and paid distributions of $110 million to members holding Common Units and Class W Units. Prior to the Partnership Conversion in February 2023 the Company declared and paid a dividend of $1.3 billion to TFC as the sole holder of TIH Inc. capital stock. ----- ###### Common Units Co-Investment In connection with the Partnership Conversion in February 2023, the Company provided certain employees with the opportunity to co-invest in TIH Common Units at fair value. TIH offered to fund up to 100% of the initial purchase price for such Common Units (subject to certain limitations) through a full recourse loan secured by the Common Units. Under the program, employees purchased 2 million Common Units for cash totaling $16 million and 6 million Common Units for full recourse loans totaling $60 million. The Company plans to enforce the recourse terms for the holders, which bear interest at the Applicable Federal Rate (“AFR”) in effect at issuance of the loan. Accordingly, the principal balance on the resulting loans is recorded as a deduction from Members’ Equity in the Consolidated Statements of Changes in Members' Equity and the issued Common Units are deemed not compensatory. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company received principal repayments on the full recourse loans of $10 million as well as an immaterial amount of interest payments, which were recorded as capital contributions upon receipt. 13. Equity Incentive Compensation Parent Equity Incentive Plans Prior to establishment of the TIH Plans in April 2023, the Company did not have its own stock or stock-based compensation plans. Eligible TIH employees participated in the TFC Plans, under which they were granted RSAs, RSUs, and PSUs. These awards were issued pursuant to plans approved by TFC shareholders, as well as those assumed from acquired entities. Substantially all awards were granted in February of each year. Grants to non-executive employees primarily consist of RSUs. Typical vesting periods under the TFC Plans range from one to five years and require continued service over such period to vest in the award, except for retirement eligible employees that may have shorter service requirements. As of December 31, 2023, there were 34 million shares available for future grants under the TFC Plans. All awards granted under the TFC Plans will be settled in shares of TFC common stock. As a result, all related equity account balances remain at the TFC level, with only expenses for the awards granted to the employees providing service to the Company recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. ----- ###### RSA, RSU and PSU Activity The following table presents the activity related to awards of RSAs, RSUs and PSUs granted to TIH employees under the TFC Plans: Weighted Number of Average Grant ###### Stock compensation expense related to RSAs, RSUs and PSUs $ 25 $ 59 Stock compensation expense related to RSAs, RSUs and PSUs, net of tax 23 42 For awards granted under the TFC Plans, all of the stock compensation expense recognized by the Company in 2023 and 2022 is included within corporate allocations, of which $22 million and $57 million, respectively, relate directly to Company employees, and $3 million and $2 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively, is related to allocations for TFC’s corporate and shared employee stock-based compensation expenses. Employee Stock Purchase Plan In addition to the equity incentive awards discussed above, TFC began sponsoring an ESPP in 2022. Eligible employees, including TIH employees, consist of those who have been employed for at least twelve months and work at least 20 hours per week. Under the ESPP, shares of TFC common stock may be purchased at the end of ----- ###### an offering period spanning six months at 85% of the fair market value on the purchase date. Employees may purchase shares having a value not exceeding 15% of their gross compensation during an offering period, but not more than the statutory limitation of $25,000 per year. During the year ended December 31, 2023, TIH employees purchased 528 thousand shares of TFC common stock at an average price of $27 per share, resulting in compensation cost of $3 million recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. During the year ended December 31, 2022, TIH employees purchased 225 thousand shares of TFC common stock at an average price of $37, resulting in compensation cost of $2 million recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. TIH Equity Incentive Plan As described in Note 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, on April 3, 2023, TIH adopted the TIH Plans. Pursuant to the TIH Plans, TIH may issue the following types of awards to employees and other service providers: • Phantom Equity Units. The Phantom Equity Units, issued directly by TIH pursuant to the Truist Insurance Holdings, LLC LTIP Unit Plan (the “Phantom Equity Units Plan”), provide for cash compensation in the future based on the equity value of TIH and vest in four equal annual tranches based solely on continued service over a four-year period (or shorter for retirement-eligible employees). Cash payments shall be made on the respective vesting date for each separately vesting tranche of the award based on fair value of the underlying equity at such time. • Phantom Profits Interests. The Phantom Profits Interests, issued directly by TIH pursuant to the Truist Insurance Holdings, LLC Appreciation Unit Plan (the “Phantom Profits Interests Units Plan”), provide for cash compensation in the future based on appreciation in the TIH equity value above a threshold established at the time of issuance and vest on achievement of a performance condition including a Change of Control or occurrence of an IPO or Spin-Off (referred to collectively herein as “Triggering Events” or individually as a “Triggering Event”) as defined in the Phantom Profits Interests Units Plan. Continued employment through consummation of the relevant Triggering Event (and in certain cases, for a fixed period after consummation of the relevant Triggering Event) is required. Cash payments shall be made on the relevant vesting date. • Profits Interests. The Profits Interests, granted pursuant to the Truist Insurance Holdings, LLC Profits Interests Plan (the “Profits Interests Plan”) represent a perpetual equity interest in an entity that holds Incentive Units issued directly by TIH. Certain of the Profits Interests vest annually in equal tranches based on continued service over a four-year period (the “Time-Vested Profits Interests”), while others are subject to the same Triggering Events as the Phantom Profits Interests (the “Event-Vested Profits Interests”). The Company concluded the Phantom Equity Units and Phantom Profits Interests must be classified as liabilities, as they are expected to be settled in cash. As liability-classified awards, the Phantom Equity Units and Phantom Profits Interests are required to be marked to fair value each period through settlement; however, with respect to the Phantom Profits Interests, no amounts are recognized as compensation cost until the underlying Triggering Events become probable of occurring. As of December 31, 2023, the Company concluded the occurrence of a Triggering Event was not probable, and accordingly, no compensation cost on the ----- ###### Phantom Profits Interests and Event-Vested Profits Interests has been recognized. The fair value of the Phantom Equity Units is determined based on the value of the underlying TIH Common Units (refer to the Stock Price input below, which describes how the fair value of TIH Common Units was determined) considering a discount for lack of marketability. The fair value of the Phantom Profits Interests is determined based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model, inputs to which are described below. The Profits Interests represent perpetual, non-voting equity interests, and accordingly, the Company concluded equity classification is appropriate. The fair value of the Profits Interests is measured on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and is not remeasured. Inputs to the Black-Scholes option pricing model, used to value the Phantom Profits Interests and Profits Interests (Time-Vested and Event-Vested), for grants issued during the year ended December 31, 2023 were derived as follows: • Stock Price. Per-unit value estimated based on the Company’s aggregate equity value implied by a secondary transaction that occurred with respect to its Common Units and Class W Units in April 2023, considering movements in the market capitalization of guideline public companies from such date to the respective valuation date. • Expected Term. Determined based on management expectations regarding timing of a liquidity event with respect to TIH. • Risk-Free Rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the United States Treasury yield curve for a term that is consistent with the expected term of the underlying awards. • Volatility. As the Time-Vested and Event-Vested Profits Interests are not publicly traded securities, volatility is estimated using average historical stock volatilities of several unrelated public companies that are considered comparable to TIH, adjusting for differences in capital structure, over a period equivalent to the expected term of the awards. • Dividend Yield. The Company does not expect to pay dividends on its Common Units; accordingly, expected dividends are equal to zero. During the year ended December 31, 2023, awards in the TFC Plans held by certain executives were cancelled and replaced with various awards under the TIH Plans.

Use of Estimates The preparation of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and the underlying assumptions affect the amounts of assets and liabilities reported, disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities and reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change include the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets, recognition of contingent revenues, amortization of deferred costs, equity incentive compensation, and income taxes. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that management believes to be reasonable based on specific circumstances. 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Recognition The Company generates revenues primarily through commissions and fees from insureds, other brokerage firms and insurance carriers. Generally, customers within the Retail segment are commercial and individual insured parties. The Retail segment generates revenues by: • Identifying, negotiating and placing insurance coverage, principally related to property, casualty, employee benefits and other insurance products (“policy placement services”). These policy placement services may also be provided in conjunction with related and unrelated agents and brokers. • Providing risk management consulting services, principally related to property and casualty insurance (“risk management services”). • Providing consulting and administration services related to employee benefits (“employee benefits services”). Generally, customers within the Wholesale segment are retail brokerage firms or insurance carriers. The Wholesale segment generates revenues by: • Identifying, negotiating and placing insurance coverage, and providing related tools, resources and services to retail brokerage firms, principally related to excess and surplus, specialized or hard to place property, casualty, life, employee benefits and other insurance products (“policy placement services”). These services may be provided through, or in conjunction with, related and unrelated agents and brokers. • Acting as an agent or broker for insurance carriers by providing services such as sales, marketing, selecting, negotiating, underwriting, servicing and placing insurance coverage on their behalf (“policy placement services”). • Providing claims administration services and other post-placement administrative services for insurance carriers (“claims administration and other post-placement administrative services”). Generally, customers within the Services segment are commercial and individual insured parties. The Services segment generates revenues by: ----- ###### • Identifying, negotiating and placing title insurance (“policy placement services”). • Providing settlement, recording, escrow and other trustee services in conjunction with real estate transactions (“closing services”). • Acting as a qualified intermediary in facilitating the exchange of properties and providing escrow services in conjunction with Internal Revenue Code Section 1031 Exchanges (“1031 Exchange Services”). Refer to Note 4. Revenue Recognition for more information. Commissions and Fees The Company earns commissions based on a percentage of premiums paid by insured parties, or contractually determined fees from customers based on an agreed-upon level of service, usually in lieu of commissions. Commissions are recognized at the effective date of the bound policy and generally are based on a percentage of premiums paid by the insured for insurance coverage or employee headcount for employer sponsored benefit plans. Commissions depend upon a large number of factors, including the type of risk being placed, the particular insurance carrier’s demand, the expected loss experience of the particular risk of coverage, and historical benchmarks surrounding the level of effort necessary for the Company to place and service the insurance contract. Rather than being tied to the amount of premiums, fees are most often based on an expected level of effort to provide services. Most insurance premiums are subject to cancellations; therefore, commissions are recognized net of estimated policy cancellations, which are based upon the Company's historical cancellations. Commissions and fees for policy placement services are earned at a point in time upon the effective date of bound insurance coverage, as no performance obligation exists after coverage is bound. Any endorsement or other modification made to a policy is treated as a new contract with revenue recognized on the later of the endorsement binding date or the effective date of the modification. Commissions and fees for other services such as risk management, employee benefits management and administration, or claims administration services are generally recognized over time as the services are performed. In situations where multiple performance obligations exist within a contract, the Company estimates the stand- alone selling price for each separate performance obligation and allocates the transaction price accordingly. The corresponding revenue is recognized as the performance obligations are fulfilled. Supplemental Revenues Certain insurance carriers may pay the Company additional revenues for the volume of premiums placed with them and for insights into the Company's sales pipeline, sales capabilities, or risk selection knowledge. These amounts are in excess of the commission and fee revenues discussed above, and not all insurance policies placed by the Company with insurance carriers are eligible for supplemental revenues. Unlike contingent revenues, discussed below, these revenues are primarily a fixed amount or fixed percentage of premium of the underlying eligible insurance contracts. For supplemental revenue contracts based on a fixed percentage of premium, the obligation to the carrier is substantially completed upon the effective date of the underlying ----- ###### insurance contract and revenue is fully earned at that time. For supplemental revenue contracts based on a fixed amount, revenue is recognized ratably over the contract period consistent with the performance of the Company's obligations, generally over an annual term. These revenues are received on a quarterly or annual basis. Contingent Revenues Contingent revenues are generated from contracts between the Company and insurance carriers for which the Company is compensated for certain growth, profitability, or other performance-based metrics. These amounts are variable and in excess of the commission and fee revenues discussed above, and not all policies placed with participating insurance carriers are eligible for contingent revenues. The Company's performance obligation of achieving these metrics is satisfied over time, and revenue is therefore recognized over time using a time-based measure of progress. Accordingly, the Company must estimate the amount of consideration that will be received, such that a significant reversal of revenue is not probable. The Company determines estimates each period on a contract- by-contract or carrier-by-carrier basis, where available. Because the expectation of the contingent revenue amounts to be earned can vary from period to period, especially in contracts sensitive to loss ratios, the estimates might change significantly from quarter to quarter. Variable consideration is recognized when the Company concludes, based on all the facts and information available at the reporting date, that it is probable that a significant revenue reversal will not occur in future periods. Depending on performance, the Company may be required to return contingent commissions to the insurance carrier. When such amounts are deemed probable and reasonably estimable, the Company records a contingent liability within Accounts payable and accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Third-Party Producer Costs Third-party producer costs are excluded from gross revenues in the determination of total revenues. Third-party producer costs represent commissions paid to unrelated agents and brokers with respect to the placement of certain insurance policies. The Company recognizes this contra-revenue in the same manner as the commission revenue to which it relates. Deferred Costs The Company incurs costs to provide policy placement and other services. Those costs are either (i) costs to obtain a contract, (ii) costs to fulfill a contract, or (iii) all other costs. Refer to Note 4. Revenue Recognition for more information. (i) Costs to obtain – The Company defers certain costs to obtain customer contracts, primarily incremental commissions paid to internal producers on new business. These incremental costs are deferred and amortized over a 15-year period. For all other incremental costs incurred to obtain customer contracts, the Company has applied the practical expedient to recognize the incremental ----- ###### costs of obtaining contracts as an expense when incurred, as the amortization period of the assets that otherwise would have been recognized is one year or less. When amortized, these incremental costs are included in Compensation and benefits in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. (ii) Costs to fulfill – The Company incurs costs to fulfill a contract (or anticipated contract) with a customer that are expected to be recovered in the future. These costs relate to compensation and benefits of internal producers and related support staff who perform policy placement services, and are incurred prior to the effective date of the underlying policy. Deferrable costs to fulfill relate to fulfillment activities, which include collecting underwriting information from insureds or agents of the insureds, assessing their insurance needs and negotiating their placement with one or more insurance carriers, and underwriting their risk. Deferrable costs to fulfill incurred prior to the policy effective date are capitalized and expensed on the policy effective date. (iii) Other costs that are not costs to obtain or fulfill are expensed as incurred. Examples include other operating costs such as rent, utilities, management costs, overhead costs, legal and other professional fees, technology costs, insurance related costs, communication and advertising, and travel and entertainment. Depreciation and amortization are expensed over the useful lives of the underlying assets. Fiduciary Cash, Fiduciary Receivables and Fiduciary Liabilities The Company presents certain assets and liabilities that arise from activities in which the Company engages as an intermediary, where it collects premiums from insureds to remit to insurance carriers or other agents/brokers, holds funds from insurance carriers to distribute to insureds for claims on covered losses, and holds refunds due to customers, as fiduciary assets and fiduciary liabilities. Fiduciary cash in the Consolidated Balance Sheets represents funds in the Company's possession collected from insureds to be remitted to insurance carriers or other agents/brokers, and funds from insurance carriers to be distributed to insureds for the settlement of claims or refunds. The Company separately accounts for and holds these funds in a fiduciary capacity until disbursement, and the use of such funds is restricted by laws in certain states and foreign jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Various state and foreign agencies regulate insurance brokers and provide specific requirements that limit the type of investments that may be made with such funds. Accordingly, the Company may invest these funds in cash and money market fund accounts. The Company may earn interest income on these funds where allowed by state law. Such interest income is included in Investment income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The net change in fiduciary cash is represented by the net change in fiduciary receivables and fiduciary liabilities, and is presented as Net cash provided by financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Uncollected premiums are presented as Fiduciary receivables in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Likewise, payables to insurance carriers are consolidated and presented as Fiduciary liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The carrying amounts of Fiduciary cash, Fiduciary receivables, and Fiduciary liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets approximate fair value because of the short-term duration of these instruments. ----- ###### Commissions, Fees, and Other Receivables Commissions, fees, and other receivables are net of allowances for estimated policy cancellations and expected credit losses. The allowance for estimated policy cancellations was $29 million and $32 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which represents a reserve for future reversals in commission and fee revenues related to the estimated cancellation of placed insurance policies that were in force as of each year end. The allowance for expected credit losses was $9 million as of both December 31, 2023 and 2022. The Company establishes the allowance for estimated policy cancellations through a charge against Commissions and fees, and the allowance for expected credit losses through a charge to Other operating expenses. The Company records the allowance for estimated policy cancellations upon initial recognition of receivables. The allowance for estimated policy cancellations is based on historical cancellation experience, with adjustments for known circumstances, when relevant. The Company records the allowance for expected credit losses upon the initial recognition of receivables. The allowance for credit losses represents the best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses based on a combination of factors, including an assessment of historical loss rates, current and expected economic conditions, aging of outstanding receivables, and other qualitative and quantitative analyses. Balances are written off against the allowance for credit losses when the Company determines that the balances are not recoverable. Both allowances are based on estimates and assumptions which could change in the future as more information becomes known and could impact the amounts reported and disclosed herein. The Company periodically reviews the adequacy of these allowances and makes adjustments as necessary. Fixed Assets Fixed assets consist primarily of software, computer equipment, leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures, vehicles, and buildings. The Company carries fixed assets at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the improvements’ estimated useful lives or the lease term. Expenditures for capital improvements are capitalized, and expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed to operations as incurred. Upon sale or retirement of fixed assets, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts. Refer to Note 8. Fixed Assets for more information. Income Taxes The Company’s income tax expense is calculated based on expected income tax rates in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates and requires the use of management’s estimates and judgments. Deferred tax assets and liabilities (“DTAs” and “DTLs”) result from differences between the timing of the recognition of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and for income tax purposes. They are measured using the applicable enacted income tax rates in the periods in which they are expected to be realized. ----- ###### In assessing the realizability of DTAs, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the DTA will not be realized. The Company’s ability to realize its DTAs depends upon the generation of sufficient future taxable income to allow for the utilization of its net operating loss carryforwards and future deductible temporary differences. The Company records valuation allowances to reduce the carrying value of DTAs to amounts that it expects are more-likely-than-not to be realized. The determination of accruals for unrecognized tax benefits includes the application of complex tax laws. Management judgment is required in determining the gross unrecognized tax benefits’ related liabilities. Accruals for unrecognized tax benefits are established when, despite the belief that tax positions are supportable, there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold, which is a tax position that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority. Historically, the Company’s operations have been included in TFC’s U.S. federal consolidated tax return, certain foreign tax returns, and certain state tax returns. As a result of the Partnership Conversion, the Company has shifted from corporate taxation to pass-through taxation. This change in tax status resulted in the derecognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, as well as unrecognized tax benefit reserves, through income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Operations upon Partnership Conversion. Following the Partnership Conversion, TIH is predominantly comprised of partnerships and disregarded entities held by other partnerships – all of which are entity structures that are not subject to federal tax for purposes of each legal entity’s separate financial statements. As such, for periods subsequent to the Partnership Conversion, federal income taxes will not be allocated to TIH, its subsidiary partnerships, or subsidiary disregarded entities for purposes of these financial statements, with the exception of one corporate entity and two foreign corporations for which relevant federal and foreign taxes will be considered on a stand-alone basis. For these corporate entities, the applicable taxes will continue to be reflected within these Consolidated Financial Statements. For the purposes of these Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company’s income tax provision with respect to such corporate-form entities (including TIH prior to the Partnership Conversion) was computed as if the Company filed separate tax returns (i.e., as if the Company had not been included in the consolidated income tax return group with TFC). The separate-return method applies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of each member of a consolidated tax group as if the group member were a separate taxpayer. As a result, actual tax transactions included in the Consolidated Financial Statements of TFC may not be included in these Consolidated Financial Statements. Further, the Company’s tax results as presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements may not be reflective of the results that the Company expects to generate in the future. Also, the tax treatment of certain items reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements may not be reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements and tax returns of TFC. It is conceivable that items such as net operating losses (“NOLs”), other deferred taxes, uncertain tax positions and valuation allowances may exist in the Consolidated Financial Statements that may or may not exist in TFC’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Additionally, state taxes attributable to a limited number of states which tax the income of a partnership at the entity level will continue to be reflected within these Consolidated Financial Statements. Prior to the Partnership Conversion, the Company had a tax sharing agreement with TFC that provided for payment to the Company for NOLs and tax credits in the year generated. The Company assumed that, in the event a tax attribute was reimbursed or utilized by TFC on a consolidated or combined return, the Company ----- ###### realized the benefits of the tax attribute and recorded the utilization as a current benefit and a transfer to TFC. This resulted in a current benefit generated in 2023. Refer to Note 11. Income Taxes for more information. Business Combinations The Company uses the acquisition method of accounting for acquired businesses. Under the acquisition method, the Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the operations of an acquired business starting on the acquisition date of the business. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective estimated fair values at the date of the acquisition. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Significant judgment is often required in estimating the fair value of assets acquired, particularly intangible assets. As a result, in the case of significant acquisitions, the Company normally obtains the assistance of third-party valuation specialists in estimating fair values of tangible and intangible assets. The fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on expectations and assumptions about the future, considering the perspective of market participants. While management believes those expectations and assumptions are reasonable, they are inherently uncertain. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions. Refer to Note 5. Business Combinations for more information. Goodwill and Amortizable Intangible Assets Goodwill and amortizable intangible assets represent the excess of cost over the estimated fair value of net tangible assets of acquired businesses. Primary intangible assets are classified as either goodwill, customer relationships, trade names, non-compete agreements, or technology. Non-compete agreements and customer relationships, which consist of customer-related assets, are amortized in proportion to the realization of their economic benefit over their estimated useful lives ranging from two to twenty-five years. Trade names are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives ranging from two to fifteen years, and technology intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives ranging from two to five years. Goodwill is not amortized. The establishment of goodwill, customer relationships, trade names, non-compete agreements, and technology, and the determination of estimated useful lives are primarily based on valuations the Company receives from qualified independent third-party valuation specialists. The calculations of these amounts are based on estimates and assumptions using historical and projected financial information and recognized valuation methods. Different estimates or assumptions could produce different results. The Company carries identifiable intangible assets at cost, less accumulated amortization, in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company reviews goodwill for impairment at least annually and more frequently if business circumstances suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. The Company performs such impairment reviews at the reporting unit level. The Company may initially perform a qualitative analysis to determine if it is more likely than not that the goodwill balance is impaired. The qualitative assessment considers all relevant ----- ###### factors specific to the reporting units, including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and relevant entity-specific events. If a qualitative assessment is not performed or if a determination is made that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, then the Company will perform a quantitative analysis. The fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a non-cash impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, with the loss not exceeding the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Services reporting unit observed declines in its financial forecasts due to a decline in commercial real estate transactions attributable to rising interest rates. Therefore, the Company performed a quantitative impairment test over the Services reporting unit pursuant to which it recorded goodwill impairment of $195 million. The Company performed a qualitative assessment as part of its annual goodwill impairment analysis with respect to the Retail and Wholesale reporting units and concluded it was more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit exceed its respective carrying amount. Accordingly, there was no indication of impairment and the quantitative impairment test for the Retail and Wholesale reporting units was not performed. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company performed a qualitative assessment for its annual goodwill impairment analysis and concluded it was more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit exceed its respective carrying amount. Accordingly, there was no indication of impairment and the quantitative impairment test was not performed for any reporting unit. Refer to Note 6. Goodwill for more information. The carrying value of amortizable intangible assets attributable to each asset group is periodically reviewed by management to determine if there are events or changes in circumstances that would indicate it is more likely than not that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Accordingly, if there are any such changes in circumstances during the year, the Company assesses the carrying value of the amortizable intangible assets by considering the estimated future undiscounted cash flows generated by the corresponding asset group. Any impairment identified through this assessment may require that the carrying value of related amortizable intangible assets be adjusted and charged against current period earnings as a component of Other operating expenses. There were no impairments recorded to Amortizable intangible assets, net in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in either of the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The determinations of undiscounted cash flows used to test the recoverability of an intangible asset and the fair value of such asset are based on estimates and assumptions related to the amount and timing of future cash flows and future interest rates. Such estimates and assumptions could change in the future as more information becomes known, which could impact the amounts reported and disclosed herein. Refer to Note 7. Amortizable Intangible Assets for more information. ----- ###### Equity Incentive Compensation Parent Equity Incentive Plans The Company’s employees have historically participated in TFC’s equity incentive plans (the “TFC Plans”) that provide for the grant of Restricted Stock Awards (“RSAs”), Restricted Stock Units, (“RSUs”) and Performance Share Units (“PSUs”). In addition, during 2022, TFC adopted an employee stock purchase plan (the “ESPP”). Compensation cost has been allocated to the Company based on the awards and terms previously granted to TIH employees. The Company determines compensation cost associated with RSUs and PSUs based on the fair value of underlying TFC common stock on the date of grant less the present value of expected dividends that will be forgone during the vesting period. Compensation cost for RSAs and RSUs is generally recognized over the vesting period taking into account retirement eligibility. Forfeitures are recognized when they occur. For PSUs, compensation cost is recognized over the vesting period after considering the number of awards expected to vest based on the estimated probability of achieving the associated performance targets. Refer to Note 13. Equity Incentive Compensation for more information. TIH Equity Incentive Plan On April 3, 2023, the Board of Managers of TIH adopted several equity incentive plans (referred to collectively as the “TIH Plans”) pursuant to which it may issue Phantom Equity Units, Phantom Profits Interests and Profits Interests to TIH employees and other service providers. The terms of each are further described in Note 13. Equity Incentive Compensation. For all awards, compensation cost is recognized over the applicable requisite service period using the graded vesting method, taking into account accelerated vesting provisions for retirement-eligible employees (applicable to the Phantom Equity Units only). Forfeitures are recorded when they occur. Preferred Units Preferred Units that are mandatorily redeemable at specified or determinable dates or otherwise require settlement by issuing a variable number of Common Units are classified as a liability. Preferred Units that are mandatorily redeemable and have a fixed redemption amount and fixed redemption date are accreted to the redemption value using the effective interest method. Such accretion, as well as any distributions, are included in Interest in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations. Refer to Note 9. Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Units, for more information. Financial Instruments The Company does not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to financial risks. The Company reviews the terms of all financial instruments it issues, including all forms of debt and equity financing arrangements, to determine if such instruments are themselves derivatives in their entirety. Each instrument that is not a derivative in its entirety is assessed to determine whether it contains embedded derivatives that are required to ----- ###### be bifurcated and accounted for as a derivative financial instrument. The embedded derivative is bifurcated from the host contract and accounted for as a freestanding derivative at fair value if (i) the combined instrument is not accounted for in its entirety at fair value, (ii) the terms of the embedded derivative are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the host contract, and (iii) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative would qualify as a derivative instrument. Changes in fair value of any bifurcated embedded derivative are recorded in earnings. Additionally, the Company may issue freestanding equity-linked contracts when entering into financing arrangements. The characteristics of such instruments, including the ability of the Company to control the method of settlement, are assessed under relevant guidance to determine if classification as a component of Members' equity or liabilities is appropriate. The Company assessed all arrangements it entered into during the year ended December 31, 2023 and identified no embedded derivatives that required bifurcation; however, there were freestanding equity-linked contracts issued in connection with the April 2023 Partnership Conversion. Refer to Note 12. Members' Equity for additional information. The Company did not enter into arrangements during the year ended December 31, 2022 that required assessment. Retirement Plans Parent-Sponsored Plans Certain of the Company’s employees participate in defined benefit pension plans sponsored by TFC, which also include participants of other TFC businesses. The Company’s participation in these plans is accounted for as participation in multiemployer benefit plans. Accordingly, the Company does not record an asset or liability to recognize any portion of the funded status of such plans. The related pension expense is based on an allocation of all components of net periodic benefit costs associated with the Company's employees and is reported within Compensation and benefits in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. In addition, TFC has voluntary defined contribution plans for the benefit of substantially all Company employees meeting certain eligibility requirements. Expenses for defined contribution plans are recorded when services are rendered by employees. TIH-Sponsored Plans In addition to the Parent-sponsored plans described above, the Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans for certain internal producers in the Retail segment. These defined benefit pension plans are unfunded. Calculation of the obligations and related expenses under these plans requires the use of actuarial valuation methods and assumptions. The Company uses the corridor approach for the recognition of actuarial gains and losses resulting from variances between actual results and such actuarial assumptions. The corridor approach defers these amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Such unrecognized gains and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are amortized as a component of Compensation and benefits in the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the average remaining service period of plan participants, when the ----- ###### net gains and losses exceed 10% of the projected benefit obligation at the beginning of the year. Prior service costs and credits are similarly charged or credited to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently amortized over the average remaining service period of employees expected to receive benefits under the plan. Refer to Note 14. Retirement Plans for more information. Retention Bonus Arrangements To retain top talent, the Company grants upfront bonuses in the form of forgivable loans to certain employees, that are generally subject to claw-back over a service period of three to seven years. Upon initial payment, the Company records a prepaid asset that is amortized to compensation expense as the future services are rendered over the duration of the requisite service period. If the minimum requisite service is not rendered upon an employee leaving the Company, the Company attempts to recover any unearned portion of compensation, and subsequently reverses any previously recognized compensation cost when successful in recovering amounts. These retention bonus arrangements were discontinued with limited exceptions during the year ended December 31, 2023, as the new TIH Plans are expected to augment the retention bonus arrangements in the future. Non-Controlling Interests Non-controlling interests represent third parties’ ownership interests in certain consolidated subsidiaries. The Company evaluates its non-controlling interests to determine whether there are any redemption features that require presentation outside of permanent equity. There are currently no outstanding non-controlling interests that the Company may be required to repurchase under put options or other contractual redemption requirements that are not solely within its control. Accordingly, non-controlling interests are presented as a component of permanent equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Contingencies Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines, penalties, and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. The Company does not discount the contingent liabilities recorded. Outcomes associated with contingent liabilities may differ from the Company’s estimates, resulting in an impact, positive or negative, on earnings. Refer to Note 15. Commitments and Contingencies for more information. Leases The Company assesses at inception of a contract if it contains a lease. This assessment is based on: (i) whether the contract involves the use of a distinct identified asset, (ii) whether the Company obtains the right to substantially all the economic benefit from the use of the asset throughout the period, and (iii) whether the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset. If these criteria are met and a lease has been identified, the Company accounts for the contract as a lease under relevant accounting guidance. ----- ###### Substantially all of the Company's leases are classified as operating leases, and they primarily represent real estate leases for office space used to conduct the Company's business\, that expire on various dates through June 30, 2032. Leases generally have terms ranging between 1 to 10 years, and contain renewal options and escalation clauses based upon increases in the lessors’ operating expenses and other charges. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which is primarily composed of the initial lease liability, plus any initial direct costs incurred, less any lease incentives received. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the minimum lease payments through the term of the lease. Minimum lease payments are discounted to present value using the Company’s incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date, which approximates the rate of interest the Company expects to pay on a secured borrowing in an amount equal to the lease payments for the underlying asset under similar terms and economic conditions. The Company has elected not to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that have a term of twelve months or less at the commencement date. The effect of short-term leases on the Company’s right-of-use asset and lease liability balances would not be material. Refer to Note 16. Leases for more information. 4.

Insurance carriers establish these premium rates based upon many factors, including loss experience, risk profile and reinsurance rates paid by such insurance carriers, none of which the Company controls. (2) Fee revenues relate to compensation for services other than policy placement services and fees negotiated in lieu of commissions. (3) Supplemental and contingent commissions include additional commissions over base commissions received from insurance carriers, primarily based on one or multiple of the following metrics: volume, growth, retention, profit, underwriting results, or loss ratios. (4) Investment income consists primarily of interest on cash and fiduciary cash. There was an immaterial amount of investment income for the year ended December 31, 2022. (5) Other income consists primarily of income from non-recurring legal settlements and other miscellaneous income. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the amount of revenue recognized related to performance obligations satisfied in a previous period, inclusive of changes due to estimates, was approximately $27 million. These balances primarily consist of variable consideration received on contingent commission arrangements.

For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company deferred $45 million and $32 million of incremental costs to obtain customer contracts, respectively. The Company recorded expense of $19 million and $17 million associated with the incremental costs to obtain customer contracts for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Costs to fulfill contracts – The Company capitalizes costs incurred to fulfill contracts as “deferred contract costs”, which are included in Other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Deferred contract costs were $47 million and $44 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Capitalized fulfillment costs are amortized to expense on the policy effective date. The Company had net deferrals of $3 million and $10 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These net deferrals consist of current period costs related to performance obligations yet to be fulfilled, net of the expense of previously deferred contract fulfillment costs associated with performance obligations that were satisfied in the current period. Net expenses occur when the expense recognized within the current period exceeds the current period costs that were subject to deferral in the current period. 5. Business Combinations 2023 Acquisitions The Company did not complete any business combinations during the year ended December 31, 2023. 2022 Acquisitions During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company acquired the net assets of two insurance agencies, Kensington Vanguard National Land Services (“Kensington Vanguard”) and Centerstone Insurance and Financial Services, Inc. (“BenefitMall”). The Company expanded its presence in the title insurance market by ----- ###### acquiring Kensington Vanguard and broadened the selection of products and services offered by its Wholesale segment by acquiring BenefitMall, one of the nation’s leading employee benefits wholesale general insurance agencies. In both transactions, the Company purchased 100% of the outstanding equity interests therein. However, with respect to Kensington Vanguard, the Company acquired certain less-than-wholly-owned entities, resulting in the recognition of non-controlling interests (which is described further below). The following table summarizes the total consideration transferred and non-controlling interests recognized as of the acquisition date for each transaction: (Dollars in millions) Non Operating Effective Date of Controlling Name Segment Acquisition Cash Paid Interests Total Kensington Vanguard National Land Services March 1, 2022 $ 325 $ 22 $ 347 Services BenefitMall Wholesale September 1, 2022 845  —  845 Total $ 1,170 $ 22 $ 1,192 ----- ###### The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the aggregate assets and liabilities acquired as of the date of each acquisition:",N/A,as_expected,2024,298

Goodwill of $197 million, resulting from the acquisition of Kensington Vanguard, was assigned to the Services segment. This goodwill was subsequently impaired during 2023; refer to Note 6. Goodwill for more information. Goodwill of $483 million, resulting from the acquisition of BenefitMall, was assigned to the Wholesale segment. Goodwill amounts are net of any opening balance sheet adjustments within the allowable measurement period. Of the total goodwill of $680 million acquired in 2022, the amount deductible as of December 31, 2022 for income tax purposes was $131 million. The non-controlling interests recognized in conjunction with the acquisition of Kensington Vanguard arose from acquired joint ventures, and were valued at $22 million using a market approach based on the multiple implied by the acquisition. For the acquisitions completed during 2022, the results of operations since the acquisition dates have been consolidated with those of the Company. Additionally, in connection with the 2022 acquisition of Kensington Vanguard, the Company made upfront ----- ###### retention bonus payments that vest over a period of time based on continued employment over such defined time period. Certain individuals are eligible to receive additional amounts based on revenue growth targets as well as continued employment. Based on the terms of the arrangements, the Company concluded the payments represent compensation for post-acquisition services, to be accounted for separately from the business combination. Transaction costs associated with the 2022 acquisitions of Kensington Vanguard and BenefitMall were approximately $19 million and are included within Other operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 6. Goodwill The changes in the carrying value of goodwill by operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 are as follows:",N/A,as_expected,2024,298

(2) There were measurement period adjustments resulting in an increase to Goodwill in the Wholesale operating segment related to the 2022 acquisition of BenefitMall, and a decrease to Goodwill in the Services operating segment related to the 2022 acquisition of Kensington Vanguard. During 2023, the Services reporting unit observed declines in forecasted income due to a decline in commercial and residential real estate transactions attributable to rising interest rates. The Company concluded that these factors were indicative of a triggering event that required the Company to perform an interim quantitative goodwill impairment assessment. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes on the relevant reporting unit. The Company performed a valuation of the Services reporting unit using a combination of an income approach using a discounted cash flow methodology and a market approach using publicly traded company multiples in similar businesses. The goodwill impairment analysis required significant judgments to calculate the fair value of the Services reporting unit, including internally developed forecasts, estimations of the Services reporting unit’s long-term rate of growth, risk and control premiums, the discount rate, identification of relevant comparable public companies, and selection of relevant market multiples within an identified range. The Company considered historical experience and all available information at the time the valuation was performed. Assumptions are subject to a high degree of judgment and uncertainty. ----- ###### The results of the quantitative impairment assessment indicated that the carrying value of the Services reporting unit exceeded its fair value. As a result, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment loss of $195 million in the year ended December 31, 2023, which reduced the goodwill in the Services reporting unit to zero. 7.

Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Units Subsequent to the Partnership Conversion, a portion of TFC’s existing ownership interest in the Company was recapitalized into mandatorily redeemable Preferred Units with a face value and initial liquidation preference of $5 billion, representing 5 million shares with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share. The Company concluded the face amount of the Preferred Units should be recorded as a dividend to TFC. The Preferred Units are entitled to quarterly distributions which accrue at a rate of 8.25% per annum whether or not declared. Compounding occurs on each quarterly distribution date to the extent payments are not made. The Preferred Units are mandatorily redeemable on the 50th anniversary of the issuance date or upon occurrence of liquidity events including an Initial Public Offering (“IPO”) or Change of Control meeting certain criteria as defined in the Amended and Restated TIH LLC Agreement dated April 3, 2023 (the “LLC Agreement”). TIH may call the Preferred Units at any time five years after issuance thereof, and TFC may put the Preferred Units back to the Company at any time when its ownership of the Company falls below 50%. In all cases, the Preferred Units are required to be repurchased at the liquidation preference, including accrued but unpaid dividends. Due to the mandatory redemption feature, the Preferred Units are classified as liabilities rather than as a component of equity, with the preferred annual returns being accrued and recorded as Interest in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. During the year ended December 31, 2023, TIH recognized interest expense of $315 million related to the Preferred Units, of which $210 million was paid in cash during the ----- ###### period. Interest not yet paid is recorded as accrued interest and included as a component of Accounts payable and accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2023. If the Company was required to redeem the Preferred Units at December 31, 2023, it would be required to pay $5,105 million, which is equal to the liquidation preference on the Preferred Units, including accrued but unpaid preferred returns. The maximum amount that the Company could be required to pay to redeem the Preferred Units on the mandatory redemption date is equal to the liquidation preference on the Preferred Units at such time, including accrued but unpaid preferred returns. 10. Revolving Credit Facility On April 3, 2023, TIH entered into a Credit Agreement with TFC. Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, TFC has made available a $700 million credit facility from which the Company may draw revolving loans and letters of credit at any time through the fifth anniversary of the issuance thereof (the “Credit Facility”). Letters of credit are subject to a $200 million sublimit. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had not drawn on the Credit Facility. In addition, the unused portion of the Credit Facility is subject to a quarterly commitment fee that varies between 0.125% and 0.35% per annum, based on an agreed-upon leverage ratio. As of December 31, 2023, the commitment fee was 0.30%. Draws on the Credit Facility are permitted in U.S. dollars and interest is variable at a rate based on Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) or a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (i) the prime lending rate, (ii) the overnight federal funds rate plus 0.50% or (iii) one-month Term SOFR plus 1.00%, plus an applicable margin of up to 1.25%. The minimum base rate on draws bearing the base rate is 1.00%. Term SOFR loans bear an applicable margin of up to 2.25%. 11. Income Taxes As discussed in Note 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, as a result of the Partnership Conversion during 2023, TIH is now predominantly composed of partnerships and disregarded entities held by other partnerships. As such, for periods after the Partnership Conversion, federal income taxes will not be allocated to TIH LLC, its subsidiary partnerships, or subsidiary disregarded entities for purposes of these Consolidated Financial Statements. Further, a limited number of states tax the income of partnerships at the entity level, driving a low state effective tax rate for the Company. TIH does include one corporate entity and two foreign corporations for which relevant federal and foreign taxes are considered on a stand-alone basis and reflected within these Consolidated Financial Statements, if applicable. Prior to the Partnership Conversion, the Company did not file separate income tax returns and was included in the federal and state income tax returns of TFC, filing in foreign jurisdictions in accordance with applicable consolidation rules. The income tax expense or benefit presented has been determined on a separate return basis as if the Company filed a separate income tax return in all periods presented. Prior to the Partnership Conversion, the Company had a tax sharing agreement with TFC that provided for payment to the Company for NOLs and tax credits in the year generated. The Company assumes that, in the event a tax attribute is reimbursed or utilized by TFC on a consolidated or combined return, the Company has realized the benefits of ----- ###### the tax attribute and records the utilization as a current benefit and a transfer to TFC. This resulted in a current benefit generated in 2023. Given that the year ended December 31, 2022 took place prior to the Partnership Conversion, the resulting provision for income taxes for that period includes the impacts of U.S. corporate taxation. In comparison, the provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2023 is reflective of the discretely calculated corporate tax impacts for January and February 2023 (prior to the Partnership Conversion) of $29 million, the tax benefit associated with the corporate deferred tax liability transfer to the Parent of $166 million, the tax benefit associated with the transfer of the unrecognized tax benefit to the Parent of $1 million, as well as tax impacts attributable to the remaining ten months in the year, calculated on a post Partnership Conversion basis. TFC’s federal income tax returns are no longer subject to assessment by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for taxable years prior to 2020. With limited exceptions, TFC is no longer subject to assessment by state and local taxing authorities for taxable years prior to 2018. Income tax (benefit) expense consists of the following: Year Ended December 31,",N/A,as_expected,2024,298

There was no cash paid on vested Phantom Equity Units during the year ended December 31, 2023, as the shares that vested during the year ended December 31, 2023 resulted from an acceleration event rather than under the normal vesting schedule. Pursuant to the Phantom Equity Units Plan, cash payouts only occur under the normal vesting schedule. The fair value of the Phantom Equity Units was determined based on the total equity value of TIH, considering a discount for lack of marketability. The Company determined the total equity value of TIH at December 31, 2023 based on the fair value implied by a secondary transaction that occurred with respect to the Common Units and Class W Units in April 2023, considering movements in the market capitalization of comparable public companies during the intervening period.

Retirement Plans TFC sponsors defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans that are shared amongst its businesses. Participation of TIH employees in these plans is reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as though TIH participates in a multiemployer plan with TFC. Defined Benefit Plans Parent-Sponsored Plans TFC provides defined benefit retirement plans qualified under the Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”). In addition, supplemental retirement benefits are provided to certain key officers under supplemental defined benefit executive retirement plans, which are not qualified under the IRC. Benefits are based on years of service, age at retirement, and the employee’s compensation during the five highest consecutive years of earnings within the last ten years of employment. Assets and liabilities of such plans are retained by TFC. Under the multiemployer approach, net periodic pension benefit for the Company's employees has been allocated based on percent of salary for U.S. employees and active employee headcount in other jurisdictions. Net periodic pension benefit of $10 million and $13 million were included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, resulting from changes in estimates regarding TFC's expected return on plan assets. No contributions were made to TFC for TIH employees’ participation in defined benefit plans for the years ended December 31, 2023 or 2022. ----- ###### TIH-Sponsored Plans The Company provides defined benefit pension plans that are not qualified under the IRC. The benefits are available only to certain eligible producers within the Company’s Retail segment. Benefits are based on years of service and the eligible producer’s book of business prior to and following retirement. The Company has not historically funded the pension obligations and has not invested funds for the satisfaction of future obligations during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. The following tables present a summary of the defined benefit pension plans. In the Consolidated Balance Sheets, the projected benefit obligation is recorded as a component of Other current liabilities and Other liabilities. The data is calculated using an actuarial measurement date of December 31. Year Ended December 31,",N/A,as_expected,2024,298

For full-time employees who are 21 years of age or older with one year or more of service, TFC makes matching contributions of up to 6% of the employee’s compensation. In some instances, the matching contribution varies based on profitability metrics of the participant's respective line of business. TIH recognized $58 million and $50 million of expense related to TFC matching contributions for these plans on behalf of TIH employees for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Effective January 1, 2024, the Company adopted a consistent 401(k) matching policy across all business units, of up to 4% of the employee's compensation. 15. Commitments and Contingencies Legal Proceedings The Company records losses for claims at the time and to the extent they are probable and estimable. The Company accrues anticipated costs of settlement, damages, losses for liability claims and, under certain conditions, costs of defense, based upon historical experience or to the extent specific losses are probable and estimable. Otherwise, the Company expenses these costs as incurred. If the best estimate of a probable loss is a range rather than a specific amount, the Company accrues the amount at the lower end of the range. The Company’s accruals for legal matters that were probable and estimable were not material as of December 31, 2023. The Company estimates reasonably possible losses, in excess of amounts accrued, of up to approximately $10 million as of December 31, 2023. This estimate does not represent the Company’s maximum loss exposure, and actual losses may vary significantly. In addition, the matters underlying this estimate will change from time to time. Estimated losses are based upon currently available information and involve considerable judgment, given that claims often include significant legal uncertainties, damages alleged by plaintiffs are often unspecified or overstated, discovery may not have started or may not be complete, and material facts may be disputed or unsubstantiated, among other factors. For certain matters, the Company may be unable to estimate the loss or range of loss, even if it believes that a loss is probable or reasonably possible, until developments in the case provide additional information sufficient to support such an estimate. Such matters are not accrued for and are not reflected in the estimate of reasonably possible losses. The following is a description of certain legal proceedings in which the Company is involved: Claims against McGriff Insurance Services, Inc. and Navigators Specialty Insurance Company In mid-September 2022, a life sciences corporate client (the “Insured”) of McGriff Insurance Services (“McGriff”) sought damages against McGriff and Navigators Specialty Insurance Company (“Navigators”, the insurance carrier) in excess of a $15 million policy limit relating to excess insurance coverage for dozens of third-party personal injury claims brought against the Insured, arising from a recalled medical device product ----- ###### that allegedly was infected with tuberculosis (the “Loss”). McGriff is a component of the Retail operating segment. The Insured alleged errors-and-omissions claims against McGriff relating to its procurement of a Navigators excess liability policy with a $15 million limit after Navigators denied coverage for the Loss. Effective November 14, 2022, Navigators and the Insured agreed to dismiss the then-pending coverage litigation involving McGriff in exchange for certain potential future payments from Navigators and McGriff to the Insured, as well as an express cap on any future, potential exposure to McGriff relating to the ongoing Loss. On December 11, 2023, the Insured filed a lawsuit in federal court in Maryland, seeking to recover alleged damages from McGriff up to the remaining cap. On January 15, 2024, McGriff filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit for failure to state a claim. The Insured filed an opposition to the motion on February 8, 2024; the court has not yet issued a ruling. The financial impact of this matter has not had a material adverse effect and is not currently expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or operating results. Demand to Starwind Specialty Insurance Services, LLC dba American Team Managers American Team Managers (“ATM”), a division of Starwind Specialty Insurance Services, LLC (""Starwind""), operates a transportation liability insurance program under a General Agency Agreement with United Specialty Insurance Company (“USIC” or the “Insurer”). Starwind is a component of the Wholesale operating segment. As the Managing General Agent of the program, ATM allegedly had underwriting and binding, as well as claims adjusting authority. On March 24, 2023, USIC sent a non-specific demand to ATM regarding mediation and efforts to resolve auto-accident litigation involving insured Dennis Alonso (“Alonso” or the “Insured”) and three injured parties (the “Plaintiffs”). At the time, the litigation at issue was pending on appeal in California state court, Abbas Souresrafil, et al. v. Dennis Alonso (the “Underlying Litigation”). On October 21, 2022, following a jury trial, the Los Angeles County Superior Court entered judgment against the Insured in the Underlying Litigation for over $37 million in compensatory damages, plus $12 million in costs and interest. As a result, USIC claims that ATM negligently handled the insurance claim and failed to settle the Underlying Litigation within the insurance policy’s $1 million limit, which exposed USIC and its reinsurer to a nearly $50 million jury verdict, as well as claims for extra-contractual liability and bad-faith from the Insured. On March 30, 2023, during mediation in which ATM did not participate, the Insurer (on behalf of Renaissance Reinsurance Ltd. a/k/a RenRe (the “Reinsurer”)), Alonso and the Plaintiffs agreed to a confidential settlement of all matters relating to the Underlying Litigation (the “Settlement”). Since then, USIC and the Reinsurer have notified ATM that they will pursue negligence and/or breach-of-contract claims against ATM for a substantial contribution to the Settlement. On February 5, 2024, the Reinsurer filed a lawsuit against Starwind in federal court in Fort Worth, TX. The claims against ATM in the complaint include: (i) breach of contract, (ii) implied contractual indemnity owed to the Reinsurer, and (iii) declaratory relief in the form of a judicial determination of the parties' respective rights under existing contracts. ATM and the Reinsurer are negotiating the terms for a potential early mediation of these claims. Client-Held Funds The Company administers escrow deposits representing funds received under real estate contracts and escrowed funds received under escrow agreements. In addition, the Company administers health savings account (“HSA”) and flexible spending account (“FSA”) funds. Collectively, such funds are referred to as “Client-held Funds”. Client-held Funds are held at third-party financial institutions and TFC. These funds are not considered assets of ----- ###### the Company and, therefore, are not included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. 16. Leases The balances and classification of operating lease assets and operating lease liabilities within the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 are as follows: December 31,",N/A,as_expected,2024,298

Related Party Transactions Cash Deposits The majority of the Company’s operating cash is held in depository accounts at Truist Bank, a wholly owned subsidiary of TFC. Deposits in these accounts are made under the same terms as other third-party Truist Bank deposit customers and may exceed FDIC insurance limits. All such cash is classified as Cash in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Investment income earned on these deposits was $64 million and an immaterial amount for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in investment income is driven by a movement of funds to interest-bearing accounts in 2023 to support the Company's standalone operations. Allocation of Corporate Expenses The operating results of TIH have historically been disclosed as part of the Insurance Holdings reportable segment within the Consolidated Financial Statements of TFC, enabling identification of directly attributable transactional information, functional departments and headcount. Directly attributable operating expenses were derived from activities relating to TIH functional departments and headcount. Certain additional costs, including compensation costs for corporate employees, have been allocated from TFC. The allocated costs for corporate functions included, but were not limited to, information technology, legal, finance and accounting, human resources, tax, treasury, shared facilities, and other shared services. Shared costs were allocated on a basis of revenue or headcount, as determined reasonable by both TFC and TIH. The amount of these allocations from TFC for each of the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $140 million and $114 million, respectively, ----- ###### recorded within Other operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Although it is not practicable to estimate what such costs would have been if TIH had operated as a separate entity, management believes the basis on which the expenses have been allocated to be a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided to, or the benefit received by, the Company during the periods presented. On April 3, 2023, the Company entered into a Services Agreement with TFC to support the Company's standalone operations. As part of the Services Agreement, TFC has agreed to provide various services, including banking and support services primarily related to information technology, real estate and facilities, finance, human resources, insurance and risk management, and legal and regulatory. The costs and expenses reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements were allocated on a systematic and rational basis based on the methodology mentioned above which may differ from the allocations specified in the Services Agreement. Transactions with Affiliates The Company enters into related party transactions with TFC and its subsidiaries. Related party revenue primarily consists of revenue for employee benefit services, property and casualty policy placement services, operational services provided to TFC, and interest earned on third-party Client-held Funds held in TFC bank accounts, which the Company retains as a fee for certain employee benefit services. In addition, the Company earns investment income on cash held in depository accounts at TFC. Investment income relating to these depository accounts was $64 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Refer to the Cash Deposits section above for more information. Related party revenues recorded in Commissions and fees in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for each of the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were $29 million and $18 million, respectively. The increase in related party revenues is primarily driven by interest earned on third-party Client-held Funds, as these funds were moved to interest-bearing accounts in 2023 to support the Company's standalone operations. Related party expenses were $4 million and $6 million, respectively for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, and are recorded in Other operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. These costs primarily consist of service fees for TFC bank accounts and transaction costs related to acquisitions. Related party receivables primarily consist of amounts due to the Company for employee benefit services, property and casualty policy placement services, and operational services provided to TFC. Additionally, TFC acts as the lender (and accordingly receives principal and interest payments) on the full recourse loans that were used to fund co-investment in TIH Common Units. Amounts are remitted to TIH in the month after the payments are received. Related party receivables recorded in Commissions, fees and other receivables, net in the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $13 million and $1 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase from 2022 is primarily due to an increase in interest receivable due to the movement of funds to interest-bearing accounts in 2023 to support the Company's standalone operations. Related party payables primarily consist of amounts due to TFC for third-party invoices paid on behalf of the Company, office space allocations, and referral fees. Related party payables recorded in Accounts payable and accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 were $17 million and ----- ###### $9 million, respectively. The increase from 2022 is primarily due to an increase in payables related to the Services Agreement with TFC that began in April of 2023. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2023, related party transactions included $1 million in fees associated with upfront issuance costs of the 2023 Revolving Credit Facility. Through December 31, 2023, no draws on the Revolving Credit Facility were made. Pursuant to the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility, the Company incurred commitment fees of $2 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, which were recorded within Interest in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Total accrued commitment fees of $2 million are recorded within Accounts payable and accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2023. There were no balances related to the Revolving Credit Facility in 2022. 18. Subsequent Events The Company has evaluated all subsequent events through March 21, 2024, which is the date the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements were available to be issued. There were no subsequent events which required recognition, adjustment to or disclosure in the financial statements other than disclosed in this note, as well as certain other footnotes. Reorganization In December 2023, the Company announced plans to reorganize the internal reporting of its existing Wholesale operating segment into two divisions: Wholesale and Underwriting (the “Reorganization”). The Reorganization became effective on January 1, 2024. Each of Wholesale and Underwriting will be led by a divisional Chief Executive Officer. The Wholesale division will comprise the Company's wholesale brokerage operations that are not involved in the underwriting process with insurance carrier partners. The Underwriting division will include the remainder of operations currently part of the existing Wholesale operating segment. The Reorganization will allow the Company to better serve its clients by leveraging efficiencies created from managing similar operations together. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the Reorganization on its determination of operating segments and reporting units, which may affect future financial statement disclosures as well as goodwill impairment testing. Purchase Agreement On February 20, 2024, TFC entered into an Equity Interest Purchase Agreement to sell its remaining stake in TIH (the “Transaction”) to an investor group (the “Buyer Parties”) for a purchase price that implies an enterprise value for TIH of $15.5 billion, and is expected to result in cash proceeds to TFC of approximately $10.1 billion, reflecting certain adjustments for, and subject to further adjustments for, cash, debt and debt-like items, working capital, transaction expenses and other matters. Consummation of the Transaction is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary conditions, including, among other things, the receipt of applicable regulatory approvals and the expiration or termination of applicable waiting periods. The Transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2024. Following the close of the Transaction, TIH will operate as a standalone company. ----- ###### TFC and the Buyer Parties have agreed to enter into related agreements ancillary to the Transaction that will become effective upon the consummation of the Transaction, including (i) a customary transition services agreement, (ii) a relationship marketing agreement pursuant to which TFC and TIH will agree to provide co- marketing materials and, as may be needed, business services, to the other party’s clients, (iii) one or more agreements pursuant to which TIH will continue to serve as TFC’s broker of record for the property and casualty insurance coverage for TFC, and (iv) one or more agreements pursuant to which TIH will continue to serve as the provider of employee benefits coverage for TFC and its subsidiaries. The Company is required to redeem the Preferred Units at the close of the Transaction. Further, the Company will deem a change of control as probable of occurring upon the close of the Transaction and will recognize compensation expense relating to Change of Control provisions applicable to the Phantom Profits Interests and Event-Vested Profits Interests at that time. ----- ### $2,750,000,000 ## Panther Escrow Issuer, LLC ##### to be merged with and into ## Truist Insurance Holdings, LLC # Panther Co-Issuer, Inc. ##### % Senior Secured Notes due 2031",N/A,as_expected,2024,298
