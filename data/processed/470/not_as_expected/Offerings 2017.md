The distribution of Notes in Canada is being made only in the provinces of Ontario, Quebec, Alberta
and British Columbia on a private placement basis exempt from the requirement that we prepare and
file a prospectus with the securities regulatory authorities in each province where trades of these
securities are made. Any resale of the Notes in Canada must be made under applicable securities
laws which may vary depending on the relevant jurisdiction, and which may require resales to be
made under available statutory exemptions or under a discretionary exemption granted by the
applicable Canadian securities regulatory authority. Purchasers are advised to seek legal advice prior
to any resale of the securities.

**Representations of Canadian Purchasers**
By purchasing Notes in Canada and accepting delivery of a purchase confirmation, a purchaser is
representing to us and the dealer from whom the purchase confirmation is received that:

-    the purchaser is entitled under applicable provincial securities laws to purchase the Notes
without the benefit of a prospectus qualified under those securities laws as it is an “accredited
investor” as defined under National Instrument 45-106—Prospectus Exemptions or Section
73.3(1) of the Securities Act (Ontario), as applicable,

-    the purchaser is a “permitted client” as defined in National Instrument 31-103—Registration
Requirements, Exemptions and Ongoing Registrant Obligations,

-    where required by law, the purchaser is purchasing as principal and not as agent, and

-    the purchaser has reviewed the text above under Resale Restrictions.

**Conflicts of Interest**
Canadian purchasers are hereby notified that the Initial Purchasers are relying on the exemption set
out in section 3A.3 or 3A.4, if applicable, of National Instrument 33-105—Underwriting Conflicts from
having to provide certain conflict of interest disclosure in this document.

**Statutory Rights of Action**
Securities legislation in certain provinces or territories of Canada may provide a purchaser with
remedies for rescission or damages if the offering memorandum (including any amendment thereto)
such as this document contains a misrepresentation, provided that the remedies for rescission or
damages are exercised by the purchaser within the time limit prescribed by the securities legislation
of the purchaser’s province or territory. The purchaser of these securities in Canada should refer to
any applicable provisions of the securities legislation of the purchaser’s province or territory for
particulars of these rights or consult with a legal advisor.

restated, or without complying with all legal and regulatory requirements under Spanish securities

offering memorandum is not intended for any public offer of the Notes in Spain.

**Portugal**
Neither the Offering nor this offering memorandum have been registered with the Portuguese
Securities Market Commission (Comissão do Mercado de Valores Mobiliários) and no action has
been or will be taken that would permit a public offering of any of the Notes in Portugal. Accordingly,
no Notes may be offered, sold or distributed except in circumstances that will result in compliance
with any applicable laws and regulations, in particular with articles 109, 110, 110-B and 111 of the

comply with the Directive for Notes of Foreign Borrowers of the Swiss Bankers Association. The

-----

regulated trading facility and, therefore, the documents relating to the Notes, including, but not limited

Code of Obligations and the listing rules of SIX Swiss Exchange Ltd. and corresponding prospectus
schemes annexed to the listing rules of the SIX Swiss Exchange Ltd or the listing rules of any other

made available to other persons without the Issuer’s express consent. This offering memorandum, as

# Market and Industry Data

In this offering memorandum, we rely on and refer to information regarding our business and the
market in which we operate and compete. The market, economic and industry data and forecasts
used in this offering memorandum were obtained from governmental and other publicly available
sources and independent industry publications and reports, including the DBK Report of March 2017
“Aparcamientos (Mercado Ibérico)” (the “DBK Report”). Industry publications and forecasts generally
state that the information they contain has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but
that the accuracy and completeness of such information is not guaranteed. We have not
independently verified such data and cannot guarantee its accuracy or completeness.

In some cases, there may be no readily available external information (whether from trade
associations, government bodies or other organizations) to validate market-related analyses and
estimates, requiring us to rely on our own internally developed estimates regarding the industry in
which we operate, our position in the industry, our market share and the market shares of various
industry participants based on our experience, our own investigation of market conditions and our
review of industry publications, including information made available to the public by our competitors.
Neither we nor the Initial Purchasers can assure you of the accuracy and completeness of, and take
no responsibility for, such data. Similarly, while we believe our internal estimates to be reasonable,
these estimates have not been verified by any independent sources and neither we nor the Initial
Purchasers can assure you as to their accuracy or the accuracy of the underlying assumptions used
to estimate such data. Our estimates involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based
on various factors. See “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors”.

# Presentation of Financial and Other Information

**General**
The Issuer was formed as a private limited liability company (société à responabilité limitée), under
the laws of Luxembourg on September 26, 2017. The Issuer is a special purpose financing vehicle
formed for the purposes of facilitating the Offering. Consequently, no historical financial information
relating to the Issuer is available. The Issuer has not engaged in any activities other than those
related to its formation and the Transactions.

Unless otherwise indicated, the financial information presented in this offering memorandum is the
historical consolidated financial information of Empark and its subsidiaries (the “Group”). The
consolidated financial statements of the Group are prepared on the basis of a calendar year, ending
on December 31 of each year.

This offering memorandum contains:

-    the consolidated financial statements of the Group as of and for the six months ended June 30,
2017, which have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 (with comparative data for the six
months ended June 30, 2016);

-    the consolidated financial statements of the Group as of and for the year ended December 31,
2016, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and audited by Ernst & Young, S.L.,
as set forth in their auditor’s report included elsewhere herein (with comparative data for the
year ended December 31, 2015); and

-    the consolidated financial statements of the Group as of and for the year ended December 31,
2015, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and audited by Ernst & Young, S.L.,
as set forth in their auditor’s report included elsewhere herein (with comparative data for the
year ended December 31, 2014).

The financial information presented herein as of and for the twelve months ended June 30, 2017 is
derived from the Group’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the six months ended
June 30, 2017 and the Group’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2016 (in each case included elsewhere herein) by adding together the financial
information for the year ended December 31, 2016 and the financial information for the six months
ended June 30, 2017 and then subtracting the financial information for the six months ended June
30, 2016.

**Pro Forma Financial Information**
This offering memorandum includes unaudited consolidated pro forma financial data which has been
adjusted to reflect certain effects of the Transactions on the financial position and net financial
expenses of the Group as of and for the twelve months ended June 30, 2017. The unaudited
consolidated pro forma financial data has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and does not
purport to represent what the actual consolidated financial position or net financial expenses of the
Group would have been if the Transactions had occurred (i) on June 30, 2017 for the purposes of the
calculation of net financial position and (ii) on July 1, 2016 for the purposes of the calculation of net
financial expenses, nor do they purport to project the Group’s consolidated financial position and net
financial expenses at any future date. The unaudited pro forma adjustments and the unaudited
_pro forma financial data set out in this offering memorandum are not accounting measures within the_
scope of IFRS and are based on available information and certain assumptions and estimates that
we believe are reasonable and may differ materially from the actual adjusted amounts. The primary,
unaudited pro forma financial measures that are used in this offering memorandum include pro forma
cash and other equivalent liquid assets, pro forma gross debt, pro forma net debt, pro forma net
recourse debt, pro forma cash interest expense and pro forma Adjusted EBITDA. See “Summary—
_Summary Financial, Operating and Other Information—Summary Pro Forma Financial Information”._

**Non-IFRS Measures**
The financial information included in this offering memorandum includes certain financial measures
which are not accounting measures within the scope of IFRS, and may not be permitted to appear on


-----

the face of primary financial statements or footnotes thereto and may not be permitted to be included
in filings under the U.S. Securities Act. The following are the primary non-IFRS financial measures
that are used in this offering memorandum:

-    Adjusted Revenue, which we define as net turnover plus other operating income less other
non-recurrent revenue less other “one off” or non-recurring gains and losses (including gains
and losses realized from the sale of parking spaces to local residents and gains and losses
realized on the sale of parking facilities);

-    EBITDA, which we define as consolidated operating results excluding amortization of fixed
assets and provisions and losses through unrecoverable receivables;

-    Adjusted EBITDA for the Group, which we define as EBITDA adjusted for (i) non-recurring
headquarter operating expenses (including redundancy payments and other related personnel
costs), (ii) non-recurring business unit expenses, and (iii) other “one off” or non-recurring gains
and losses (including gains and losses realized from the sale of parking spaces to local
residents and gains and losses realized on the sale and acquisition of parking facilities and
equity stakes in new subsidiaries);

-    Adjusted EBITDA by business line, which we define as EBITDA for the relevant business line
_adjusted for (i) reallocation of overhead costs and non-recurring headquarter operating_
expenses, (ii) non-recurring business unit expenses (including redundancy payments and other
related personnel costs) and (iii) other “one-off” or non-recurring gains and losses (including
gains and losses realized from the sale of parking spaces to local residents and gains and
losses realized on the sale and acquisition of parking facilities);

-    EBITDA Margin, which we define as EBITDA divided by the sum of net turnover and other
operating income;

-    Adjusted EBITDA Margin, which we define as Adjusted EBITDA divided by Adjusted Revenue;

-    Free Cash Flow, which we define as Adjusted EBITDA less maintenance capital expenditure,
changes in working capital, cash taxes and other non-cash items. Other non-cash items
comprise dividends received, receipts/payments through taxation of profits, payments (IFRIC
12), and other receipts/payments;

-    Free Cash Flow Conversion, which we define as Free Cash Flow divided by Adjusted EBITDA;

-    Weighted Average Remaining Duration of our concessions, which we define as the average
period of time remaining on our concessions and contracts, weighted by the contribution each
concession has made to our Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2016;

-    Gross debt, which we define as debt from our bank loans and other borrowings, including
accrued interest and excluding unamortized debt issue costs;

-    Net debt, which we define as Gross debt less Cash and other equivalent liquid assets;

-    Recourse cash and other equivalent liquid assets, which we define as Cash and other
equivalent liquid assets held by all members of the Group excluding the Non-Recourse Entities;

-    Non-recourse cash and other equivalent liquid assets, which we define as Cash and other
equivalent liquid assets held by the Non-Recourse Entities;

-    Gross recourse debt, which we define as Gross debt excluding debt of the Non-Recourse
Entities;

-    Gross non-recourse debt, which we define as debt of the Non-Recourse Entities, including
accrued interest and excluding unamortized debt issue costs;

-    Net recourse debt, which we define as Gross recourse debt less Recourse cash and other
equivalent liquid assets; and

-    Net non-recourse debt, which we define as Gross non-recourse debt less Non-recourse cash
and other equivalent liquid assets.


-----

See “Summary—Summary Financial, Operating and Other Information” and “Management’s
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation” for further information_
about and the calculation of these non-IFRS financial measures.

You should exercise caution in comparing any of the above non-IFRS financial measures as reported
by us to corresponding measures of other companies. The EBITDA measures presented in this
offering memorandum differ from the definition of “Consolidated EBITDA” set forth under the caption
“Description of Notes—Certain Definitions”. By eliminating potential differences between periods or
companies caused by factors such as depreciation and amortization methods, financing and capital
structures and taxation positions or regimes, we believe these non-IFRS financial measures can
provide a useful additional basis for comparing the current performance of the underlying operations
being evaluated. For these reasons, we believe these non-IFRS financial measures and similar
measures are regularly used by the investment community as a means of comparing companies in
our industry.

Our management also uses the non-IFRS financial measures described above to assess our
operating and financial performance and to make decisions about allocating resources in our
business. For example, management monitors the Weighted Average Remaining Duration for our
concessions in order to evaluate future cash flow variability and any associated risk.

None of the non-IFRS financial measures presented herein are a measurement of performance under
IFRS and they should not be considered in isolation or construed as a substitute for (a) operating
profit or profit for the period (as determined in accordance with IFRS) as a measure of our operating
performance, (b) cash flow from operating, investment and financing activities as a measure of our
ability to meet our cash needs or (c) any other measures of performance or liquidity.

The non-IFRS financial measures presented herein have limitations as analytical tools, including the
following:

-    they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures,
contractual commitments or working capital;

-    they do not reflect the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to
service interest or principal payments on our debts;

-    although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated
and amortized will often need to be replaced in the future, and the non-IFRS financial
measures do not reflect any cash requirements that would be required for such replacements;

-    some of the exceptional items that we eliminate in calculating the relevant non-IFRS financial
measures reflect cash payments that were made, or will in the future be made;

-    other companies in our industry may calculate the non-IFRS financial measures presented
herein differently than we do, which limits their usefulness as a comparative measure; and

-    they remove the results of impairments and disposals of fixed assets which may also occur in
future periods.

Certain amounts and percentages included in this offering memorandum have been rounded.
Accordingly, in certain instances, the sum of the numbers in a column of a table may not exactly
equal the total figure for that column.

The financial information included in this offering memorandum is not intended to comply with the
applicable accounting requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and the related rules and regulations of
the SEC which would apply if the Notes were being registered with the SEC.

**Overview**
We are one of the leading concessionaires and operators of parking infrastructure in the Iberian
Peninsula, as measured by number of parking spaces and revenues. We mainly operate
underground car parks (“off-street”), as well as some parking areas on city streets (“on-street”) under
concessions and surface rights agreements from public authorities. As of June 30, 2017, our portfolio
comprised 432 contracts in 189 municipalities and other contracts with customers such as AENA and
ANA, the respective Spanish and Portuguese public airport operators, under which we manage over
522,000 parking spaces in Spain, Portugal, the United Kingdom, Andorra, France and Turkey. For the
twelve months ended June 30, 2017, our net turnover was €206.0 million, our Adjusted Revenue was
€205.7 million and our Adjusted EBITDA was €73.2 million. Our operations in Spain and Portugal,
respectively, represented 67.6% and 20.6% of our net turnover, 67.6% and 20.6% of our Adjusted
Revenue, 68.8% and 28.8% of our gross profits, 68.4% and 29.8% of our Adjusted EBITDA and
75.9% and 11.8% of our parking spaces for the twelve months ended June 30, 2017.

We have served the Iberian market since the late 1960s. We believe this has given us a “first mover”
advantage, whereby we have continually secured long-term concessions and built a portfolio of prime
parking locations in Spain and Portugal, including in city centers, airports and other high density
traffic areas, such as hospitals and business districts. Due to a variety of physical, regulatory and
other constraints such as cost of space, we believe that there is limited opportunity to develop
alternative parking options in many of these prime areas, allowing us to benefit from captive demand
with limited competition.

We generate revenues under three business lines:

-    Off-street concessions. Our off-street concession business primarily comprises long-term
concessions, with contract lengths generally ranging from 20 years to 50 years, granted by
municipalities to develop and operate underground or multi-story parking facilities, and
represented 50.5% of our Adjusted Revenue, 85.8% of our Adjusted EBITDA and 60.5% of our
Adjusted EBITDA Margin for the twelve months ended June 30, 2017. Under these contracts,
we are generally required to invest in the construction of a new parking facility (a “green field”
concession) or make an upfront payment to the municipality for an existing parking facility (a
“brown field” concession). We operate each parking facility on a long-term basis and generate
our fees based on tariffs charged to car park users, as set out in the relevant concession or
surface rights agreement, which typically increase each year in line with inflation. We generally
retain all fees generated from operating the relevant parking facility and are responsible for all
expenses relating to operating and maintaining the parking facility during the term of the
concession. With respect to “brown field” concessions, we may pay an annual concession fee
to the municipality, an upfront fee or a combination of both. In addition, we sell a limited
number of parking spaces to local residents as an ancillary activity in connection with the
development of some parking facilities. As of June 30, 2017, we had 298 off-street concession
contracts (including 84 resident contracts) with 84 municipalities under which we manage
approximately 124,350 parking spaces. The Weighted Average Remaining Duration of our offstreet concessions was approximately 25 years as of June 30, 2017.

-    On-street concessions. Our on-street concession business comprises concessions, with
contract lengths generally ranging from five to 20 years, granted by municipalities to manage
meter-controlled on-street parking, and represented 33.5% of our Adjusted Revenue, 14.2% of


-----

our Adjusted EBITDA and 15.1% of our Adjusted EBITDA Margin in the twelve months ended
June 30, 2017. For these types of contracts, we typically receive fixed fees that are inflationindexed and which cover the yearly amortized amount of our initial investment and operating
costs and reasonable rate of return. In a number of concessions, the contract also includes a
variable incentive element (which may be based on a percentage of the collected meter
receipts, the number of parking spaces or certain other indicators) to align the concessionaire’s
objectives with optimizing revenue collection. As of June 30, 2017, we had 123 on-street
concession contracts (including nine tow-away contracts) with 104 municipalities under which
we manage approximately 267,000 parking spaces. The Weighted Average Remaining
Duration of our on-street concessions was approximately six years as of June 30, 2017.

-    Off-street contract management. Our off-street contract management business involves
contracts to manage parking facilities on behalf of public authorities, primarily airports, as well
as a limited number of private entities. Our off-street contract management business
represented 16.0% of our Adjusted Revenue and did not contribute to our Adjusted EBITDA in
a meaningful way in the twelve months ended June 30, 2017. As of June 30, 2017, we had 11
off-street management contracts. Under these contracts, we operate and manage parking
facilities with approximately 132,000 parking spaces on behalf of third parties in exchange for a
fixed fee. Although it is a relatively small part of our overall business, our off-street contract
management business line allows us to leverage our expertise in managing car parks to
improve our cash flow with minimal capital costs and reduced overhead costs due to our
centralized platform, improve our access to municipalities and build local market knowledge.

The following table sets out our Adjusted Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA for each of our business
lines for the periods indicated.

(1)  We define Adjusted Revenue as Net turnover plus Other operating income less Other non-recurrent revenue less Other “one
off’ or non-recurring gains and losses (including gains and losses realized from the sale of parking spaces to local residents
and gains and losses realized on the sale of parking facilities). Adjusted Revenue is a non-IFRS measure that we use to
evaluate our operating and financial performance and should not be considered as an alternative measure to accounting
measures under IFRS. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information”.

(2)  Amount reflects the adjustment for Other “one off” or non-recurring gains and losses.

(3)  For a reconciliation of total Adjusted Revenue to total Net turnover, see “Summary Financial, Operating and Other
_Information—Summary Business Line Information”._

(4)  Adjusted EBITDA by business line reflects certain reclassifications of business line information as presented in the Group’s
audited financial statements in order to separately present amounts for our off-street concession business in this offering
memorandum. Consolidated amounts are not affected by these reclassifications. We define Adjusted EBITDA by business
line as EBITDA for the relevant business line adjusted for (i) reallocation of overhead costs and non-recurring headquarter
operating expenses, (ii) non-recurring business unit expenses (including redundancy payments and other related personnel
costs) and (iii) other “one off” or non-recurring gains and losses (including gains and losses realized from the sale of parking
spaces to local residents and gains and losses realized on the sale and acquisition of parking facilities). Adjusted EBITDA
by business line is a non-IFRS measure that we use to evaluate our operating and financial performance and should not be
considered as an alternative measure to accounting measures under IFRS. See “Presentation of Financial and Other
_Information”._

_and Other Information—Summary Business Line Information”._

**Strengths**
We believe that we have several competitive advantages in the car park sector in Iberia, including our
long-term contract revenues, diversified business profile, assets with low demand risk and market
leadership. As a result of these strengths, together with the stable regulatory environment and
favorable industry dynamics, our business benefits from a high level of stability and recurring cash
flows.

**_Uniquely positioned for growth on the back of Iberia’s favorable macroeconomic trends_**
The macroeconomic environment in Spain and Portugal, our largest geographic markets in terms of
revenues, has gradually improved since 2013 and is expected to continue to improve in the
foreseeable future. The on-going macroeconomic recovery in Spain and Portugal is mainly driven by
GDP growth and a decrease in unemployment rates, with the unemployment rate in Spain expected
to be 4.5% lower in the next five years, which are the main macroeconomic factors impacting
disposable income, and therefore, retail, business traffic, petrol, and overall consumption. The car
park industry has been growing in Iberia mainly driven by this macroeconomic recovery as well as a
result of the increase in urbanization and an increase in the number of cars. The profitability of the
sector is generally improving, supported by scale efficiencies, the implementation of cost savings
programs and the utilization of innovative industry technology, among other factors. We believe that
we are well positioned to benefit from the continued improvement in the economic environment in
Iberia resulting in organic growth opportunities for us. The economic recovery in Iberia may also lead
to consolidation opportunities that provide room for further non-organic growth. We believe that
improvements in our cost savings, business activity and revenues in connection with such economic
improvement, together with our various cost efficiency initiatives, will have a positive effect on our
EBITDA.

**_Leading car park concessionaire in Iberia benefitting from scale and high barriers to_**
**_market entry_**
We are one of the leading car park concessionaires in the Iberian parking infrastructure concessions
market both by revenue and number of parking spaces. As of June 30, 2017, we managed 397,012
parking spaces in Spain, 61,897 in Portugal, 54,672 in the United Kingdom, 4,575 in Turkey, 3,258 in
France and 1,425 in Andorra. We had over 20.5 million car parking transactions in the twelve months
ended June 30, 2017, based on the number of payments made across all our car parks. In 2016, we
had a market share of approximately 16% based on revenues. Our size and growth have allowed us
to achieve significant economies of scale, and the scope of our operations, combined with the various
cost management measures we have implemented, have allowed us to maintain our Adjusted
EBITDA levels. For example, our centralized system controls and manages a substantial majority of
our off-street concessions business parking facilities from a remote location, which has allowed us to
reduce headcount and personnel costs without impacting our service quality and customer
satisfaction levels. Such efficiencies have led to significant savings in operating expenses as we
reduced the number of operators per car park by more than half. In addition, our mobile maintenance
personnel is responsible for the maintenance of several car parks within a defined geographic area,
which reduces personnel expenses and standby time. This has allowed us to reallocate personnel to
perform certain functions previously outsourced, thereby reducing our reliance on third-party service
providers. Our economies of scale enable us to be a consolidation platform for smaller Iberian
parking operations, and allow us to undertake valuable new concessions and acquisitions of smaller
players. For example, when we acquired Car Parking, S.L.U. in 2014, EMSA - Empreendimentos e
Exploração de Estacionamentos S.A. (“EMSA”) in 2015 and SIENT - Sistemas de Engenharia de
Transito, S.A. (“Sient”) in 2016, we integrated each company into our centralized system to reduce
the number of staff on site, ensured maintenance works were performed by dedicated local teams
and arranged for management services relating to human resources, tax or accounting, to be
conducted by centralized management teams. In addition, through our experienced management
team and our long-standing reputation in the industry, we have been able to develop and maintain
important relationships with the various municipalities with which we do business, thereby reducing
our dependence on any single local authority or region.


-----

We believe the upfront cost and difficulty in obtaining planning permission to build new high density
car parks in city centers, together with the favorable regulatory regime that applies to concession
agreements in Spain and Portugal as discussed under “—Stable regulatory environment with
_downside protection” below, as well as the scale required to operate car parks efficiently present_
significant barriers to entry in the car park industry. The stringent regulatory framework governing
parking concessions in Iberia reduces the risk of new competitors entering the market. For example,
due to the terms and lengths of concession contracts, competitors can be locked-out of the off-street
concessions business for long periods of time. In addition, our size provides us with the scale
required to operate a car park portfolio efficiently. For example, our scale enables us to share
resources among our car parks including maintenance and supervisory staff, as well as management
resources in respect of accounting, marketing, human resources, insurance and tax matters. The
number of our locations also gives us a commercial advantage as we are able to anticipate customer
needs across multiple locations. In addition, the high initial investment required to produce efficient IT
resources is beyond the reach of smaller competitors. Between 2014 and June 30, 2017, we invested
approximately €3.9 million in IT resources. Unlike smaller operators, we can price into our bids the
efficiencies that we can generate through our portfolio, and thus offer more attractive terms to
municipalities. Also, as there is a lack of available land in the major city centers of Iberia, there are
limited opportunities to construct new car parks, and our scale provides us with numerous
consolidation and expansion opportunities, which many smaller competitors are unable to take
advantage of.

**_High degree of diversification_**

Our business benefits from a portfolio which is highly diversified in terms of the following: number of
contracts, number of municipality clients and types of parking services we deliver. We are also diversified
through our three business lines, each of which has different risk profiles and capital requirements, but with
similar operational and managerial requirements. As of June 30, 2017, we had 432 contracts including
298 off-street concession contracts (including 84 resident contracts), 123 on-street concession contracts
(including nine tow-away contracts) and 11 off-street management contracts with customers such as
AENA, ANA, Gatwick Airport Limited (“Gatwick”) and Edinburgh Airport Limited (“Edinburgh”). Our off-street
and on-street concession contracts were granted in 189 municipalities in Iberia. Our off-street concession
business line is further diversified in terms of location, municipality, end user and type of contract (business
district, hospitals, shopping areas and tourism). We believe our limited reliance on any single contract is a
significant factor in diversifying our source of revenues and therefore reduces our cash flow volatility. While
our 10 largest off-street car parks represented approximately 12.3% of our total gross profit for the twelve
months ended June 30, 2017, our largest car park represented less than 2% of our total gross profit during
the same period. We believe our diversified business portfolio differentiates us from other infrastructure
companies, who typically rely on a smaller number of larger contracts or concessions, with a greater
concentration of risk.

**_Strategically located assets with attractive concessions and limited demand risk_**

We believe that our infrastructure portfolio is well invested. Our on-street concession and off-street contract
management businesses have low demand risk because we are generally paid a fixed fee for the services
we provide, regardless of occupancy of the car park. Although our off-street concession business is subject
to demand risk and fluctuations in volumes, we believe the prime locations of our concessions will continue
attracting car park users and ensuring stable utilization levels given our car parks are located in high traffic
areas at or within close proximity to city centers. Our business was created as a result of the acquisition of
the two historical leaders in the parking concessions market in Spain and Portugal, each with prime
concessions already in place. As a result, we were able to construct car parks in strategic locations,
including Playa de la Concha in San Sebastián, Plaza Mayor in Madrid and Camões in Lisbon, and take
advantage of the existing concessions which were located within close proximity to city centers and in high
traffic areas. Therefore, we believe that we enjoy a prime position in the relevant local area with respect to
a significant proportion of our parking facilities. Moreover, the high density of city centers together with
planning regulations make the approval process for “green field” concessions difficult, effectively limiting
the supply of parking spaces in a given area. Additionally, many of our concessions in strategic locations
have a long remaining life, such as Camões, Lisbon (34 years, 340 car spaces), Playa de la Concha, San
Sebastián (41 years, 1,274 car spaces), Joan de Borbó, Barcelona (22 years, 638 car spaces) and
Restauradores, Lisbon (30 years, 545 car spaces). The prime positions of our car parks and the difficulty in
building new car parks helps to reduce the demand risk in our off-street concession business.


-----

**_Stable regulatory environment with downside protection_**
The regulatory framework governing off-street and on-street parking concessions in Spain and
Portugal affords certain protections to the concessionaire. We and other car park concessionaires
that operate in Iberia have historically benefitted from a “rebalancing” clause under the relevant
concession legislation in Spain and Portugal, which may also apply to Portuguese public surface
rights agreements. Under certain circumstances, a change in the balance of the economic terms and
conditions of the concession that is adverse to the concessionaire will trigger a right of the
concessionaire to seek compensation or a “rebalancing” mechanism, which typically results in either
an extension of the concession period, an increase in tariffs payable by users, or sometimes an
increase in the number of parking spaces managed by the concessionaire, depending on the
circumstances. This regulatory environment has proven to be stable and predictable since the
implementation of the concession system more than 50 years ago and in the past, we have been
successful in relying on such protective legislation to seek additional compensation. Additionally, the
municipalities granting concessions have an interest in the success of public car parks since they are
a source of income for the municipality and the operation of car parks satisfies a public need.

**_Highly stable business with limited maintenance capital expenditure requirements_**
For the twelve months ended June 30, 2017, 85.8% of our Adjusted EBITDA was generated by our
off-street concessions business, which had a Weighted Average Remaining Duration of approximately
25 years. Since 2014, we have achieved a Replacement Rate of approximately 235%. Our off-street
concessions business also benefits from regulated tariffs linked to inflation. Accordingly, we benefit
from a high level of recurring business and long-term visibility of cash flows, and we believe the longterm nature of our portfolio is matched by few other infrastructure companies in Spain and Portugal.
The most significant contracts in the off-street portfolio are public concession agreements, with none
or limited rent payments, which is not the case of a typical lease contract more common in other
European countries.

We have achieved a Replacement Rate of approximately 113% since 2014 with respect to our onstreet concessions business. During the same period, we achieved a Renewal Rate of approximately
71% in respect of on-street car parks we manage. In addition, we also won a number of our
competitors’ contracts and in some instances, we have successfully renewed our on-street
concessions business despite our competitors submitting more competitively priced bids than us. We
believe this is due to our superior technical competence, including the implementation of state of the
art revenue collection technology, and our wealth of industry experience.

Despite the decrease in demand and volumes within our parking facilities that we experienced during
the prior economic downturn, we were able to mitigate some of the effects through inflation-indexed
price tariffs under the majority of our off-street and on-street concessions business and off-street
contract management agreements, as well as growth in our concession portfolio and our
implementation of cost management measures. The stability of our business and the resilience of our
Adjusted EBITDA during the economic downturn are illustrated in the chart below.

**Strong operational performance – Adj. EBITDA (€mm)**

Our business model shares all the key features of infrastructure companies, such as long-term cash
flow visibility, resilient revenue generation, long-term concessions and a favorable and stable
regulatory environment with certain protections for the concessionaire in case of regulatory or
administrative change. However, unlike some other infrastructure companies (including those
operating toll roads), our car parks, once operational, require relatively low levels of maintenance


-----

capital expenditure. Our limited maintenance capital expenditures are a result of our scale and
preventive maintenance measures and low operating intensity. On average, between 2014 and 2016,
our annual total maintenance capital expenditure totaled €2.3 million, representing 1.2% of our
Adjusted Revenue during the same period and mainly relating to the requirements of our car park
contracts, including recurring maintenance works and repairs on our car park facilities to ensure that
they remain fully operational and compliant. As a result, we believe we are well positioned to benefit
from returns on these investments without the need to make significant maintenance capital
expenditures with respect to these facilities.

We benefit from attractive working capital dynamics with low levels of credit risk with respect to our
off-street concession business, since such revenues are collected from users when they exit the car
park. Our current business does not require significant investment in working capital. For example,
our off-street concessions business line generates negative working capital because our revenues
are generally collected when earned and our costs are paid according to standard payment terms as
agreed in each of our contracts. However, our on-street and contract management businesses have
higher working capital requirements as they are more dependent on the payment terms from
contracts with public bodies. In addition, our credit risk with respect to our on-street concessions
business is primarily with the municipalities rather than private third parties. As a result of our low
maintenance capital expenditures and working capital requirements, we have achieved significant
Free Cash Flow Conversion ratios of 87.1% and 91.3% for the year ended December 31, 2016 and
the twelve months ended June 30, 2017, respectively.

Any larger capital expenditures are primarily related to the expansion of our business, including new
acquisitions and grants of new contracts and concessions. We are constantly securing new contracts
and concessions as existing contracts and concessions expire. These are based on our analysis of
investment opportunities and are typically not linked to prior commitments. Capital expenditures
linked to the expansion of the business depend upon specific requirements from newly awarded
contracts. For example, in 2016 our capital expenditures included the impact of the acquisition of the
remaining 50% stake in each of Alhóndiga, Aparcamientos de Bilbao, EMSA and Sient (€9.6 million);
the new on-street contract in Porto, Portugal (€9.7 million) and off-street concessions business capital
expenditures related to Parque Brasilia and Infanto Santo in Portugal, and Hospital Ramón y Cajal, El
Ejido and Las Terrazas de Marbella in Spain (approximately €11.1 million). Additional capital
expenditures may be required in connection with the renewal of on-street contracts nearing their
maturity date. Our limited maintenance capital expenditure requirements and high Free Cash Flow
Conversion ratios are illustrated by the charts below.

(1)  Maintenance capital expenditure mainly relates to car park contract maintenance requirements (mainly recurring
maintenance works and repairs on car park facilities to ensure they remain fully operational and compliant) prior to
termination of the concessions to operate such car parks but excludes the initial investment made under such contract.

(2)  Renewal capital expenditure relates to on-street investments which are required in concessions near to their maturity date.

(3)  Growth capital expenditure relates to new contracts added to the portfolio, namely a concession acquisition or an investment
made in newly awarded contracts.

(4)  M&A capital expenditure relates to new contracts added to the portfolio where we have acquired the share capital of the
company and not the asset itself.

(5)  Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow Conversion are non-IFRS measures. See “Presentation of Financial Information”. In
2014, our Free Cash Flow Conversion ratio was negatively impacted by a €19.7 million change in working capital, mainly
due to one-off payments relating to our refinancing and the commencement of significant off-street and on-street contracts.

(6)  Leverage is defined as Net debt divided by Adjusted EBITDA for the periods indicated.

**_Experienced management team with strong, supportive shareholders_**
Our senior management team has significant experience and understanding of the car park sector
and has an average of 14 years of experience in the industry and 12 years of experience with the
Company. Our senior management team has consistently over performed on budget targets, through
the successful integration of our businesses and significant cost savings achievements. This over
performance can also be attributed to the senior management team’s ability to anticipate and
embrace new trends and technology in the car park sector, which has enabled us to be a pioneer in
the deployment of efficient improvement programs and user friendly applications, such as electronic
payment devices, license plate recognition systems and mobile applications.

In addition, our senior management team maintains strong and long-standing local relationships with
the relevant regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate.

We also expect to derive further benefit from the experience and financial support of the Macquarie
Group following the completion of the Acquisition. The Macquarie Group, through its MIRA division, is
the world’s largest infrastructure manager by assets under management, according to IPE Real
Estate, and a global leader in the creation and management of specialist funds which focus on
infrastructure, real estate and adjacent sectors. As of March 31, 2017, MIRA has more than
€110 billion of assets under management. MIRA’s European investment portfolio includes businesses
located in Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia,
Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom.

**Strategy**
Our key strategies are the following:

**_Maintain focus on growing revenue and improving EBITDA_**
We will continue to implement measures designed to increase our revenues and thus enhance our
EBITDA and cash flows. Generally, under our concession agreements, we are subject to limitations
with respect to the maximum tariff that we can charge users of our parking facilities. As a result, we
have the flexibility to structure our pricing policy as we deem fit so long as we do not exceed the
maximum tariffs set forth in the concession agreement. Our pricing policy varies on a case by case
basis, and we may use any or all of the following pricing mechanics in order to maximize demand
and volumes: (i) season tickets, whereby we can offer a range of different products to fit our
customers’ specific needs (for example, offering specific time slots on specific days or for specific
periods of time), which can help to increase volumes during those times of the day when rotation is
less intensive, as well as have a positive impact on our working capital as a result of receiving
payments in advance, (ii) different tariff structures, whereby tariffs will differ, for example, based on
the time of day or the day of the week, and (iii) long-dated sales, whereby we can expand our product
and service offering by developing special offers and promotions designed in partnership with third
parties, such as travel agencies in connection with holiday packages or special events.

We also seek to increase revenue and volumes within our off-street concessions business parking
facilities through increased deployment of car park signage and other forms of advertising in city
centers and other high traffic areas in which our car parks are located. In addition, we anticipate that
revenues from our large parking facilities opened in the past three years will increase over the
coming years as they are currently in the “ramp up” phase. Within our on-street concession business,
we seek to continue improving our revenue collection through the implementation of best practices,
such as our integrated platform for payment (Telpark) and visual car enforcement in order to increase
revenues collected for the relevant municipality, which will thereby increase the level of variable
incentive compensation we receive under such concession. Moreover, we intend to continue to
implement technological improvements to achieve greater efficiency, which will allow us to more
efficiently manage the parking areas covered by our on-street concessions business and increase the
number of parking spaces covered per employee. For example, we plan on increasing the number of
car parks, both from our existing portfolio and new acquisitions that will be connected to our
centralized control room in order to reduce fixed costs. Upon completion of the Acquisition, we aim to
realize further net cost savings of approximately €2.3 million consisting of overhead cost savings of
approximately €3.3 million relating to the departure of top management, partially offset by €1.0 million
in additional costs we expect to incur for the appointment of a new chief executive officer and new
chief financial officer. For further information, see “Management—Empark—Transitional Services
_Agreements”._

**_Maintain our disciplined and high operational efficiency_**
We will continue to focus on managing our business in a cost-efficient manner by using the latest
industry technologies and improving customer service. We will also continue to work with car
manufacturers to implement new technology systems. In the past, we have invested in and installed
several user-friendly IT applications to enhance the customer experience at our car parks including
electronic payment devices such as Via Verde, license plate recognition systems and mobile
applications, such as Telpark, for both off-street and on-street car parking. We plan to continue to
improve and extend the application of our cost-effective practices, such as monthly contract-bycontract cost base reviews, the centralization of the daily management of our off-street concessions
business car parks from a remote location, our energy efficiency programs and our on-street
efficiency programs. Furthermore we will continue to maintain our well invested assets in order to
keep our required level of maintenance capital expenditure low, and we plan to eliminate certain
overhead costs not required for continued operations.

**_Preserve and selectively expand our high quality portfolio of long-term concessions_**
We have a diversified portfolio of concessions and contracts in prime locations and will strive to
maintain and renew these concessions and contracts in order to maintain our stable cash flow
generation. We believe our infrastructure is well-invested. The total expansionary capital expenditure
for the period from 2014 to 2016 was €57.5 million. As a result, we intend to focus our efforts on


-----

renewing our portfolio of existing concessions and contracts by maintaining our well invested assets
in anticipation of future renewal capital expenditure requirements and organically expanding our
operations by capturing new concessions and contracts. For example, due to our market leading
position, scale and expertise, we believe that we are well positioned to continue to grow our
diversified portfolio by renewing our existing contracts and concessions and capturing new contracts
and concessions from both existing customers seeking to award new concessions and from other
organizations looking to outsource the management of their parking facilities. For example, in line
with our historical strategy, we may acquire high quality smaller car parks in prime locations and to
incorporate them into our centralized control room, which will increase our portfolio of assets that
benefit from our mobile maintenance personnel. Due to our scale, long-standing experience in this
industry and established relationships with municipalities, we are able to achieve significant synergies
that also allow us to offer more competitive terms than those offered by our competitors. We believe
our position as one of the leading concessionaires of off-street concessions and on-street
concessions parking in Iberia, combined with our long-standing relationships with a diverse number of
local authorities and favorable industry dynamics, including high barriers to entry, will assist us in
continuing to implement this strategy.

**_Strategic focus on off-street concessions business in Iberia_**
We will continue to focus on managing our core business segments within Iberia, principally the offstreet segment. We may opportunistically consider dispositions of non-core operations and
geographies, in order to enhance the risk profile of investment capital expenditures and improve
profitability. In addition, as part of our long-term strategy, we may consider strategic options regarding
the on-street concession business line, off-street contract management and business outside of Iberia
in order to fully focus on our off-street concession business, which has a higher EBITDA Margin.

**History and Ownership**
We commenced our operations in Iberia under the name Cintra Parking (the name of Empark prior to
its acquisition of Emparque) in Spain in the 1960s. Emparque commenced operations in Portugal in
the 1970s.

Over the last five decades, our business has expanded through a combination of organic growth and
a series of mergers and acquisitions. The growth culminated in July 2009, when the Group was
created following a series of transactions whereby Cintra Parking acquired and merged with
Emparque. Since then, we have expanded our operations with a sustained focus on Iberia.

We are now in the process of being acquired by the Sponsor. We expect this acquisition to be
completed on the Completion Date. See “The Transactions”.

**Principal Shareholder**

Upon completion of the Acquisition on the Completion Date, the Group, will be indirectly owned by the
Sponsor which is managed by MIRAEL, a member of the Macquarie Group. The Macquarie Group,
through its MIRA division, is the world’s largest infrastructure manager by assets under management,
according to IPE Real Estate, and a global leader in the creation and management of specialist funds
which focus on infrastructure, real estate and adjacent sectors. As of March 31, 2017, MIRA has more than
€110 billion of assets under management. MIRA’s European investment portfolio includes businesses
located in Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Spain,
Sweden and the United Kingdom. MIRA takes a partnership approach, working with local management
teams and bringing specialist strategic, commercial, operational and financial expertise through its global
team of operations and industry experts. Globally, MIRA actively manages 46 funds and mandates across
infrastructure, real estate, agriculture and energy, which have been invested in over 200 infrastructure
businesses. In Europe, MIRA has to date raised and invested through five dedicated European
infrastructure funds with commitments totalling over €14 billion.

**The Transactions**

**_The Acquisition_**
On July 28, 2017, Bidco, an entity formed by the Sponsor for purposes of facilitating the Acquisition,
entered into a sale and purchase agreement (the “Acquisition Agreement”) with the Sellers to acquire
all the issued and outstanding share capital of the Target from the Sellers. The cash consideration for
the Acquisition, together with the Debt Repayment and estimated transaction fees and expenses, is
expected to be in aggregate €942.5 million. Completion of the Acquisition is expected to occur in
December 2017. If the actions to be undertaken at the scheduled date of consummation of the
transaction are not conducted (and not remedied within the relevant time periods provided therefore),
the Acquisition Agreement may be terminated by the non-breaching party.

**_The Financing and Completion Date Transactions_**
The financing in connection with the Acquisition consists of (i) an indirect cash contribution by the
Sponsor in the amount of €467.5 million, and (ii) the gross proceeds from the issuance of the Notes
in the amount of €475.0 million (assuming the Notes are issued at par), which together will be used to
finance (i) the payment of cash consideration for the Acquisition to the Sellers in the amount of
€486.0 million, (ii) the Debt Repayment at the Target Group in the amount of €424.0 million, and (iii)
€32.5 million in related fees and expenses, including fees and expenses incurred in connection with
the Offering. See “The Transactions—The Financing and Completion Date Transactions” and “Use of
_Proceeds”._

_Release of proceeds from escrow_
Pending the completion of the Acquisition, the gross proceeds of the Offering will be deposited into
the Escrow Account in the name of the Issuer but controlled by, and pledged on a first-ranking basis
in favor of, the Trustee, on behalf of the holders of the Notes, pursuant to the Escrow Agreement. The
release of the escrow proceeds will be subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including the
completion of the Acquisition. See “Description of Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory
_Redemption”. If the Acquisition is not completed on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date, or upon the_
occurrence of certain other events, then all of the Notes will be subject to a special mandatory
redemption. The special mandatory redemption price will be equal to 100% of the initial issue price of
the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, from the Issue Date up to,
but not including, the payment date of such special mandatory redemption. See “Description of
_Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption”._

_Use of Proceeds_
We estimate that the gross proceeds from the Offering will be €475.0 million. Upon release from
escrow, the net proceeds from the Offering will be on lent by the Issuer to Bidco by (i) the Debt
Repayment Proceeds Loan to finance the Debt Repayment; and (ii) the Acquisition and Fees
Proceeds Loan to finance a portion of the cash purchase price of the Acquisition and to pay related
fees and expenses.

_Sources and uses_
The expected estimated sources and uses of the funds necessary to consummate the Transactions,
including the proceeds of the Offering after the Escrow Release are shown in the table below. Actual
amounts will vary from estimated amounts depending on several factors, including differences from
our estimate of existing cash in the business, our estimates of the cost of repaying the existing
indebtedness described below, differences from our estimates of costs and expenses and the
ultimate timing of the Completion Date.

**The Issuer**
The Issuer was incorporated as a private liability company (société à responsabilité limitée) on
September 26, 2017 under the name “Arena Luxembourg Finance S.à r.l.” under the laws of the
Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and in the process of being registered with the Luxembourg Register of
Commerce and companies. Its registered office is located at 46, Place Guillaume II, L-1648
Luxembourg, Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. The Issuer is a special purpose financing vehicle formed
for the purposes of the Acquisition and prior to the date hereof has not engaged in any activities other
than those related to its formation and the Transactions.

**Recent Developments**

**_Trading update_**
Based on preliminary management accounts for July and August 2017, we estimate that our Adjusted
EBITDA experienced growth in the range of 4% and 5% compared to the same period in 2016. This
growth is in line with the trend observed in the six months ended June 30, 2017. During the same
period our off-street like-for-like revenues experienced growth in the range of 4% and 5% compared
to the same period in 2016.

Since September 2013, we have experienced consistent, positive growth in our off-street like-for-like
revenues with the volume of transactions returning to the levels that existed prior to the economic
downturn in Iberia. Accordingly, we believe that we are well positioned to continue to benefit from a
sustained economic recovery in the Iberian Peninsula.

We use like-for-like revenues to provide a comparison between all net turnover and other operating
income generated under our off-street concession business line during a specified month in the
current year and all net turnover and other operating income generated under our off-street
concession business line during the same month for the prior year, as adjusted to eliminate any new
concessions and any concessions that expired or were terminated during the periods being
compared. Accordingly, if an off-street concession was being managed in 2016, but is no longer
managed in 2017, the net turnover and other operating income generated under that concession in
2016 is not included for purposes of this comparison.

We have not yet finalized our financial or operating data for certain of the periods discussed above.
Accordingly, the above information is not intended to be a comprehensive statement of our financial
or operating results for the relevant period. The preliminary estimates above were prepared based on
a number of assumptions and estimates that are subject to inherent uncertainties and subject to
change. Accordingly, our actual results for the relevant period may vary from our unaudited
preliminary estimates above, and such variations could be material. See “Forward-Looking
_Statements” and “Risk Factors” for a more complete discussion of certain of the factors that could_
affect our future performance and results of operations.

under the Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties to certain priority hedging obligations have been paid in full. See

case, to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (and the Agreed
Security Principles) and the requirements set forth in such Security
and Guarantee Documents, as soon as practicable and in any

_Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”._

On the Issue Date, the Issuer will instruct the Initial Purchasers

proceeds are insufficient to pay the special mandatory price,
the Sponsor will be required to provide funds to the Issuer in
an amount required to enable the Issuer to pay such accrued
and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any owing to the
holders of the Notes, pursuant to an agreement between the
Sponsor and the Issuer.


**Intercreditor Agreement.................. The Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging obligations**
will also be secured by first-ranking security interests in the
Collateral. In addition, the Indenture will permit certain other
indebtedness to be secured by security interests in the
Collateral. The lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility and
the holders of certain hedging obligations will receive priority
with respect to the distribution of the proceeds of the Collateral
in the event of an enforcement of the security interests over the
Collateral. The intercreditor relationships among the lenders
under the Revolving Credit Facility, the holders of the Notes
and the holders of certain other indebtedness (including
hedging counterparties) will be governed by the Intercreditor
Agreement. See “Description of Certain Financing

certain preferred stock;

                         - create or incur certain liens;

                         - make certain payments, including dividends or other
distributions, with respect to the shares of the Parent
Guarantor;

                         - prepay or redeem subordinated debt or equity;

                         - make certain investments;

                         - create encumbrances or restrictions on the payment of

Each of these covenants is subject to significant exceptions
and qualifications. See “Description of Notes—Certain
_Covenants”._

**Additional Amounts ........................ All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any of the**
Guarantors under or with respect to the Notes or any Note
Guarantee will be made free and clear of and without
withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any present or
future Taxes unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes
is then required by law. If any deduction or withholding for, or
on account of, any such Taxes will at any time be required to
be made, the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will, subject to
certain exceptions, pay the additional amounts necessary so
that the net amount received by the holders of the relevant
Notes after the deduction or withholding will equal the
respective amounts that would have been received in respect
of such payments in the absence of such withholding or
deduction. See “Description of Notes—Additional Amounts”.

**Denominations................................. The Notes will be issued in registered form and transferable in**
minimum denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of
€1,000 in excess thereof.

U.S. Securities Act or the securities laws of any other
jurisdiction. The Notes are subject to restrictions on
transferability and resale. Holders of the Notes will not have the
benefit of any exchange or registration rights. See “Notice to
_Investors”._

**No Prior Market................................ The Notes will be new securities for which there is currently no**
market. Although the Initial Purchasers have informed the
Issuer that they intend to make a market in the Notes, they are
not obligated to do so and may discontinue market-making at
any time without notice. Accordingly, there can be no


-----

assurance that a liquid market for the Notes will develop or be
maintained.

**Listing** ............................................... Application will be made for listing particulars to be approved
by the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and for the Notes to be
listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange
and admitted to trading on the Euro MTF market. There can be
no assurance that the Notes will be, or will remain, so listed
and admitted to trading on the Euro MTF market.

**Use of Proceeds .............................. We will use the gross proceeds of the Notes as set forth in**
“Use of Proceeds”.

the laws of the State of New York. The Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement will be governed by, and construed in accordance
with, English law except that certain provisions of the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement will be interpreted in accordance with
New York law. The Security and Guarantee Documents
creating security interests over the Collateral will be governed

# Summary Financial, Operating and Other Information

The following tables set forth summary historical consolidated financial, operating and other
information of the Group as of and for the periods indicated.

The summary historical consolidated financial information presented below for the Group (except for
the footnotes included below the tables and except as otherwise indicated) (1) as of and for the years
ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016, have been derived from the audited consolidated
financial statements of the Group as of and for each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and
2016, as prepared in accordance with IFRS and included elsewhere in this offering memorandum,
and (2) as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2017, have been derived from the
unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Group as of and for the six months ended
June 30, 2017, as prepared in accordance with IAS 34 and included elsewhere in this offering
memorandum.

The financial information presented herein as of and for the twelve months ended June 30, 2017
is derived from the Group’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the six months ended
June 30, 2017 and the Group’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2016 (in each case included elsewhere herein) by adding together the financial
information for the year ended December 31, 2016 and the financial information for the six
months ended June 30, 2017 and then subtracting the financial information for the six months
ended June 30, 2016.

The summary historical consolidated financial information presented below includes certain non-IFRS
measures that we use to evaluate our operating and financial performance. These measures are not
identified as accounting measures under IFRS and therefore should not be considered as alternative
measures to evaluate the performance of the Group. See “Presentation of Financial and Other
_Information”._

The summary unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information presented below has been
adjusted to reflect certain effects of the Transactions on the financial position and net financial
expenses of the Group as of and for the twelve months ended June 30, 2017. The summary
unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information has been prepared for illustrative purposes
only and does not purport to represent what the actual consolidated financial position or net financial
expenses of the Group would have been if the Transactions had occurred (i) on June 30, 2017 for the
purposes of the calculation of net financial position and (ii) on July 1, 2017 for the purposes of the
calculation of net financial expenses, nor does such summary unaudited pro forma consolidated
financial information purport to project the Group’s consolidated financial position and net financial
expenses at any future date or for any future period. The summary unaudited pro forma consolidated
financial information presented below includes non-IFRS measures and is based on available
information and certain assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable and may differ
materially from the actual amounts.

The results of operations for the interim periods or prior years are not necessarily indicative of the
results to be expected for the full year or any future period or our financial condition at any future
date. The following summary historical consolidated financial, operating and other information should
be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, the consolidated financial
statements of the Group and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this offering
memorandum, and should also be read together with the information set forth under the headings
“Presentation of Financial and Other Information”, “Use of Proceeds”, “Capitalization”, “Selected
_Historical Consolidated Financial Information”, “Business” and “Management’s Discussion and_
_Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”._

(2)  We define EBITDA Margin as EBITDA divided by the sum of Net turnover and Other operating income.

(3)  We define Adjusted EBITDA for the Group as EBITDA adjusted for (i) Non-recurring headquarter operating expenses
(including redundancy payments and other related personnel costs), (ii) Non-recurring business unit expenses and (iii)
Other “one-off” or non-recurring gains and losses (including gains and losses realized from the sale of parking spaces to
local residents and gains and losses realized on the sale and acquisition of parking facilities and equity stakes in new
subsidiaries). Gains and losses realized on acquisitions could include negative goodwill which could have an impact on
our income statement. Adjusted EBITDA for the Group is a non-IFRS measure that we use to evaluate our operating and
financial performance and should not be considered as an alternative measure to accounting measures under IFRS.

(a)  Represents non-recurring overhead costs, such as redundancy payments and other one-off costs. In the six months
ended June 30, 2017, we incurred costs relating to corporate studies and financing consultations. In the year ended
December 31, 2016, we incurred €0.9 million non-recurring expenses in corporate studies and consultations and €0.4
million in other expenses that are “one off” or considered non-recurring by the Group. In the year ended December
31, 2015, we incurred €0.2 million in redundancy payments and €0.2 million in other expenses that are “one off” or
considered non-recurring by the Group. In the year ended December 31, 2014, we incurred €1.0 million in nonrecurring fees and expenses in connection with the issuance of our Existing Notes and severance payments.

(b)  Represents redundancy payments and other related one-off personnel costs in our business units, payments arising
under or in connection with judicial awards or legal judgments, indemnity payments and other expenses that are “one
off” or considered non-recurring by the Group. In the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we incurred nonrecurring expenses mainly relating to severance payments. In the year ended December 31, 2014, we incurred €2.7
million in non-recurring business unit expenses mainly relating to redundancy payments, in part offset by savings
associated with those redundancies.

(c)  Represents gains and losses from the sale of parking spaces to local residents, gains and losses recognized on the
sale of parking facilities, fees or other payments arising in connection with our early termination or cancellation of
concessions and other contracts and other gains and losses that are “one off” or considered non-recurring by the
Group. The amount in 2014 represents a “one-off” gain of €12.8 million, mainly relating to a profit resulting from the
disposal of the Sevilla car park in Madrid.

(d)  Excludes a pro forma adjustment of €0.5 million relating to the acquisitions of Car Parking, S.L.U. and I Más D
Parking, S.L.U., which were consolidated into the Group in August 2014. If we account for the pro forma full-year
impact of the acquisitions in 2014, our Adjusted EBITDA amounts to €65.9 million.

(4)  We define Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by Adjusted Revenue.

(5)  We define Recourse Adjusted EBITDA as Adjusted EBITDA for the Group excluding EBITDA generated by the NonRecourse Entities.


-----

(6)  We define Non-recourse Adjusted EBITDA as Adjusted EBITDA for the Group generated by the Non-Recourse Entities.

(7)  We define Adjusted Revenue as Net turnover plus Other operating income less Other non-recurrent revenue less Other
“one off’ or non-recurring gains and losses (including gains and losses realized from the sale of parking spaces to local
residents and gains and losses realized on the sale of parking facilities). Adjusted Revenue is a non-IFRS measure that
we use to evaluate our operating and financial performance and should not be considered as an alternative measure to
accounting measures under IFRS. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information”.

(a)  Changes in working capital for the year ended December 31, 2014 were driven mainly by non-recurrent items such
as the payment of costs relating to the issue of our Existing Notes (€5.1 million, which were provisioned but not paid
at year end), one-off payments in connection with the car park resident spaces business (€1.4 million), payments
linked to contract terminations which were accounted for at the end of 2013 but were not yet paid and working capital
movements linked to ordinary course of business.

(9)  Free Cash Flow Conversion is a non-IFRS performance measure and Free Cash Flow divided by Adjusted EBITDA.

(9)  Adjusted EBITDA by business line reflects certain reclassifications of business line information as presented in the
Group’s audited financial statements in order to separately present amounts for our off-street concession business in this
offering memorandum. Consolidated amounts are not affected by these reclassifications.

We define Adjusted EBITDA by business line as EBITDA for the relevant business line adjusted for (i) Reallocation of
overhead costs and non-recurring headquarter operating expenses, (ii) Non-recurring business unit expenses (including
redundancy payments and other related personnel costs) and (iii) Other “one off” or non-recurring gains and losses
(including gains and losses realized from the sale of parking spaces to local residents and gains and losses realized on
the sale and acquisition of parking facilities). Adjusted EBITDA by business line is a non-IFRS measure that we use to
evaluate our operating and financial performance and should not be considered as an alternative measure to accounting

# Risk Factors

_An investment in the Notes involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following_
_risks, together with other information provided to you in this offering memorandum, in deciding_
_whether to invest in the Notes. The occurrence of any of the events discussed below could materially_
_adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. If these events occur, the_
_trading prices of the Notes could decline, and we may not be able to pay all or part of the interest or_
_principal on the Notes, and you may lose all or part of your investment. Additional risks not currently_
_known to us or that we now deem immaterial could also adversely affect our business, results of_
_operations, or financial condition or our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and affect your_
_investment._

_This offering memorandum contains “forward-looking” statements that involve risks and uncertainties._
_Our actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking_
_statements. Factors that might cause such differences include those discussed below and elsewhere_
_in this offering memorandum. See “Forward-Looking Statements”._

**Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry**

**_We are subject to intense competition that can constrain our ability to win, renew and acquire_**
**_parking concessions, as well as, in some instances reduced volumes of concessions being_**
**_tendered, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, results of_**
**_operations or financial condition._**
Our principal business activity is the development and management of off-street parking concessions,
primarily in Spain and Portugal. We also manage on-street parking concessions for municipalities
and, to a lesser extent, operate our off-street contract management business, which involves
contracts to manage parking lots on behalf of public authorities, primarily airports and hospitals, and a
limited number of private entities. The off-street and on-street parking concession sector in Spain and
Portugal is a highly competitive market, with a variety of competitors ranging from small, local
single-concession operators to large, regional, national and international operators with a significant
number of concessions. Some of these larger competitors are divisions of diversified global
corporations with substantial financial, management and other resources and capabilities.

In Spain and Portugal, concessions for parking facilities are generally awarded and renewed through
competitive tenders. In the bidding phase of a concession, a significant number of competing bidders
may participate, including large construction groups and financial investors. Generally, public tenders
for off-street concessions and off-street contract management are the most competitive, focusing
primarily on economics. Public tenders for on-street concessions tend to be less competitive, given
the limited number of potential operators, and tend to focus on the technical specifications of the
concession and the demonstrated experience of the bidder. There also may be significant competition
to renew existing concessions. For example, between January 1, 2014 and June 30, 2017, we had
an average Renewal Rate of approximately 36% of total off-street concessions and 71% of total
on-street concessions. The Renewal Rate of off-street concessions was in part due to certain city
councils, primarily the City Council in Madrid, not retendering the concession at expiry as further
discussed below. This intense competition also materializes in a significant number of challenges by
non-awarded bidders in relation to the granting of car parks. We may lose bids where we do not want
to lower our return expectations or where a competitor may operate the concession more efficiently
(for example, if it manages other car parks nearby). If we are unable to compete successfully in the
future, our Renewal Rates may decline. In addition, there is intense competition in Spain and
Portugal to acquire any concessions that may be available for sale by their existing holders or owners
(or to acquire concession operators). Certain competitors may have greater financial resources and
lower cost bases than we have. Consequently, they may be able to bid more competitively than we
can in public tenders for concessions or may be able to offer more commercially favorable terms than
us. As a result of such competition, we may not be able to win new concessions or renew existing
concessions on commercially favorable terms, which are consistent with those we have negotiated in
the past, or at all. In addition, certain city councils, such as the City Council in Madrid, may choose
not to retender a car park once it has expired, but rather, operate the car parks themselves, resulting
in increased competition for other car parks. Our inability to successfully compete to win new


-----

concessions or to retain existing concessions could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations or financial condition.

**_We are dependent on the macroeconomic environment._**
Our operations are principally located in Europe, and in particular in Spain and Portugal, which for the
twelve months ended June 30, 2017 collectively accounted for 88.2% of our net turnover and 98.3%
of our EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2016. Accordingly, our financial performance is
particularly affected by economic and financial conditions in Spain and Portugal, and our results of
operations may be adversely affected if difficult macroeconomic circumstances in Spain and Portugal
cause a sustained or significant decrease in the demand for parking services.

The EU as a whole is an important market for our business, and adverse economic effects within the
EU could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
Conditions in Europe have resulted in increased volatility in global capital markets, which could
continue for the foreseeable future. The increased volatility may result in a reduction in automobile
travel of a discretionary nature, which could adversely impact traffic levels in a number of locations
where we operate parking facilities.

Continuing or renewed instability in the European markets, the stability of the euro or the EU and the
uncertainty derived from the refugee crisis has contributed to weak European economic performance.
Future developments may continue to be dependent upon a number of political and economic factors.

Concerns persist regarding the debt burden of certain European countries and their ability to meet
future financial obligations, the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single
currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances in individual member states of the
Eurozone. These concerns could lead to the exit of one or more countries from the Eurozone and the
reintroduction of national currencies in the affected countries.

The UK’s decision to leave the EU has triggered a process of negotiation which will determine the
future terms of the UK’s relationship with the EU and the general elections in numerous EU countries
could lead to the exit of one or more countries from the Eurozone and other potential developments,
or market perceptions concerning this and related issues, could undermine confidence in the overall
stability of the EU, have adverse consequences for us with respect to our overall performance in the
EU and, as a result, our business, results of operation or financial condition may be materially
affected.

The Catalan government has announced and held a ballot for Catalonia’s independence on October
1, 2017, although the Spanish government did not recognize it as legitimate and the Spanish courts
consider it to be illegal. The results and the implications of the referendum are still unknown, but
could result in further political instability, which may impact our existing concessions in Catalonia
and/or our ability to conduct future business in Catalonia. Our business in Catalonia generated
approximately 6% of our revenue during the twelve months ended June 30, 2017. Changes in
Catalonia’s policy could also have adverse consequences to our business, results of our operations
or our financial condition.

**_Our concessions are granted for a limited period of time and are subject to termination by the_**
**_granting authority on public interest grounds under circumstances stipulated under public law_**
**_or under the terms and conditions contractually agreed to as well as under the circumstances_**
**_set forth under applicable private law which may also apply with respect to surface rights_**
**_agreements._**
As of June 30, 2017, we had 298 off-street concessions (including 84 resident contracts) and 123
on-street concessions (including nine tow-away contracts) granted by municipalities and private
entities. Our off-street parking concessions are typically long-term arrangements with a maximum
term of up to 50 years (although certain older contracts and surface rights agreements in Portugal,
such as Camões or Alexandre Herculano, have longer terms), and our on-street parking concessions
in some cases could have a maximum term of up to 25 years (or 20 years in Portugal). Moreover,
while these concessions are generally long-term arrangements, most of our concessions will be
subject to a public tender process at the end of their term. Out of our top 25 contracts by gross
margin, two will expire in the next two years. The loss of, or the renewal on less commercially
favorable terms of, a significant number of our existing concessions, or one or more of our largest


-----

concessions, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial
condition.

In addition, under applicable public laws, the relevant awarding authorities in Spain and Portugal may
terminate or recover concessions prior to their expiration on public interest grounds, which is subject
to interpretation, or under certain other circumstances stipulated under applicable public law, subject
to judicial review of the grounds for termination. See “Regulation—Spain—Early termination events
_and consequences” and “Regulation—Portugal—Termination of the concession”. We have_
experienced one such termination in the past six years. During 2012, the municipality in Cascais,
Portugal (a seaside resort town of approximately 35,000 inhabitants) terminated our concession over
a parking area in the municipality for public interest reasons. This concession accounted for 0.5% and
0.4% of our net turnover and Adjusted EBITDA, respectively, in 2011. We challenged the legality of
the termination of the Cascais concession and initiated a claim for compensation for our initial
investment and loss of profits which resulted in the municipality paying us a settlement payment of
€0.8 million in 2012. We are also subject to the termination rights set forth in the terms and conditions
in our agreements as well as private law which may also apply with respect to our surface rights
agreements.

Additionally, we have continued to operate a small number of our concessions past the termination
date before the contract is renewed and awarded to us or awarded to another party. If we operate the
concession beyond the term of the contract, we may have limited recourse should the municipality
terminate our services during such periods.

Generally, in the event of early termination of the concession not due to fault of the concessionaire,
the concessionaire will be entitled to compensation from the municipality for the amount of the
investments it has made in carrying out the terms of the concession based on the degree to which
the investments have been amortized. We may also seek compensation provided by law or contract
to cover our anticipated profits for the remaining duration of the concession agreements if the
awarding authority terminates the concession, although there can be no assurance that we will be
successful. Additionally, the public authority has some discretion in interpreting the terms of the
concession, especially when determining whether we have complied with its terms. If we are
unsuccessful in seeking compensation from the municipality, our only recourse may be litigation,
which may involve additional expenses and an extended period of time to reach a resolution. Even if
successful, the public authorities may not have the resources available to satisfy any claim by us for
compensation for lost investment or profit on a timely basis in the event of a future economic
downturn.

Additionally, certain of our contract management agreements allow the counterparty to remove some
parking spaces from our management without compensation for public interest reasons. While this
has not occurred in the past, if the counterparty were to exercise such a clause, our rights to contest
this action may be limited.

**_Changes in transportation and traffic patterns could materially adversely affect demand at our_**
**_facilities._**
A variety of factors are contributing to changes in the transportation industry that could have a
negative impact on our business, including changes in regulations, increased use of public transport
by end customers and car sharing, in particular in connection with our off-street concessions where
our EBITDA Margins are most affected by changes in demand, and to a lesser extent in connection
with our on-street concessions. Changes in environmental and traffic control regulations could reduce
demand for, and volumes in, our off-street parking facilities that could adversely affect our business,
results of operations or financial condition. For example, some municipalities may impose traffic
congestion charges in urban areas, reduce the availability of on-street parking spaces or promote the
use of public transportation in lieu of automobiles. Governments may also increase the tax levels on
automobiles and petroleum for environmental reasons, which may reduce traffic. We may also be
materially adversely affected by temporary or permanent changes to traffic routes or road closures,
which may make it more difficult to access our parking facilities and have a material adverse effect on
our business, results of operations or financial condition.


-----

**_Changing consumer preferences may lead to a decline in parking demand, which could have a_**
**_material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations._**
Ride sharing services such as Uber, along with the potential for driverless cars, may lead to a decline
in parking demand in cities and urban areas. While we devote considerable effort and resources to
analyze and respond to consumer preferences and changes to consumer preferences and the
markets in which we operate, consumer preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and can
change rapidly. Additionally, changes in consumer behaviors by using mobile phone applications and
on-line parking reservation services that help drivers reserve parking with garage, lots and individual
owner spaces cannot be predicted with certainty and could change current customers’ parking
preferences. If we are unable to anticipate and respond to trends in the consumer marketplace and
the industry, including but not limited to market displacement by delivery service companies, car
sharing companies and changing technologies, it could constrain our business and have a material
and adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_In any particular period in which we experience a decrease in our net turnover, our operating_**
**_expenses may not decrease at the same rate, which could have a material adverse effect on_**
**_our net cash flows, margins and profits._**
Many of the expenses associated with operating concessions are relatively fixed. These expenses
include personnel costs, interest, rent, property taxes, insurance and utilities. If we are unable to
decrease our costs significantly or rapidly when demand for our parking concessions decreases, the
decline in our net turnover can have a particularly adverse effect on our net cash flows and profits.
This effect can be especially pronounced during periods of economic contraction or slow economic
growth. Where cost cutting efforts are insufficient to offset declines in net turnover, we could
experience a material decline in margins and potentially negative cash flows which could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_In our off-street and on-street parking concessions, the tariff rates that we can charge our_**
**_customers are governed by our concession agreements._**
The net turnover that we generate from our off-street and on-street parking concessions is dependent
on our tariff rates. The tariff structure is established under our concession agreements and we
generally have limited or no ability to independently raise tariffs beyond the contractual provisions
(usually, based on the rate of inflation). Before bidding for any concession project, we conduct an
analysis to determine the conditions under which we believe such concession can be operated
profitably. If the assumptions underlying our analysis prove to be incorrect and our tariffs do not
generate sufficient revenues to cover our costs, we may be unable to increase our tariffs or reduce
our costs in order for the concession to remain profitable, which could materially adversely affect our
business, results of operations or financial condition. This effect could be compounded with respect to
our long-term concession agreements.

**_According to the Law on the De-indexation of the Spanish Economy, new concession_**
**_contracts will not include the right to increase tariffs in accordance with inflation. Tariffs may_**
**_only be increased in line with the direct cost of the services and goods provided under each_**
**_concession contract._**
The Law on the De-indexation of the Spanish Economy, approved March 30, 2015, provides new
rules for the review of monetary values in contracts awarded by public authorities and alters the past
regime that was based on the principle of said monetary values being modified by virtue of price
indexes or formulas. Instead, it takes into account only significant costs of the underlying goods and
services of the activity (such as energy costs, or labor costs when the labor force needed for the
rendering of the service is deemed significant, but only up to the increase of wages of civil servants),
in proportion to the activity’s total costs. In any event, financial costs and amortization costs, general
expenditures and structural costs, as well as tax increases, are excluded from update.

This new regulation has no retroactive effect and should not affect contracts already awarded to
Empark (nor any extension of the same) but it will affect contracts awarded after the entry into force
of the Royal Decree 55/2017, dated February 3, 2017. According to such Royal Decree, the bidding
terms and conditions of each contract will have to determine, whenever a tariff update is foreseen,
the update calculation method to be used in each case (which must be elaborated by the awarding
authority pursuant to the principles of the De-Indexation Law and in view of the cost structures of at


-----

least five entities operating in the relevant sector). Awarding authorities also have the possibility
to provide for a standard calculation method approved by the Council of Ministers for each sector
(to date no such standard calculation methods have been approved).

**_The financial difficulties faced by municipalities that grant us concessions could materially_**
**_adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition._**
Most of our concession arrangements are with municipalities in Spain and Portugal. Under a majority
of our on-street concessions the municipality receives the parking revenues under those concessions
and remits the relevant concession fee to us. As a result, we bear credit risk with respect to these
concessions and such credit risk may be exacerbated by the impact of a future economic downturn in
Spain and Portugal and potential austerity measures imposed by the national governments. In the
event that a municipality experiences financial difficulties, we may not receive payments under the
concessions for months, or even years, and may be obliged to continue providing services under the
concessions, regardless of such outstanding payments, which could materially adversely affect our
business, results of operations or financial condition. For example, during the last economic downturn
in Spain and Portugal, we experienced a significant increase in working capital as a result of delays
in payment by certain municipalities. Additionally, in the event that we become entitled to receive
compensation from a municipality under one of our concessions, such payment could also be
materially delayed.

In addition, the financial difficulties faced by municipalities may result in delays in payments due to
the concessionaire. These delays may ultimately result in litigation against the granting authority.

**_We might be required to complete formal licensing proceedings in Portugal and Spain that_**
**_could result in our need to seek additional approvals from the municipalities and to incur_**
**_additional licensing taxes, costs deriving from the need to update according to new technical_**
**_parameters, fines and complementary sanctions for potential breaching of municipal licensing_**
**_requirements._**
In general, surface rights agreements and administrative concessions in Portugal include clauses
stipulating that upon awarding of the surface right or the administrative concession, the operator shall
seek approval from the Portuguese municipality with respect to the construction project and, in a
significant number of contracts, it is further stipulated that the car park operation must begin upon the
issuance of the applicable municipal use permit (authorizing the use of a certain construction for a
specific use). The understanding and practice of the majority of Portuguese municipalities has been
that, although the construction project is subject to municipal approval, the construction is not subject
to the licensing procedure to which constructions in general are subject, given the fact that it has
been widely understood that these are exempted from licensing in article 7 of Decree-Law no. 555/99
of December, as amended by Law no. 60/2007 and Decree-Law no. 26/2010 which states that the
works promoted by the Public Administration as well as works promoted by concessionaires of public
works are exempt from municipal licensing. Operating without a use permit is punishable by
administrative fines ranging between €1,500 and €450,000. Ancillary penalties may also be applied
and include: (i) the seizure of objects belonging to the responsible entity that have been used in the
noncompliant behavior; (ii) prohibition from exercising the relevant activity within the municipality; and
(iii) prevention from obtaining public funding and subsidies. Empark Portugal does not hold use
permits for six of its car parks; however, Empark Portugal is in the process of obtaining use permits
from the relevant municipalities to operate these car parks.

In Spain, most of the City Councils understand that the construction and operation of a car park is
subject to the corresponding municipal licenses. However, some City Councils consider that the car
parks they sponsor do not require such licenses. No municipal licenses have been issued at ten of
our car parks in Spain, which for the twelve months ended June 30, 2017 represented €9.1 million of
our total revenues.

If municipalities were to require formal licensing to operate such parking facilities, this would require
us to submit additional projects and be charged with additional licensing taxes and costs in order to
obtain such licenses. Note that the corresponding City Council may find that the legalization
procedure subject to the current technical parameters may not be the same required when the car
parks were built. Therefore, additional investments may be required. We may also incur fines or be
subject to sanctions for potential breaching of municipal licensing requirements. In addition, in the


-----

event that such licenses are not granted, we may be unable to operate the relevant concession and
the municipalities may argue that we have breached the relevant surface rights agreements and
terms of administrative concessions, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of
operations or financial condition.

**_Under our concessions, in certain situations, an insolvency proceeding or a change of control_**
**_may result in the termination of the concession._**
Under the terms of our concessions and Spanish and Portuguese law, the municipality may terminate
the concession in the event that insolvency or winding-up proceedings are instituted. If an
enforcement action is brought under the Indenture or the Revolving Credit Facility, for example, we
may be forced into insolvency or winding-up proceedings that could give rise to such termination
(subject to compensation for unamortized investments). See “Regulation—Spain—Early termination
_events and consequences” and “Regulation—Portugal—Termination of the concession”. In any case,_
according to the Spanish Public Sector Contracts (Real Decreto Legislativo 3/2011, de 14 de
_noviembre, por el que se aprueba el texto refundido de la Ley de Contratos del Sector Público)_
(the “TRLCSP”), even where insolvency has been declared, the concession will not automatically be
terminated by the municipality. The municipality may declare the termination upon the declaration of
insolvency and this termination will only be mandatory upon the start of the winding-up phase under
insolvency proceedings (although, in this latter case, transfer of the concession to a party authorized
to carry out such business might be done to avoid early termination).

Additionally, under certain contracts, public authorities impose certain restrictions on the transfers of
ownership of the concessionaire, including a change of control clause, which prohibits the transfer of
the ownership of the concessionaire without the prior approval of the public authority. There is a risk
that one or more municipal councils might consider, in practice, that an indirect transfer also falls
within the scope of this restriction. Should the municipal councils of these contracts apply such
interpretation, it could be argued that such interpretation goes beyond the stated legal provision.
However, in the event of an enforcement action under the terms of the Notes or Note Guarantees
which resulted in the transfer of ownership of Empark, or a change in the shareholding of Empark for
other reasons, the local authorities may attempt to cancel our concessions on such basis. In addition,
the uncertainty concerning the transferability of such concessions itself could reduce the value placed
on the concessions by third parties and ultimately reduce the amount recovered in the event of an
enforcement action.

Direct assignment of the concession is subject to the granting authority’s prior approval, while the
indirect assignment may also be subject to this requirement, depending on the specific contractual
documents and its interpretation by the granting authority. See “Regulation—Spain—Assignment of
_the Concessions and change of control”. The enforcement of the Collateral may also trigger these_
requirements.

The mortgage of a concession requires in general the prior approval by the granting authority. This
authorization will be without prejudice to the second authorization which will be required upon
enforcement of the mortgage. The contractual documents may foresee the need to obtain the
granting authority’s prior approval for the placement of additional security relating to a concession.
For example, placing a pledge over the compensation or other credit rights that the concessionaire is
entitled to receive upon early termination in public works concession awarded post-enforcement of
Law 40/2015, of October 1, 2015, is subject to the granting authority’s prior approval. However, these
restrictions do not apply to the concessions included under the Collateral and thus, no prior
authorization is required for the constitution of the Collateral.

**_We generate a substantial amount of revenues and cash flow from our concessions granted_**
**_by various municipalities. If we are unable to maintain our position as a reputable_**
**_concessionaire, we may be unable to win bids to renew our existing concessions or enter into_**
**_new concessions, and our business, results of operations or financial condition may be_**
**_materially and adversely affected._**
In the year ended December 31, 2016, a substantial amount of our Adjusted EBITDA was generated
under a number of our key concession contracts and any limitations on our operations under these
agreements or reduced demand due to changes in traffic patterns could adversely affect our
business, results of operations or financial condition. Additionally, our risk is compounded as we are


-----

not geographically diversified, with the vast majority of our operations being conducted in Spain and
Portugal. If policies of either of these municipalities change with respect to traffic patterns, or these
municipalities experience financial difficulties that affect the payment of our fees under such
concession agreements, or if the volume of traffic declines in these locations, it could adversely affect
our business, results of operations or financial condition. Additionally, these municipalities may ask us
to enter into amendments to our concessions to lower the fees payable to us or to agree to other
terms which are less commercially favorable than the original agreements. While municipalities may
not unilaterally amend our concessions without indemnifying us for the damages we suffer as a result
of such changes, we may agree to such amendments in order to maintain our relationships with the
municipalities.

We believe the experience of our management, the quality of our reputation in the key markets in
which we operate and the rapport that we maintain with the municipalities differentiate us from our
competitors and are important factors for the generation of new business opportunities that support
our growth. If we are unable to maintain good working relationships with the municipalities and other
third parties, or if we do not meet or exceed their expectations, such parties may be unwilling to
maintain or grow their relationship with us, in which case our business, results of operations or
financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.

**_Changes in the legal framework for concessions may impose significant costs on us._**
The grant and operation of public concessions in Spain and Portugal is highly regulated. The legal
framework applicable to administrative concessions and other agreements under which we operate
parking facilities is subject to changes which could affect the profitability of our concessions and
agreements. We must comply with a variety of laws and regulations relating to our concessions,
some of which impose substantial financial and other penalties for non-compliance, including the
revocation of a concession. In addition, we are exposed to the risk of changes in the regulatory
regime, which changes could potentially impose additional costs on our business, and thus have an
adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition. In the event of significant
regulatory changes, we may request the awarding authority in certain circumstances to modify the
terms of the concession in order to restore the economic and financial balance of the relevant
concession. However, we can give no assurance that such an adjustment would be available, that it
would apply to our surface rights agreements in Portugal or that it would be on terms satisfactory to
us or could be made in a timely manner. If such adjustments are not made or do not provide for
sufficient or timely increases in our revenues in respect of such concession, our business, results of
operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In any event, even if such
rebalancing is successful, it would not generally address all the losses we may have already incurred.
Additionally, court proceedings to obtain an order for economic rebalancing of a concession may take
a number of years to reach a conclusion and could result in costly and time-consuming litigation,
regulatory action or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or
financial condition.

We are currently involved in court proceedings regarding a recent regulatory change in Spain
requiring off-street concessionaires to pay real estate tax, of which they were previously exempt.
Since this was not provided in the concession contracts, we have claimed for the financial rebalance.
However, we can give no assurance that the courts will accept our claims and grant us the requested
relief.

Agreements entered into with private entities, although contractual in nature, are also subject to
mandatory private law legal provisions. Changes in the relevant legislation may also have a negative
impact in our business, results of operation or financial condition.

**_Concessions may be subject to modification or interpretation by the awarding authority and_**
**_decisions adopted in relation to concessions may be challenged by a third party with_**
**_legitimate interest._**
The awarding authority is entitled to interpret the concession contract, resolve any doubt regarding its
execution, modify it for reasons of public interest, terminate it early and also determine the effects of
such termination. The awarding authority may contractually modify a concession contract for public
interest reasons that may affect the terms of the service provision or the price of tariffs paid by users.
Even though the awarding authority’s decisions are deemed immediately enforceable, the


-----

concessionaire may challenge such decision before the courts, requesting their precautionary
suspension. If the modification affects the financial balance of the concession, the administration is
required to restore such balance. As of the date of this offering memorandum, we were involved in
three court proceedings requesting a financial rebalance following a contractual modification
exercised by the awarding authorities. There can be no assurance that our claims will be accepted by
courts or, even if they are, the court proceedings might last several years.

Any decision adopted by the granting authority in relation to a concession may be challenged by a
third party provided this party has a legitimate interest in the result of the annulment of such decision.
The annulment of a certain decision of the granting authority may have a negative impact for the
concessionaire.

**_We have minority partners for certain concessions and are a minority partner with respect to_**
**_certain of our other businesses._**
We operate a number of our concessions through entities in which we do not have a 100% stake. In
some cases, we have a majority ownership interest and have entered into a shareholders’ agreement
with a minority partner in connection with our bid for concessions in a particular region. In the twelve
months ended June 30, 2017, approximately 12.4% of Adjusted EBITDA was generated by entities or
consortiums in which we have a majority stake. For other concessions, we do not have a controlling
interest in the entity holding the concessions. We are exposed to risks associated with the conduct of
our partners in connection with our less than 100% owned business. For example, our partners may
make poor management decisions, or may fail to supply or be unwilling to supply the required
operational, strategic and financial resources to the business. In such cases, we may be required to
dedicate more resources to manage such projects and as a result, management’s attention may be
diverted from existing operations to focus on such businesses. If any of our partners were to
encounter financial difficulties, change their business strategies or were no longer willing to
participate in the businesses, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be
materially adversely affected. Moreover, in a number of the businesses, we do not have the power to
control the payment of dividends or other distributions, so even if the business is performing well, we
may not be able to extract value through the payment of our share of any profits. Our shareholder
arrangements with such business partners may also require us to provide additional investments or
funding from time to time. For example, in respect of our temporary consortium with other partners
(uniones temporales de empresas), we are jointly and severally liable for the obligations of the
consortium vis-a-vis third parties and not only for our share of interest. In such cases, we may be
jointly and severally liable for amounts payable by the consortium and our partners may not
reimburse us for such payments. There may also be circumstances in which we may desire or be
required to acquire the ownership interests of our partners, and we may not have access to the funds
necessary to do so. In addition, our reputation and business, including our ability to retain and enter
into new contracts with public authorities, could be adversely impacted if any of our partners are
alleged to have engaged in illegal or unethical conduct, such as bribery, money laundering and other
corrupt activities or membership in, or aiding, illegal organizations and we may be liable for such
activities if they occur in connection with any joint ventures.

**_Risks relating to our acquisition strategy may adversely impact our results of operations._**
In the past, a significant portion of our growth has been generated by acquisitions, and we expect to
continue to acquire businesses in the future as part of our growth strategy. We have an investment
committee comprising members of our senior management team to review and evaluate and assess
potential acquisitions. When evaluating a potential opportunity, the committee considers targeted
investment returns, the proposed financial models, expected consumer demand for the parking
facility, potential risks and possible economies of scale with existing concession investments.
However, there can be no assurance that any acquisition we make in the future will provide us with
the benefits that we anticipate when entering into the transaction. A slowdown in the pace or size of
our acquisitions could lead to a slower growth rate. The process of integrating an acquired business
may create unforeseen difficulties and expenses. The areas in which we may face risks in connection
with any potential acquisition of a business include, but are not limited to:

-    management time and focus may be diverted from operating our business to acquisition
integration;


-----

-    clients or key employees of an acquired business may not remain, which could negatively
impact our ability to grow that acquired business;

-    integration of the acquired business’s accounting, information technology, human resources,
and other administrative systems may fail to permit effective management and expense
reduction;

-    implementing internal controls, procedures, and policies appropriate for a public company in an
acquired business that lacked some of these controls, procedures, and policies may fail;

-    additional indebtedness incurred as a result of an acquisition may impact our financial position,
results of operations, and cash flows; and

-    anticipated or unknown liabilities may arise relating to the acquired business.

**_Instances of fraud, bribery and corruption involving our management, employees, business_**
**_partners or agents could expose us to penalties and reputational damage and could hinder_**
**_our ability to acquire or renew concessions or even continue our operating activities._**
While we have internal policies in place to mitigate the risks of fraud, bribery or corruption in the
public concession tender processes we engage in, we cannot assure that we can detect or prevent
every instance of fraud, bribery and corruption involving our employees, business partners or agents.
For example, two members of our senior management and certain employees of our business
partners, as well as local government officials, are currently the subject of a preliminary criminal
proceeding initiated in 2016 to investigate an alleged fraudulent grant of an on-street public
concession by the local municipality of Palma de Mallorca in 2013 to a joint venture formed by,
amongst others, our subsidiary Dornier. The initial on-street public concession was awarded for four
years and expired earlier this year, but has since been extended by the local municipality for an
additional year. The individuals under investigation are suspected of bribery, fraud, money laundering,
misappropriation of public funds and related crimes, although the company itself is not currently the
subject of investigation. Upon completion of the preliminary criminal proceedings, a determination will
be made whether or not to proceed with criminal trial proceedings. As of the date of this offering
memorandum, no formal charges have been filed in this matter. We have a compliance program in
place and are not aware of any similar incidents within the organization.

We may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and to reputational damage as a result of such
occurrences. Instances of fraud, bribery and corruption may also be taken into account as a negative
factor by public authorities in considering our bids to acquire or renew concessions and could result
in a prohibition to tender, preventing us from winning or renewing, or making it more difficult for us to
win or renew, concessions in the future. The involvement or association of our senior management,
employees, business partners, construction contractors, suppliers or agents with fraud, bribery or
corruption, or allegations or rumors relating thereto, could negatively impact our reputation and
materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_Our ability to expand our business will be dependent upon the availability and cost of capital._**
The off-street concession segment of the Spanish and Portuguese car park industry is highly
fragmented, and there are opportunities for continued consolidation. We intend to continue to expand
our business through organic growth. Our ability to expand our business will depend in part upon the
availability of adequate capital, which in turn will depend in large part upon cash flow generated by
our business and the availability of debt and equity financing. In the past, weak economic conditions
in Spain and Portugal and the effects of the credit crisis and negative developments with respect to
Euro zone financial markets have had a negative impact on the availability and cost of our bank
financing in Spain and Portugal. If we are unable to obtain the funds needed on acceptable terms, we
will not be able to continue to expand our operations, which could materially adversely affect our
business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_We may fail to successfully carry out construction works under new off-street concessions_**
**_and may not recover our investment._**
When we are awarded a concession for a new parking site, we are exposed to a number of risks
associated with large-scale construction projects, such as the failure of our contractors and


-----

subcontractors to perform, as well as delays and disruptions caused by technical or environmental
problems, adverse weather conditions or other factors. Generally, pursuant to the terms of the
development agreements we enter into in connection with our concessions, our contractors and
subcontractors must indemnify us for any losses or delays resulting from delays in developing the
project and are required to post a performance bond as security for the performance of their
obligations. However, our losses may exceed the amount of the performance bond or the maximum
loss coverage under these agreements, in which case we would not be adequately compensated for
losses derived from construction delays. We may also be required to engage in costly litigation or
arbitration proceedings in order to receive compensation under these agreements. Further, our ability
to obtain compensation under our development contracts is dependent on the solvency of our
contractors and subcontractors. Construction delays will also postpone the time at which the parking
facility will be operational and therefore the time from which we will begin to receive revenues from a
concession. Such delays will shorten the revenue-generating term of the concession and may entitle
the granting authority to impose sanctions or terminate the concession, any of which could materially
adversely affect our business, financial conditions or results of operations.

Once the construction of a parking facility on a new site is completed, we are exposed to a variety of
risks in connection with the opening and operation of the new facility, which could result in us failing
to recover our investment in the new facility. For example, the actual demand for parking spaces at
the new site may not meet our expectations, and we may experience lower than expected volumes
and revenues.

**_We may fail to realize the anticipated benefits from, or may incur unanticipated costs_**
**_associated with, future acquisitions and we may also seek to divest some of our properties_**
**_and other assets, any of which may be unsuccessful or divert our management’s attention._**
We may, from time to time, consider acquisitions of other concession operators. Acquisitions can
involve significant risks, such as the integration of the newly-acquired business, the entry into
unfamiliar markets and the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns.
We may not be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition opportunities in the future or complete
future acquisitions. If we do complete any acquisitions in the future, we may not be able to
successfully integrate the newly-acquired business and we may not realize the anticipated benefits
from the acquisitions, or we may encounter unanticipated costs associated with the acquisitions. If we
fail to identify and enter into attractive markets, to find suitable business partners who can operate
the business effectively, ethically and on reasonable terms, to identify and operate concessions on
acceptable terms, to attract and hire skilled staff, to implement the required infrastructure or to raise
the required funds, our business plans may be jeopardized and the intended consolidation or
increase of our market share may fail to materialize, which could materially adversely affect our
business, financial condition or results of operations.

We may consider and engage in negotiations with respect to disposals of assets from time to time.
Divestitures of some of our assets may yield returns below our investment criteria or even result in
investment losses. In addition, any acquisitions, investments, dispositions or alliances may demand
significant attention from our management that would otherwise be available for our day-to-day
running of the business. Since 2010, we have only registered one car park disposal located on Calle
Sevilla, Madrid, for a total consideration of €22.5 million in 2013.

**_Contractual and other disagreements with awarding entities and counterparties could make us_**
**_liable to them or result in litigation costs or other expenses, which could lower our profits._**
**_Under the terms of some of our concessions, surface rights agreements and other_**
**_agreements, the awarding entity and counterparties may terminate such agreements if we do_**
**_not successfully comply with our obligations. This risk is exacerbated in those subsidiaries_**
**_that are not wholly-owned, as we depend on the decisions of other shareholders._**
From time to time, we are involved in contractual and other disagreements with municipalities and
other public authorities relating to our concession and surface rights agreements and our operations
under such agreements. Such disagreements are more likely to occur during periods of challenging
economic conditions. For the duration of each concession and surface rights agreements, we are
required to maintain the relevant infrastructure asset in satisfactory condition, and upon the expiration
of each concession and surface rights agreements, we must surrender substantially all assets related
to such concession and surface rights agreements to the relevant municipality without financial


-----

compensation. If municipalities claim that we have failed to comply with the terms of our concession
and surface rights agreements, the concession may be revoked or we may not be successful in
extending the agreement at the end of its term. Alternatively, municipalities may not pay us fees in the
full amounts due under the terms of the concession and surface rights agreements. Any such
disputes or delays could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of
operations.

In addition, we operate a number of our agreements with majority partners and may, from time to
time, participate in consortiums over which we do not exercise control over the day to day operations
and decision making process. If a governmental authority decides to terminate or amend our
concession agreements due to a serious violation of our contractual or regulatory obligations, such as
a failure to maintain the facility creating serious danger to users or a persistent failure to make
payments to the awarding authority, we may not be entitled to full compensation for our initial
investment or loss of anticipated profits. In addition, upon a serious breach of the terms of the
concession, the awarding authority could call due any performance bonds granted by us under the
concession agreement, in which case we would be required to immediately repay any such
performance bonds and indemnify the local authority for any damages claimed in excess of such
performance bond amounts. In agreements entered into with private entities, breach of contractual
obligations may also lead to the termination of said agreements. If any of our existing significant
concessions, surface rights agreements or other agreements are unilaterally terminated or amended
by the relevant awarding authorities or counterparties, our revenues in the future may be reduced,
and our business, results of operations or financial condition may be materially adversely affected.

**_We may incur higher than expected costs as a result of unforeseen maintenance problems or_**
**_committed investments._**
Generally, our maintenance costs are relatively low once our concessions have been built and are
operational. However, many of our concessions are more than ten years old and may incur
unforeseen problems such as water damage, cracks in the walls or foundation or sinking. Under the
terms of the concessions, we are responsible for all maintenance and upkeep at our facilities,
including structural repairs. If we were to experience a significant problem requiring repairs, our
maintenance costs may be higher than expected and we may have limited operations at a particular
facility for a period of time.

In addition, the Terms of Tender may include the obligation for the concessionaire to make specific
investments either at the beginning or during the duration of the concession.

Such expenses or reduction in revenue may have a material adverse effect on our business, results
of operations or financial condition.

**_Labor disputes and other labor matters could lead to loss of revenues or higher costs._**
Most of our employees in Spain are represented by labor unions. In particular, due to its labor
intensive nature, our on-street parking business is subject to the risks associated with a unionized
workforce and we have experienced labor disputes that have led to strikes or other disruptions in our
operations in the past. When one or more of our major collective bargaining agreements becomes
subject to renegotiation, we may disagree with the union on important issues that, in turn, could lead
to a strike, work slowdown or other industrial action. There can be no assurance that we will be able
to renew existing labor union contracts on acceptable terms. We can also experience labor disputes
in other situations, such as due to disagreements in work practices. A strike, work slowdown or other
action could in some cases result in the effective closure of our facilities, temporary free parking at
our facilities or disrupt us from providing services, which would result in reduced revenues. The result
of renegotiating an existing collective bargaining agreement could result in a substantial increase in
labor costs that we may be unable to recover through our existing contractual arrangements.
Additionally, we may incur expenses in resolving disputes and complying with local laws relating to
overtime, social security and pension contributions, occupational risk matters and other labor related
issues. We may also incur increased labor costs due to competition, increased minimum wage,
employee benefit costs, medical benefits costs or otherwise which could adversely impact our
business, results of operations or financial condition. Although we have not experienced any material
collective labor disputes in the past, there can be no assurance that labor disputes will not arise in
the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or


-----

financial condition. In addition, our employees may claim that they are subject to a more favorable
collective bargaining agreement, which may result in increased labor costs for us.

**_If we fail to stay current with developments in technology necessary for our business, our_**
**_operations could be harmed and our ability to compete effectively could be diminished._**
Sophisticated information technology and other systems, including systems for the efficient collection
and management of revenue are integral to our business. Our information technology and other
systems must be refined, updated or replaced with more advanced systems on a regular basis.
Developing and maintaining our systems may require significant capital. If we are unable to replace
or introduce information technology and other systems as quickly as our competitors or within
budgeted costs or schedules when these systems become outdated or need replacing, or if we are
unable to achieve the intended benefits of any new information technology or other systems, our
operations could be harmed and our ability to compete effectively could be diminished, which could
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Further, if
we fail to keep up with technological advances in our industry that maintain or improve our
cost-effectiveness or add value to the services we can offer to customers, we may not be eligible to
participate in or win competitive public tenders.

**_Our information technology systems may fail or be interrupted, which could materially_**
**_adversely affect our business. Failure to maintain the integrity of internal or customer data_**
**_could result in faulty business decisions, harm to our reputation and subject us to costs, fines_**
**_and lawsuits._**
We rely on numerous information technology systems that allow us to monitor and manage our
parking concessions and facilities, maintain our financial records, manage our employees and gather
information upon which our management makes decisions regarding our business, including technical
information used in formulating bids for concessions or contracts. The operation of our business is
increasingly dependent on the use of these systems. As a result, system failures or disruptions
resulting from computer viruses, cyber-attacks, cyber terrorism, security breaches or other causes
could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

We also collect and retain large volumes of internal and customer data, including credit card numbers
and other personally identifiable information during the normal course of business. Using our various
information technology systems, we enter, process, summarize and report such data. We also
maintain personally identifiable information about our employees. The integrity and protection of our
customer, employee and company data is critical to our business. Our customers and employees
expect that we will adequately protect their personal information, and the regulations applicable to
security and privacy are increasingly demanding in certain jurisdictions where we operate. Theft, loss,
fraudulent or unlawful use of customer, employee or company data could harm our reputation and
result in remedial and other costs, fines and lawsuits, which may be material.

**_Natural disasters, acts of terrorism and other unexpected events could disrupt our services._**
Natural disasters, such as storms, earthquakes or floods, acts of terrorism and other unexpected
events, such as large-scale electrical power supply outages, fires and vandalism, may result in
reduced revenues for our parking businesses. Natural disasters may also cause economic
dislocations throughout an urban area, region or country. In addition, terrorist attacks have resulted in,
and may continue to result in, heightened security and traffic control measures in urban areas and
increased government regulation of airport facilities. For example, the recent terrorist attacks in
Spain, the United Kingdom, France and Turkey would have a negative impact on consumer travel
and traffic levels in a number of locations where we operate parking facilities. The occurrence and
consequences of such events are unpredictable, and further attacks could result in reduced traffic
levels and decreased volumes for our parking facilities, and thus cause a reduction in revenues, and
our insurance may not be sufficient to cover claims arising from such events. Significant damage or
destruction to one of our facilities may also result in the termination of the concession, and if we were
deemed to be at fault for the damage we may be obligated to rebuild the facility without
compensation. Additionally, such events could cause interruptions in our monitoring or other
information technology systems, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of
operations or financial condition.


-----

**_Adverse litigation judgments or settlements resulting from legal proceedings in which we may_**
**_be involved in the normal course of our business could materially adversely affect our_**
**_business, results of operations or financial condition._**
In the normal course of business, we are involved in various legal proceedings. Such litigation may
result from injuries or property damage to our customers or their property while using our facilities,
from claims arising against us relating to construction at our facilities or breach of applicable laws and
regulations, including laws relating to personal data protection obligations. In addition, we enter into
partnerships with various business partners and are members of trade associations and we may be
jointly and severally liable for judgments or claims made against such partners or trade associations.
We may face litigation by competitors challenging the award of a concession to us, and we may also
litigate against our competitors in connection with the bidding process. In addition, we may face
litigation during the liquidation of a contract. For example, the municipality at one of our car parks has
filed a claim against us in court alleging that we must pay €2.6 million for maintenance works. We
have set aside a provision of €0.5 million to cover the foregoing maintenance works prior to handing
back the concession of San Bernardo as of June 30, 2017. However, in the event we are ordered to
pay more than this amount, our reserves may not be sufficient. It is possible that an unfavorable
outcome of some or all such matters could cause us to incur significant liabilities. Likewise, we may
incur significant legal and other costs in connection with defending our interests in ongoing legal
proceedings. Any significant adverse litigation judgments or settlements could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_We are subject to changes in tax laws, tax rates and their application and interpretation in the_**
**_markets in which we operate, and we have been (and may continue to be) subject to significant_**
**_claims related to tax disputes and audits._**
Our operations that are profit making are subject to profit and income tax and other applicable taxes,
such as property tax. There is no guarantee that tax laws or tax rates may not be changed in the
future. Any change in tax laws or tax rates may increase our tax expenses and liabilities and could
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. We are
subject to various tax proceedings and audits with tax authorities in respect of our operations.

Between June 10, 2015 and July 26, 2017, we were subject to an investigation by the Spanish tax
authority, Agencia Estatal de Administración Tributaria, in respect of corporate income tax for the
years ended December 31, 2010 and 2011, value added tax for the period from January 2011 to
December 2011 and withholding tax for the period from May 2011 to December 2011. In July 26,
2017, we received the final assessment from the Spanish tax authority in which we were requested to
pay €1.3 million in unpaid taxes including late payment interest, of which approximately €0.8 million
related to corporate income tax and €0.5 million related to value added tax, which we paid in
September 2017. On September 27, 2017, we received a penalty assessment from the Spanish tax
authority which amounted to approximately €4.7 million relating to corporate income tax and €0.2
million relating to value added tax (penalties can be reduced by 25% under certain circumstances).
In addition, we cannot rule out that we may become subject to other tax investigations in the future
and that the Spanish tax authority, Agencia Estatal de Administración Tributaria, will follow the same
criteria and approach followed in the foregoing investigation. We are in the course of filing amended
tax returns to regularize the corporate income tax and value added tax payable in respect of fiscal
years 2012 through 2016 reflecting the criteria set out by the Spanish tax authority in respect of the
investigation referred to above in an effort to avoid any penalties. The tax impact of such
regularisation has been estimated to be €33.66 million of additional tax payment, which includes
payment to cover surcharges and late payment interest calculated to September 30, 2017 (including
any surcharges and interest for late payment). The regularisation amount is covered through a seller
indemnity in the Acquisition Agreement and relevant amounts (in the amount of €39.94 million) have
been placed into an escrow account. We also plan to appeal the final assessment paid to the
Spanish tax authority, and therefore, the amounts paid could be reimbursed to us, in full or in part, if
the assessment is overruled. However, if we were to become subject to other investigations, we may
be held liable for additional tax payments, including penalties and interest for late payments, which
may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash
flows in the period or periods for which that assessment is made.

See also note 20 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Group as at and for the
six months ended June 30, 2017, included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.


-----

**_We are subject to foreign exchange risk._**
We use the euro as our functional and reporting currency. While most of our revenues are
denominated in euro, a portion of our revenues are denominated in currencies other than the euro,
including the pound sterling and Turkish lira. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2017, our total
revenues from the United Kingdom and Turkey amounted to approximately 10.3% and 1.4% of total
gross profit, respectively. We are subject to currency translation risk when the accounts of our
businesses denominated in the respective local currencies, are translated into our consolidated
accounts, denominated in euros. We cannot predict movements in such non-euro currencies and
there can be no assurance that our efforts to mitigate the effects of currency exchange rate
fluctuations will be successful or that our risk management procedures will operate successfully.

Although we believe we are relatively well placed to withstand market challenges relating to the exit
of the United Kingdom from the European Union, the economic impact following the vote remains
uncertain and may have a negative impact on our revenue base, and subsequently our operating
profit, in the future. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that our results of operations will not be
affected by fluctuations in exchange rates. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that we could suffer_**
**_and our insurance costs may increase._**
We maintain a portfolio of insurance policies to help protect us against loss or damage incurred from
a wide variety of insurable risks. Each year, we review with our professional insurance advisers
whether the insurance policies and associated coverage that we maintain are sufficient to adequately
protect us from the various types of risk to which we are exposed. That analysis takes into account
various pertinent factors, such as the likelihood that we would incur a material loss from any given
risk, as well as the cost of obtaining insurance coverage against any such risk. In addition, under the
relevant Spanish laws, the operator of a parking facility is liable for any damages to the vehicle and
its contents. The provider of parking services is liable for movable components, accessories or
objects when certain conditions are met, including that such movable components, accessories or
objects are expressly declared by the user, that the provider of parking services expressly accepts
their custody, and that the user complies with security measures. Under Portuguese Law, although
the provider of parking services may be generally held liable for damages to vehicles and their
attachments, the nature of such liability and the legal requirements applicable thereto depend on the
law deemed as applicable as well as the contractual relationship between the parking services
provider and its customers. Notwithstanding our insurance coverage for all or any of these risks, we
may experience one or more material losses for which we do not maintain any or adequate insurance
coverage that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial
condition.

**_Our business is dependent upon key personnel._**
Our success has been, and will continue to be, substantially dependent upon the continued services
of our senior management team. The loss of the services of one or more of the members of our
senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations
or financial condition. We have entered into employment agreements with, and historically have been
successful in retaining the services of, our senior management, there can be no assurance that we
will be able to retain them in the future and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect
on our business, results of operations or financial condition. We do not have any key man life
insurance in place. In addition, our continued growth depends upon our ability to attract and retain
skilled operating managers and employees. On the Completion Date, two members from our
executive management team will resign and enter into transitional services agreements. We are in
the process of seeking new candidates, both internally and externally, to fulfill these positions. For
further information, see “Management—Empark—Transitional Services Agreements”. An inability to
attract and retain qualified members or key personnel in due time could have a material adverse
effect on our business, prospects, operating results and financial position.


-----

**_The interests of our principal shareholder may not correspond with your interests as a holder_**
**_of the Notes._**
After the Completion Date, funds affiliated with the Sponsor, will own 100% of the Company.
See “Principal Shareholder”. As a result, funds affiliated with the Sponsor will have, directly or
indirectly, the power to affect, among other things, our legal and capital structure and our day-to-day
operations, as well as the ability to elect and change our management and to approve other changes
to our operations. In addition, for compliance with certain restrictive covenants, we will depend upon
the cooperation of our principal shareholder who has the power to effect compliance with such
covenants. The interests of our shareholder could conflict with the interests of the holders of the
Notes, particularly if we encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay our debts when due.
Our shareholder may also have interests in pursuing acquisitions, disposals and other transactions
that, in their judgment, could enhance their equity investment, even though these transactions might
involve risks to holders of the Notes. Our shareholder also may disagree over key decisions affecting
our business, and such material disagreements could entitle the shareholder to exercise any exit
rights provided for under the Shareholder Agreement described under “Principal Shareholder” or
could otherwise materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.

The Sponsor and its affiliated funds are in the business of making investments in companies and may
have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, financing or other transactions that, in their
judgment, could enhance their equity investment, even though such transactions might involve risks
to you as holders of the Notes. In addition, the Sponsor and its affiliated funds may from time to time
acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete, directly or indirectly, with us.

**Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness**

**_Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could adversely affect our business and_**
**_prevent us from fulfilling our obligations with respect to the Notes and the Note Guarantees._**
We are, and following the issuance of the Notes in connection with the completion of the Acquisition
we will continue to be, highly leveraged. As of June 30, 2017, after giving pro forma effect to the
Transactions, we would have had total outstanding indebtedness of €547.1 million, including the
Notes. The Indenture will allow us to incur substantial additional indebtedness, including in respect of
committed borrowings of up to €75 million under the Revolving Credit Facility.

The degree to which we will be leveraged following the issuance of the Notes could have important
consequences to holders of the Notes offered hereby, including, but not limited to:

-    making it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes;

-    increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse
economic and industry conditions;

-    requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the
payment of interest on our indebtedness and the repayment of principal, thereby reducing the
availability of such cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, joint ventures or
other general corporate purposes;

-    limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the competitive
environment and the industry in which we operate;

-    restricting us from exploiting business opportunities or making acquisitions or investments;

-    placing us at a competitive disadvantage as compared to our competitors, to the extent that
they are not as highly leveraged; and

-    limiting our ability to borrow additional funds and increasing the cost of any such borrowing.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to
satisfy our debt obligations, including the Notes.


-----

**_We are subject to restrictive debt covenants that may limit our ability to finance our future_**
**_operations and capital needs and to pursue business opportunities and activities._**
The Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contain covenants that impose significant
operating and financial restrictions on us. These agreements limit our ability to, among other things:

-    incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred stock;

-    create or incur certain liens;

-    make certain payments, including dividends or other distributions, with respect to the shares of
the Parent Guarantor;

-    prepay or redeem subordinated debt or equity;

-    make certain investments;

-    create encumbrances or restrictions on the payment of dividends or other distributions, loans or
advances to and on the transfer of assets to the Parent Guarantor or its restricted subsidiaries;

-    sell, lease or transfer certain assets including stock of restricted subsidiaries;

-    consolidate or merge with other entities;

-    impair the security interests for the benefit of the holders of the Notes; and

-    amend certain documents.

All these limitations will be subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. The covenants to
which we are subject could limit our ability to finance our future operations and capital needs and our
ability to pursue business opportunities and activities that may be in our interest.

In addition, we will be subject to the affirmative and negative covenants contained in the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement. In particular, if cash utilizations under the New Revolving Credit Facility
(including cash drawings under ancillary facilities and letters of credit drawn to support cash drawings
under third party facilities) exceed 40% of the New Revolving Credit Facility and any Incremental
Facility on the applicable quarter date, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement requires us to
maintain a specified net leverage. Our ability to meet this financial ratio can be affected by events
beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet them. A breach of any of these
provisions could result in a draw stop or an event of default under the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement. Upon the occurrence of any event of default under the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement, subject to applicable cure periods and other limitations on acceleration or enforcement,
the lenders could cancel the availability of the Revolving Credit Facility and elect to declare all
amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, together with accrued interest, immediately
due and payable. In addition, any default under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement could lead to
an event of default and acceleration under other debt instruments that contain cross-default or crossacceleration provisions, including the Notes. If our creditors, including the creditors under the
Revolving Credit Facility, accelerate the payment of those amounts, we cannot assure you that our
assets would be sufficient to repay in full those amounts, to satisfy all other liabilities which would be
due and payable and to make payments to enable the Issuer to repay the Notes, in full or in part.
In addition, if we are unable to repay those amounts, our creditors could proceed against any
Collateral granted to them to secure repayment of those amounts. See “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—New Revolving Credit Facility”._

**_We will require a significant amount of cash to service our debt and sustain our operations,_**
**_which we may not be able to generate or raise. Our ability to generate sufficient cash depends_**
**_on many factors beyond our control._**
Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt, and to fund working capital and capital
expenditures, will depend on our future operating performance and ability to generate sufficient cash.
This depends, to some extent, on the success of our business strategy and on general economic,
financial, competitive, market, legislative, regulatory and other factors, as well as the other factors
discussed in these “Risk Factors”, many of which are beyond our control.


-----

We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations, that we
will realize revenue growth and operating improvements that we anticipate or that future debt and
equity financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when
due, including the Notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs.

If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources (including borrowings under the
Revolving Credit Facility) are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity
needs, we may be forced to:

-    reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditures;

-    sell assets;

-    obtain additional debt or equity capital; or

-    restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity.

The type, timing and terms of any future financing will depend on our cash needs and the prevailing
conditions in the financial markets. We cannot assure you that we would be able to accomplish any of
these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all. In addition, the terms of our
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Indenture and any future debt may limit our ability to
pursue any of these measures, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations or financial condition.

Any failure to make payments on our indebtedness, including the Notes, on a timely basis would
likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could also harm our ability to incur additional
indebtedness. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to
comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business, results of operations
or financial condition. There can be no assurance that any assets which we could be required to
dispose of could be sold or that, if sold, the timing of such sale and the amount of proceeds realized
from such sale will be on a timely basis or in a sufficient amount.

**_Despite our current level of indebtedness, we may still be able to incur substantially more_**
**_debt in the future, which may make it difficult for us to service our debt, including the Notes,_**
**_and impair our ability to operate our businesses._**
We will be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Although the Indenture and
the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional
indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions,
and under certain circumstances, the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance
with those restrictions could be substantial. In addition, the Indenture and the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness
under those agreements.

**_The loans under our Revolving Credit Facility and the Floating Rate Notes will bear interest at_**
**_floating rates that could rise significantly, increasing our financing costs and reducing our_**
**_cash flow._**
The Floating Rate Notes and any borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility will bear interest at a
variable rate which is based on EURIBOR plus an applicable margin. Fluctuations in EURIBOR or the
occurrence of a market disruption event may increase our overall interest burden and could have a
material adverse effect on our ability to service our debt obligations. We do not currently intend to
enter into any new interest rate swaps with respect to the Revolving Credit Facility and the Floating
Rate Notes. To the extent that EURIBOR were to increase significantly, our interest expense would
correspondingly increase, thereby reducing our cash flow.


-----

**Risks Relating to Our Structure**

**_The Issuer is a special purpose financing vehicle that has no revenue generating operations of_**
**_its own and will depend on cash from the operating companies of the Group to be able to_**
**_make payments on the Notes._**
The Issuer is a newly formed company that was created for the purpose of issuing the Notes.
The Issuer is a special purpose financing vehicle with no business operations and no assets, other
than the Proceeds Loans. The Issuer will therefore be dependent upon the cash flow from the
operating subsidiaries of the Group in the form of interest payments on intercompany loans or other
payments to meet its obligations, including its obligations under the Notes. The obligations of the
Guarantors under intercompany loans will be subordinated in right of payment to certain existing and
future senior indebtedness of such Guarantors, including obligations under the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement. Moreover in case of insolvency of any of the Spanish Guarantors, its obligations
under the intercompany loans will be subordinated by operation of law to any secured or unsecured
claims. If the Guarantors do not distribute cash to the Issuer to make scheduled payments on the
Notes, the Issuer will not have any other source of funds that would allow it to make payments to the
holders of the Notes. The Guarantors may not, however, be able to, or may not be permitted under
applicable law to make upstream payments or advance upstream loans to their shareholders
(including the Issuer) to make payments in respect of our indebtedness, including the Notes, in
particular they are not able to make any payment in respect of acquisition indebtedness. Neither the
Company nor the subsidiaries of the Company will initially guarantee the Notes. The subsidiaries of
the Company that do not guarantee the Notes have no obligation to make payments with respect to
the Notes.

**_Bidco’s ability to meet its obligations under the Proceeds Loans may be affected by a number_**
**_of factors._**
The Issuer’s ability to meet its obligations under the Notes depends on Bidco meeting its obligations
to the Issuer under the Proceeds Loans. In turn, Bidco’s ability to meet its obligations under the
Proceeds Loans depends on its ability to upstream cash from Target and other of the Target’s
subsidiaries. Further to the issuance of the Notes, Bidco will onlend the proceeds of the Debt
Repayment Proceeds Loan to Target and, directly or indirectly, to certain of the Target’s subsidiaries.
Accordingly, any factor affecting the ability of Target and/or relevant subsidiaries to meet their debt
service obligations under those onloans will affect Bidco’s capacity to meet its obligations to the
Issuer under the Proceeds Loans, which in turn would effect the Issuer’s ability to meet its obligations
under the Notes. Furthermore, as a result of financial assistance and other limitations (see
“Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain
_Insolvency Law Considerations”), neither Target nor any of its subsidiaries is able to provide any_
guarantee or security in respect of the Acquisition and Fees Proceeds Loan. To meet its obligations
under that Proceeds Loan, Bidco depends on receiving sufficient dividends (and other distributions)
from Target. The ability of Target to pay dividends (and make other distributions) depends on a
number of factors, including the existence of distributable profits at Target.

**_The Notes will each be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of non-Guarantor_**
**_subsidiaries._**
Some, but not all, members of the Group will guarantee the Notes. The Guarantors generated 72.1%
and 80.1% of the Group’s Adjusted Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA, respectively, for the twelve
months ended June 30, 2017, and held 80.8% of the Group’s total assets (and 76.2% of the Group’s
tangible and intangible assets, excluding goodwill) as of June 30, 2017, in each case excluding our
non-wholly owned subsidiaries and our Non-Recourse Entities. For the twelve months ended and as
of June 30, 2017, our non-wholly owned subsidiaries and our Non-Recourse Entities, collectively, had
€35.7 million of net turnover, €35.1 million of Adjusted Revenue, €12.3 million of Adjusted EBITDA
and €171.5 million of total assets (and €129.2 million of tangible and intangible assets, excluding
goodwill). Our non-Guarantor subsidiaries generated 27.9% and 19.9% of the Group’s Adjusted
Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA, respectively, for the twelve months ended June 30, 2017, and held
23.8% of the Group’s total assets (and 23.8% of the Group’s tangible and intangible assets, excluding
goodwill) as of June 30, 2017, in each case excluding our non-wholly owned subsidiaries and our
Non-Recourse Entities. Certain of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries are not wholly owned.


-----

Unless a company is a Guarantor, such company will not have any obligation to pay amounts due
under the Notes or to make funds available for that purpose. Generally, holders of indebtedness of,
and trade creditors of, non-guarantor subsidiaries, including lenders under our Project Finance
Facilities and bank financing agreements, are entitled to payments of their claims from the assets of
such subsidiaries before these assets are made available for distribution to any Guarantor, as a direct
or indirect shareholder. As of June 30, 2017, after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions, the
non-Guarantor Subsidiaries had €72.1 million of Gross debt outstanding including €59.2 million in
Project Finance Facilities, which would be structurally senior to the Notes.

Accordingly, in the event that any non-Guarantor subsidiary becomes insolvent, is liquidated,
reorganized or dissolved or is otherwise wound up other than as part of a solvent transaction:

-    the creditors of the Issuer (including the holders of the Notes) and the Guarantors will have no
right to proceed against the assets of such subsidiary; and

-    creditors of such non-Guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors, will generally be entitled
to payment in full from the sale or other disposal of the assets of such subsidiary before any
Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder, will be entitled to receive any distributions from
such subsidiary.

As such, the Notes and each Note Guarantee will be structurally subordinated to the creditors
(including trade creditors) and any preferred stockholders of non-Guarantor subsidiaries.

**Risks Relating to the Notes**

**_The enforcement of the Collateral may be restricted by Spanish law._**
The Collateral is, and will be, subject to any and all limitations, exceptions, defects, encumbrances,
liens, loss of legal perfection and other imperfections permitted under the Indenture and the
Revolving Credit Facility and accepted by other creditors that have the benefit of a pari passu
security interest in the relevant Collateral from time to time, whether on or after the date the Notes
are first issued. The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other
imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral, as well as the ability of the Security
Agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral.

The obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees are secured on a first-ranking basis with
security interests over Collateral which also secures our obligations under the Revolving Credit
Facility and certain hedging obligations on a pari passu basis. The Indenture and the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement also permit the Collateral to be pledged to secure additional indebtedness
in accordance with the terms thereof and the Intercreditor Agreement.

No statutory provision of Spanish Law regulates the possibility of creating concurrently more than a
single pledge over the same assets or right (either with the same or with different ranking). In this
respect, we are of the opinion, together with a relevant number of scholars, that the creation of two or
more pledges over a certain asset or right is legally possible and that, similarly, such pledges may
rank pari passu amongst themselves, except for pledges governed by Article 569.15 of the Catalan
Law on In Rem Rights, which expressly prohibits second and subsequent pledges if not granted in
favour of the same secured creditors. Such opinion is based on the Spanish mortgage laws and
regulations (normativa hipotecaria) being analogically applied, even though it should be pointed out
that this opinion is not unanimously supported by the scholars and that there is, to the best of our
knowledge, no case law either for or against the analogical application of the mortgage legal
principles to the ordinary pledge (prenda común). Therefore, although there are grounds to sustain
the effectiveness of concurrent and/or second ranking pledges governed by Spanish law other than
Catalan Law on In Rem Rights, it cannot be disregarded that a court may take a different view and
consider such pledges ineffective and not admissible in Spain.

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the liabilities under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain
hedging obligations will have priority over the Notes with respect to amounts received from the sale of
the Collateral pursuant to an enforcement action taken with respect to the Collateral. As such, in the
event of a foreclosure of the Collateral, holders of the Notes will receive less from the proceeds of
security in an enforcement or insolvency scenario than if they were not required to share the
proceeds. Moreover, holders of the Notes may not be able to recover on the Collateral if the then


-----

outstanding claims under the Revolving Credit Facility and such amount in respect of priority hedging
obligations are greater than the proceeds realized.

Any proceeds from an enforcement sale of the Collateral by any creditor will, after all priority
obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and such amount in respect of such hedging
obligations have been discharged from such recoveries, be applied pro rata in repayment of the
Notes and any other obligations ranking pari passu with the Notes and secured by the Collateral.
The Intercreditor Agreement provides that a common Security Agent, who will also serve as the
security agent for the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility, hedging obligations and any
additional secured debt permitted to be incurred by the Indenture or the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement, will act only as provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement. In general, the facility agent
under the Revolving Credit Facility and any agent with respect to any permitted future secured debt
will have, subject to certain restrictions in connection with, among others, the ability to provide
enforcement instructions to the Security Agent, the right to enforce the shared Collateral.

The enforcement of the Collateral governed by Spanish law is, and will be, subject to practical
problems generally associated with the realization of collateral under Spanish law. For example,
the Security Agent may need to obtain the consent of a third party to enforce a security interest.
The Security Agent may not be able to obtain any such consent or promptly satisfy such
requirements. The consent of any third party may not be given when required to facilitate a
foreclosure on such asset. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon
that asset, and the value of the Collateral may, as a consequence, significantly decrease.

Unless the pledges over shares benefit from the application of Royal Decree Law 5/2005
(“RDL 5/2005”), the beneficiaries have the right to be reimbursed with the proceeds obtained from the
sale in a public auction of the relevant pledged shares and to act themselves as bidders in such
public auction without their having the right to appropriate those pledged shares or to conduct private
sales thereof.

In order for this Collateral to benefit from the application of the RDL 5/2005, it is required that:

(i)    the Collateral assets must be either: (i) cash, (ii) negotiable securities (“valores negociables”)
or other financial instruments as defined in the Market Securities Law, or (iii) certain claims
arising from loans granted by banks. While some scholars have supported that unlisted
securities (such as the pledged shares) fall beyond the scope of RDL 5/2005, as there is no
case-law on this issue, our opinion is that unlisted shares can be the object of a financial
collateral arrangement thereunder and that, accordingly, the Collateral satisfies this
requirement;

(ii)   the relevant collateral assets are in the “possession” or “control” (as such terms are used in the
RDL 5/2005) of the collateral taker.

RDL 5/2005 is silent on the meaning of “possession” and “control”. However, it should be noted
that on November 10, 2016 the Court of Justice of the European Union gave its first ruling on
the scope of the FCD following a referral on questions of EU law from the Supreme Court of
Latvia (Case C-156/15). The judgment, in respect of monies held in an ordinary bank account,
in part addressed the issues of “possession” and “control”. The court indicated that the
collateral taker may be regarded as having acquired ‘possession or control’ of the monies
credited to the account only if the collateral-provider is prevented from disposing of them.
The court further indicated that for the collateral-provider to be prevented from disposing of the
monies a clause would be required which restricted the collateral provider.

Accordingly, it is most likely that Spanish Courts will find that no collateral taker is under the
possession or control of the collateral unless it has the contractual right to prevent the collateral
provider at any time from dealing with, or disposing of, it. and

(iii)   either of the parties thereof is an entity of any of the categories listed in Article 4 of RDL 5/2005
(a “Qualifying Entity”). In this respect, a Qualifying Entity would be (a) public authorities; (b) the
European Central Bank, the Bank of Spain, a central bank of any Member State of the
European Union, a central bank of any third States, the Bank for International Settlements, a
multilateral development bank, the International Monetary Fund and the European Investment
Bank; (c) a credit institution, an investment firm, an insurance undertaking, an undertaking for


-----

collective investment in transferable securities or a management company thereof, a fondo de
_titulización de activos (“non-mortgage securitisation fund”) or a fondo de titulización de_
_hipotecaria (“mortgage securitisation fund”) or a management company thereof, a pension_
fund, or any other financial institutions defined in Article 1(4) of Directive 2006/48/EC of the
European Parliament and of the Council, of June 14, 2006, relating to the taking up and pursuit
of the business of credit institutions; or (d) a governing body of a secondary exchange, a
governing body of a clearing and settlement system, or a central counterparty, a settlement
agent or a clearing house as defined in Law 41/1999, of November 12, on Payment and
Securities Settlement Systems, or a similar institution acting in the futures, options and
derivatives markets, and the members and participants of those markets’ infrastructures where
acting in such capacity.

Each security interest granted over the Collateral will be limited in scope to the lesser of (i) the value
of the relevant assets expressed to be subject to that security interest, and (ii) the maximum amount
secured by the security interest, and enforcement of each Security and Guarantee Document would
be subject to certain generally available defenses. These laws and defenses include those that relate
to corporate benefit, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance,
corporate interest, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of
creditors generally. In particular, as regards financial assistance Spanish Collateral will not secure any
obligations which implies a breach of Spanish financial assistance regulations, and in particular funds
used for the Acquisition. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the
_Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations” and “Security Interests”._

Furthermore, Spanish insolvency law imposes a moratorium on the enforcement of secured creditor’s
rights (in rem security) in the event of insolvency. The moratorium would take effect following the
declaration of insolvency until the earlier of (i) one year from the declaration of the insolvency if the
insolvent company has not been placed in liquidation or (ii) the date the creditors reach an agreement
that does not affect the exercise of the rights granted by the security interest, with the limitations
explained above. This moratorium only affects those assets that are considered as necessary for the
debtor´s activity.

For more information, see “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the
_Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”._

**_Spanish insolvency laws may differ from and be less favourable than the bankruptcy laws or_**
**_insolvency law of other jurisdiction._**
Empark and other Subsidiary Guarantors are organized under the laws of Spain. Accordingly, any
insolvency proceedings against the Spanish Guarantors would likely be based on Spanish insolvency
laws. The insolvency laws of Spain may not be as favorable to holders of the Notes as the laws of the
United States or some other jurisdictions, and certain provisions of Spanish insolvency law could
affect the ranking of the Notes and the Guarantees or claims relating to the Notes and the
Guarantees on an insolvency of the Spanish Guarantors.

The Spanish Insolvency Law foresees a pre-insolvency mechanism whereby the debtor may file the
communication foreseen under Article 5 bis which provides him with a total of four additional months
to reach an agreement with its main creditors and avoid filing for insolvency.

In particular, under Spanish law, a creditor’s rights will be subordinated to the preferential and
ordinary debts of a debtor in an insolvency proceeding if such creditor is determined to be a
‘’specially related’’ party to the debtor. Additionally, under Spanish law payments made under an
equitably subordinated loan preceding the bankruptcy of an obligor may in certain circumstances be
clawed back.

For more information, see “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the
_Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”._


-----

**_Creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging liabilities are entitled to be_**
**_repaid in full with the proceeds of the Collateral sold in any enforcement sale in priority to the_**
**_Notes._**
The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent shall act on instructions provided by
Majority Super Senior Creditors (as defined under “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
_Intercreditor Agreement—Security enforcement”) and the Majority Senior Secured Creditors (as_
defined under “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement—Security
_enforcement”). The Security Agent will act in accordance with enforcement instructions received from_
the Majority Super Senior Creditors and Majority Senior Secured Creditors; provided, however, that
the Security Agent will act in accordance with enforcement instructions received from the Majority
Super Senior Creditors if (a) the obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility have not been fully
discharged within six months of the end of the Consultation Period, (b) enforcement has not
commenced within three months of the end of the Consulation Period or (c) an Insolvency Event
(as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) occurs in respect of any Debtor, Third Party Chargor or
other member of the Group. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor
_Agreement—Security enforcement”. The lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging_
counterparties or lenders of any other future class of debt that ranks pari passu with the indebtedness
under the Revolving Credit Facility may have interests that are different from the interests of holders
of the Notes and they may, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, elect to pursue their
remedies under the Security and Guarantee Documents at a time when it would be disadvantageous
for the holders of the Notes to do so.

**_The Notes will be secured only to up to the lesser of (a) the extent of the value of the_**
**_Collateral that has been granted as security for the Notes and the Note Guarantees and (b) the_**
**_maximum guaranteed or secured amount, and such security may not be sufficient to satisfy_**
**_the obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees._**
If there is an event of default on the Notes, the holders of the Notes will be secured only to the lesser
of (a) extent of the value of the Collateral granted as security for the Notes and (b) the maximum
guaranteed or secured amount as a consequence of legal limitations such as financial assistance or
corporate benefit amongst others. In particular, the security over the Collateral granted by Empark,
Dornier and Infraestructuras will be limited to the value of the Debt Repayment Proceeds Loan (which
is expected to be approximately €424.0 million), and will not secure those obligations or liabilities
which, if secured, will constitute an infringement of Spanish financial assistance laws in accordance
with Articles 143.2 and 150 of the Spanish Companies Act (see “Risk Factors—Risk relating to the
_Notes—Spanish Guarantee and Collateral Limitations”). Not all our assets secure the Notes. In the_
future, the obligations to provide additional guarantees and grant additional security over assets, or a
particular type or class of assets, whether as a result of the acquisition or creation of future assets or
subsidiaries, the designation of a previously unrestricted subsidiary as a restricted subsidiary or
otherwise, is subject to the Indenture, the Agreed Security Principles and the Intercreditor Agreement.
The Agreed Security Principles (as set out in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) set out a
number of limitations on the rights of the holders of the Notes to require granting of, or payment or
enforcement under, a guarantee or security in certain circumstances. Accordingly, the Agreed Security
Principles may affect the value of the guarantees and security to be provided by us and our
subsidiaries. The terms of the security documents securing obligations under the Notes and
applicable guarantee limitations may result in, among other things, the amount recoverable under any
guarantee or security provided by any subsidiary being limited or security not being granted over a
particular type or class of assets. Accordingly, the Agreed Security Principles may affect the value of
the guarantees and security provided by us and our subsidiaries. The validity and enforceability of the
guarantees and security may also be affected by local law limitations. See “Risks Relating to the
_Notes—Certain of the Note Guarantees will be limited to a specified amount, and each Note_
_Guarantee will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws_
_or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability”._

On the Completion Date the Collateral will comprise the following (a) a pledge over all of the issued
shares in the Parent Guarantor; and a pledge over intercompany loan agreements between MEIF
5 Arena Ventures S.à r.l. and the Parent Guarantor; (b) a pledge over bank accounts of the Parent
Guarantor; a pledge over all of the issued shares in Bidco; and a pledge over intercompany loan
agreements between Parent Guarantor and Bidco; (c) a pledge over bank accounts of the Issuer; and
a pledge over intercompany loan agreements made to Bidco (including the Proceeds Loans); and


-----

(d) provided Bidco has been converted into a sociedad anónima by the Completion Date, a pledge
over bank accounts of Bidco; a pledge over all of the issued shares in the Issuer; a pledge over
intercompany loan agreements between Bidco and Empark; and a pledge over Bidco’s rights under
the Acquisition Agreement (and if Bidco has not been converted into a sociedad anónima by the
Completion Date, the security in this paragraph (d) will be provided within five business days of
conversion. Within two Business Days of the Completion Date, the Notes and the Note Guarantees
will be secured on a first-ranking basis by all of the issued and outstanding shares of Empark
_provided Bidco has been converted into a sociedad anónima on or before the Completion Date (and if_
Bidco has not been converted into a sociedad anónima by the Completion Date, the security in this
paragraph will be provided within five business days of conversion. Within 90 days of the Completion
Date, the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be secured on a first-ranking basis by (a) security over
(i) all the issued and outstanding shares of Dornier; (ii) all the issued and outstanding shares of
Infraestructuras; (iii) all the issued and outstanding shares of Emparque; (iv) 24.5% of the issued and
outstanding shares of Sociedad Municipal de Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A.; and (v) 43.0% of the
issued and outstanding shares of Estacionamientos Urbanos de Leon, S.A., (b) an account pledge
covering certain bank accounts of Empark and Dornier; and (c) a pledge over all the credit rights
under certain of Empark and Dornier’s Spanish off-street concessions (which include the rights to
receive compensation, payments and owed amounts under the concession agreements). For further
information see “Description of Notes—Security”. No appraisals of any Collateral have been
prepared, and there is no requirement to provide funds to enhance the value of the Collateral if it is
insufficient. The proceeds of any sale of the Collateral following an event of default with respect to the
Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy, and may be substantially less than, amounts due on the Notes.

The value of the Collateral and the amount to be received upon an enforcement of such Collateral will
depend upon many factors, including whether or not our business is sold as a going concern, the
jurisdiction in which the enforcement action or sale is completed, the ability to sell the Collateral in an
orderly sale, economic conditions where operations are located and the availability of buyers. Further,
there may not be any buyer willing and able to purchase our business as a going concern, or willing
to buy the Collateral in the event of an enforcement action. The Collateral may be illiquid and may
have no readily ascertainable market value.

By its nature, some or all the Collateral may not have a readily ascertainable market value or may not
be saleable or, if saleable, there may be substantial delays in its disposal. To the extent that other
first-priority security interests, pre-existing liens, liens permitted under the Indenture or the Revolving
Credit Facility and other rights encumber the Collateral securing the Notes, those parties may have or
may exercise rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral that could adversely affect the value
of the Collateral and the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on the Collateral. There
may also be other practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests in
the Collateral. For example, under Luxembourg law, the enforcement of share pledges, whether by
means of a sale or an appropriation, is subject to certain specific requirements. The Security Agent
may also need to obtain a power of attorney from the beneficiaries of the Collateral or the consent of
a third party to enforce a security interest. We cannot assure you that the Security Agent will be able
to obtain any such powers of attorney or consent. We also cannot assure you that the consents of
any third parties will be given when required to facilitate a sale of, or foreclosure on, such assets.
Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to sell or foreclose upon those assets, and
the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease.

If the proceeds of any sale of Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes and
the Note Guarantees, holders of the Notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of
the Collateral) would have only an unsecured claim against the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’
remaining assets. Each of these factors or any challenge to the validity of the Collateral or the
intercreditor arrangements governing our creditors’ rights could reduce the proceeds realized upon
enforcement of the Collateral. In addition, there can be no assurance that the Collateral could be sold
in a timely manner, if at all. Proceeds from enforcement sales of the Collateral must be applied in
satisfaction of certain priority obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties under
certain hedging obligations (and any other future indebtedness that ranks pari passu with the
Revolving Credit Facility and such hedging obligations) before being applied to repay on a pari passu
basis the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Notes and any other pari passu
debt. In addition, the Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will allow the incurrence


-----

of certain additional permitted debt in the future that is secured by the Collateral on a priority or
_pari passu basis._

**_Some of the Collateral and the Guarantees will not be in place until Bidco is converted into a_**
**_public limited company (sociedad anónima)._**
The notes will not be guaranteed or secured with Collateral granted by Bidco, which is incorporated
as a private limited company (sociedad limitada) under Spanish law, until it is converted into a
_sociedad anónima and such conversion may not be completed by the Completion Date. Once the_
conversion takes place Bidco will become a party to the Indenture and provide Collateral and
guarantee the Notes. We have commenced the corporate procedure to convert Bidco into a sociedad
_anónima. This procedure is regulated by Spanish law and requires the registration at the Mercantile_
Registry further to the Mercantile Registrar assessment of compliance with legal requirements.
We expect the conversion to take place within approximately two to four months following the date of
issuance of the notes. However, we cannot assure you that such change in corporate form will occur
within a short period of time or that we will be able to effect the change of corporate form at all.
If such change in corporate form did not occur the Notes would not have the benefit of a guarantee
from Bidco or Collateral granted by Bidco.

**_Certain of the Note Guarantees will be limited to a specified amount, and each Note Guarantee_**
**_will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or_**
**_subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability._**
Each Note Guarantee provides the holders of the Notes with a claim through the Trustee against the
relevant Guarantor. However, (a) the Note Guarantees of Empark, Dornier and Infraestructuras will be
limited to the value of the Debt Repayment Proceeds Loan (which is expected to be approximately
€424.0 million) and will not guarantee those obligations or liabilities which, if guaranteed, will
constitute an infringement of Spanish financial assistance laws in accordance with Articles 143.2 and
150 of the Spanish Companies Act (see “Risk Factors—Risk relating to the Notes—Spanish
_Guarantee and Collateral Limitations”) and (b) in order to avoid Portuguese financial assistance_
issues, the Note Guarantees of Emparque and Esli will be limited to a maximum amount of €29.97
million and €25.32 million (respectively) for the Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility, which
represents part of the value of the Debt Repayment Proceeds Loan.

The Indenture will provide that each Note Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that can
be guaranteed by the relevant Guarantor without rendering the relevant Note Guarantee, as it relates
to that Guarantor, voidable or otherwise ineffective or limited under applicable law, and enforcement
of each Note Guarantee would be subject to certain generally available defenses. In particular, as
regards guarantees provided by Spanish Guarantors and Portuguese Guarantors, their guarantees
will not guarantee any obligations which imply a breach of, respectively, Spanish or Portuguese
financial assistance regulations and, in particular, funds used for the Acquisition. Enforcement of any
of the Note Guarantees against any Guarantor will be subject to certain defenses available to
Guarantors in the relevant jurisdiction. Although laws differ among these jurisdictions, these laws and
defenses generally include those that relate to financial assistance, corporate interest or benefit,
fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, insolvency or bankruptcy challenges,
preservation of share capital, thin capitalization, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or
defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. If one or more of these laws and defenses is
applicable, a Guarantor may have no liability or decreased liability under its Note Guarantee
depending on the amounts of its other obligations and applicable law. Limitations on the enforceability
of judgments obtained in New York courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of any
Note Guarantee against any Guarantor.

Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under bankruptcy or insolvency law and
other laws, a court could (i) avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its
Note Guarantee, (ii) direct that the holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Note
Guarantee to the relevant Guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s creditors; (iii) take
other action that is detrimental to you or (iv) subordinate the payment of the Guarantor’s obligations
under its Note Guarantee to other obligations of the Guarantor, typically if the court found that:

-    the relevant Note Guarantee was incurred with actual intent to give preference to one creditor
over another, hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the Guarantor or, in certain


-----

jurisdictions, when the granting of the Note Guarantee has the effect of giving a creditor a
preference or when the recipient was aware that the Guarantor was insolvent when it granted
the relevant Note Guarantee;

-    the Guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value or corporate
benefit for the relevant Note Guarantee and the Guarantor was: (i) insolvent or rendered
insolvent because of the relevant Note Guarantee, (ii) undercapitalized or became
undercapitalized because of the relevant Note Guarantee or (iii) intended to incur, or believed
that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity;

-    the relevant Note Guarantee was held to exceed the corporate objects of the Guarantor or not
to be in the best interests or for the corporate benefit of the Guarantor or be detrimental to the
insolvency estate (under these circumstances any Note Guarantee granted within two years in
Spain or Portugal prior to a declaration of insolvency may be unconditionally extinguished); or

-    the amount paid or payable under the relevant Note Guarantee was in excess of the maximum
amount permitted under applicable law or against financial assistance laws.

These or similar laws may also apply to any future guarantee granted by any of our subsidiaries
pursuant to the Indenture.

We cannot assure you which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor was
“insolvent” at the relevant time or that, regardless of method of valuation, a court would not determine
that a Guarantor was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of
whether or not a Guarantor was insolvent on the date its Note Guarantee was issued, that payments
to holders of the Notes constituted preferences, fraudulent transfers or conveyances on other
grounds.

The liability of each Guarantor under its Note Guarantee will be limited to the amount that will result
in such Note Guarantee not constituting a preference, fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate
distribution or otherwise being set aside. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a
court will apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each Guarantor. There is a
possibility that the entire Note Guarantee may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be
extinguished.

If a court decided that a Note Guarantee was a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance and
voided such Note Guarantee, or held it unenforceable for any other reason, you may cease to have
any claim in respect of the relevant Guarantor and would be a creditor solely of the Issuer and, if
applicable, of any other Guarantor under the relevant Note Guarantee which has not been declared
void. In the event that any Note Guarantee is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, or to the
extent the agreed limitation of the Note Guarantee obligations apply, the Notes would be effectively
subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor, and if we cannot satisfy our obligations
under the Notes or any Note Guarantee is found to be a preference, fraudulent transfer or
conveyance or is otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you that we can ever repay in full any
amounts outstanding under the Notes.

**_Spanish Guarantee and Collateral Limitations._**
Spanish law prohibits financial assistance within the meaning of Article 150 of the Spanish
Companies Act in relation to any Spanish guarantor incorporated or organized as a public limited
liability company (“sociedad anónima”) under the laws of Spain and Article 143.2 of the Spanish
Companies Act in relation to any Spanish guarantor incorporated or organized as a private limited
liability company (“sociedad limitada”) under the laws of Spain. Therefore, any guarantee, security or
indemnity granted by the Spanish Guarantors shall not extend to any payment obligation incurred by
any person for the purpose of, directly or indirectly, acquiring, financing or refinancing the acquisition
of the shares or participations of such Guarantor or the shares of its direct or indirect parent company
or, in the case of a private limited liability company, of any company within its group, as it is the case
of the Acquisition. Guarantees, security or indemnities granted in breach of financial assistance
limitations may be declared null and void, and can result in the imposition of fines to the relevant
directors of the companies committing the infringement. All provisions of the Guarantees and
Collateral shall be construed accordingly to the effect that they will not guarantee or secure those
obligations or liabilities which, if guaranteed or secured, will constitute an infringement of Spanish


-----

financial assistance laws. In addition, the Note Guarantees of Empark, Dornier and Infraestructuras
and the Collateral granted by them will be limited to the value of the Debt Repayment Proceeds Loan
(which is expected to be approximately €424.0 million).

**_Portuguese Guarantee and Collateral Limitations._**
Under Portuguese law, claims may become time-barred (20 years being the ordinary term set forth
under article 309 of the Portuguese Civil Code and may be or become subject to the defense of
set-off or counterclaim.

The terms “enforceable”, “enforceability”, “valid”, “legal”, “binding” and “effective” (or any combination
thereof) mean that all of the obligations assumed by the relevant party under the relevant documents
are of a type enforced by Portuguese courts; the terms do not mean that these obligations will
necessarily be enforced in all circumstances in accordance with their terms. Enforcement before the
courts will, in any event, be subject to:

-    the degree to which the relevant obligations are enforceable under their governing law;

-    the nature of the remedies available in the courts; and

-    the availability of defenses such as (without limitation) set-off, fraud, abuse of rights (abuso de
_direito), violation of public policy principles, duress, misrepresentation, undue influence, conflict_
of interests, force majeure, exception of non adimplenti contractus (i.e. the right afforded to a
party to withhold his/her own performance until the other party has duly performed his/her
obligations under the contract), error, abatement and counterclaim.

As a general rule, under Portuguese law, any guarantee, pledge or mortgage must guarantee or
secure another obligation to which it is ancillary, which must be clearly identified in the relevant
guarantee or security agreement. Therefore, the guarantee or security interest follows the underlying
obligation in such a way that nullity of the underlying obligation entails nullity of the guarantee or
security and termination of the underlying obligation entails termination of the guarantee or security.
In the event that the security providers are able to prove that there are no existing and valid
guaranteed obligations, Portuguese courts may consider that the security providers’ obligations under
the relevant guarantees or security are not enforceable.

Pursuant to Portuguese Law the provision of Guarantees or Collateral in favor of third parties is not
allowed, unless (i) the company has a justified corporate interest in the granting of the Guarantees
and/or of the Collateral or (ii) the company is in a group or control relationship with the beneficiary of
the Guarantees and/or of the Security (although it may be sustained that, for these purposes, both
the company and beneficiary must be domiciled in Portugal).

In addition, the obligations under Guarantees or Collateral granted by the Portuguese Guarantors
shall not extend to any use of the proceeds of the Notes for the purpose of acquiring shares
representing the share capital of such Guarantor or the shares of its direct or indirect parent
company, or refinancing a previous debt incurred for the acquisition of shares representing the share
capital of such Guarantor or shares representing the share capital of its direct or indirect parent
company, i.e. said obligations cannot include granting of Guarantees or Collateral which would
constitute unlawful financial assistance pursuant to article 322 of the Portuguese Companies Code,
approved by Decree Law 262/86 of September 2 (Código das Sociedades Comerciais). In this
respect, all provisions of such Guarantee or Collateral shall be construed accordingly in the sense
that in no case can any Guarantee or Collateral granted by a Portuguese Guarantor secure
repayment of the above-mentioned funds. Therefore, in accordance with the foregoing, the Note
Guarantees of Emparque and Esli will be limited to a maximum amount of, respectively,
€29.97 million and €25.32 million, for the Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility, which represents
part of the value of the Debt Repayment Proceeds Loan. Security over the Collateral securing the
issued and outstanding shares of Emparque will be limited to a maximum amount of €40.0 million
with respect to the Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility, which represents part of the value of the
Debt Repayment Proceeds Loan.

Guarantees or indemnities granted in breach of financial assistance limitations will be considered null
and void, i.e., may have the effect of reducing the amount of the obligations or liabilities assumed
and/or the amount guaranteed or secured to zero, and may result in the imposition of fines to the
relevant directors of the companies committing the infraction.


-----

Moreover, the Portuguese Guarantors will be entitled to claim for themselves immunity from suit,
execution, attachment or other legal process in respect of their obligations under the Note
Guarantees to the extent that their assets are covered by the immunities legally set forth, which
include, but are not limited to, assets that are part of the public domain of the Portuguese Republic
(domínio público do Estado) or allocated to public service purposes.

**_The Security Agent may be required to pay certain Portuguese stamp taxes on behalf of the_**
**_holders of the Notes in order to enforce the Note Guarantees in Portugal._**
The Note Guarantees, as well as certain claims against the Issuer and the Guarantors, will be limited
to a maximum amount of €29.97 million in relation to Emparque and €25.32 million in relation to Esli,
which represents part of the value of the Debt Repayment Proceeds Loan. Under Portuguese law,
certain stamp taxes are required to be paid at the time of enforcement in Portugal with respect to
guarantees granted by a Portuguese company outside Portugal and not presented in Portugal for any
legal purposes until that moment. The Security Agent may be required to pay stamp tax in order to
enforce the Note Guarantees granted by Emparque and Esli at the time of such enforcement. The
payment of such stamp taxes by the Security Agent would reduce the amount recovered in the event
of an enforcement action in Portugal.

**_There are circumstances other than the repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the_**
**_Collateral securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be released automatically, without_**
**_your consent or the consent of the Trustee._**
Under various circumstances, the Collateral securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be
released automatically, including:

-    in connection with any sale or other disposition of the assets provided the sale or other
disposition is in accordance with the “Asset Sale” provisions of the Indenture;

-    if the Parent Guarantor designates any restricted subsidiary to be an unrestricted subsidiary in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture;

-    upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture as
provided under “Description of Notes—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” and
“Description of Notes—Satisfaction and Discharge”;

-    in accordance with the “Amendment, Supplement and Waiver” provisions of the Indenture; or

-    as otherwise set forth under “Description of Notes—Security—Release”.

In addition, under various circumstances, the Note Guarantees will be released automatically,
including:

-    in connection with any sale or other disposition of all or substantially all the assets of a
Subsidiary Guarantor (including by way of merger or consolidation) to a person that is not the
Parent Guarantor or one of its restricted subsidiaries if the sale or other disposition does not
violate the “Asset Sale” provisions of the Indenture, and all obligations of that Subsidiary
Guarantor with respect to other Indebtedness of the Parent Guarantor and its Restricted
Subsidiaries are also released;

-    in connection with any sale of all the capital stock of a Subsidiary Guarantor to a person that is
not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) the Parent Guarantor or one of its
restricted subsidiaries, if the sale or other disposition does not violate the “Asset Sale”
provisions of the Indenture, and all obligations of that Subsidiary Guarantor with respect to
other Indebtedness of the Parent Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries are also released;

-    if the Parent Guarantor designates any restricted subsidiary that is a Guarantor to be an
unrestricted subsidiary in accordance with the applicable provisions of the relevant Indenture;

-    upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture as
provided under “Description of Notes—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance”;

-    in accordance with the “Amendment, Supplement and Waiver” provisions of the Indenture; or


-----

-    as otherwise set forth under “Description of Notes—Guarantors”.

In addition, the Note Guarantees and Collateral will each be subject to release upon an enforcement
sale as contemplated under the Intercreditor Agreement.

See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of
_Notes”._

**_The security interests in the Collateral will be granted to the Trustee or the Security Agent_**
**_(as the case may be) rather than directly to the holders of the Notes. The ability of the_**
**_Security Agent to enforce certain of the Collateral may be restricted by local law._**
The security interests in the Collateral that will secure the obligations under the Notes and the
obligations of the Guarantors under the Note Guarantees will not be granted directly to the holders of
the Notes but will be granted in favor of the Security Agent, except for the Collateral governed by
Portuguese law, which will be granted in favor of the holders of the Notes acting through the Security
Agent, and by Spanish law, which will be granted in favor of the Trustee.

The Indenture will provide (along with the Intercreditor Agreement) that only the Security Agent has
the right to enforce the Security and Guarantee Documents. As a consequence, holders of the Notes
will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of
the Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Trustee, who will (subject to the provisions
of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement) provide instructions to the Security Agent in respect
of the Collateral.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if enforcement of any security interest in Spain and Portugal was to be
carried out by the Security Agent in Spain and Portugal, it may be necessary to prove that the
Security Agent is duly and expressly empowered for such purpose by means of duly notarized
powers of attorney granted in favor of the Security Agent by each of the actual or future creditors, if
necessary, with the Apostille of The Hague Convention dated October 5, 1961. Therefore, there could
be a delay in the execution of the Collateral in Spain and Portugal while the Security Agent obtains
such powers.

In addition, in Spain, it may be the case that for the actual enforcement of the Collateral, each of the
secured parties benefiting from such Collateral would have to evidence its title to the secured
obligations, ratify such Collateral and accept the benefit of the security interest in their respective
names by executing a public deed through duly appointed representatives by means of notarized and
apostilled powers of attorney.

The enforcement of the Collateral governed by Portuguese law shall be made in accordance with the
procedures provided by Portuguese Decree Law no.105/2004 of May 8, as amended from time to
time, and accordingly such Collateral is a first ranking financial pledge (penhor financeiro) entitling the
beneficiaries to appropriate the pledged shares or to conduct private sales thereof.

The granting of security interests in favor of a foreign security agent (acting for and on behalf of
third-party beneficiaries) would be recognized under Luxembourg law (i) to the extent that the
designation of such security agent is valid under the law governing its appointment and (ii) subject to
the type of the security interests granted. Generally, according to article 2(4) of the Luxembourg law
dated August 5, 2005 concerning financial collateral arrangements, as amended (the “Collateral Act
_2005”), a security interest which constitutes financial collateral (in accordance with the provisions of_
the Collateral Act 2005) may be provided in favor of a person acting on behalf of the beneficiary(ies)
of such security interest(s), a fiduciary or a trustee in order to secure the claims of third-party
beneficiaries, whether present or future, provided that these third-party beneficiaries are determined
or may be determined. Without prejudice to their obligations vis-à-vis the third party beneficiaries of
the security, persons acting on behalf of beneficiaries of the security interest(s), the fiduciary or the
trustee benefit from the same rights as those of the direct beneficiaries of the security interest(s)
provided under the Collateral Act 2005.


-----

**_The Issuer and the Guarantors will have control over the Collateral securing the Notes, and the_**
**_sale of particular assets could reduce the pool of assets securing the Notes._**
The Security and Guarantee Documents will allow the Issuer and the Guarantors to remain in
possession of, retain exclusive control over, freely operate, and collect, invest and dispose of any
income from the Collateral securing the Notes. So long as no default or event of default under the
Indenture would result therefrom, the Issuer and the Guarantors may, among other things, without
any release or consent by the Security Agent, conduct ordinary course activities with respect to the
Collateral, such as selling, factoring, abandoning or otherwise disposing of the Collateral and making
ordinary course cash payments, including repayments of indebtedness, provided that they do not
conduct any act or omission that may jeopardize the rights that arise from the Collateral.

**_We may not be able to obtain the funds required to repurchase Notes upon a Change of_**
**_Control._**
The Indenture will contain provisions relating to certain events constituting a “Change of Control” of
the Parent Guarantor. Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, we will be required to offer to
repurchase all outstanding Notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount thereof, plus
accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the date of repurchase. If a Change of
Control were to occur, we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient funds available at such
time, or that we would have sufficient funds to provide to the Issuer to pay the repurchase price of the
outstanding Notes or that the restrictions in our Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Intercreditor
Agreement or our other than existing contractual obligations would allow us to make such required
repurchases. A Change of Control may result in a prepayment event or an event of default under, and
the acceleration of, our Revolving Credit Facility and other indebtedness. The repurchase of the
Notes pursuant to such an offer could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the Change
of Control itself does not. The ability of the Issuer to receive cash from other members of the Group
to allow the Issuer to pay cash to the holders of the Notes following the occurrence of a Change of
Control may be limited by our existing financial resources. In addition, under the terms of our
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, under certain circumstances, we are required to repay a pro rata
amount of debt under our Revolving Credit Facility if we repay all or a portion of the principal under
the Notes. Sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases.
If an event constituting a Change of Control occurs at a time when the Group is prohibited from
providing funds to the Issuer for the purpose of repurchasing the Notes, we may seek the consent of
the lenders under such indebtedness to the purchase of the Notes or may attempt to refinance the
borrowings that contain such prohibition. If such consent to repay such borrowings is not obtained,
the Issuer will remain prohibited from repurchasing any Notes. In addition, we expect that we would
require third-party financing to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a Change of Control. We
cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain such financing. Any failure by the Issuer to offer to
purchase the Notes would constitute a default under the Indenture which would, in turn, constitute a
default under the Revolving Credit Facility. See “Description of Notes—Repurchase at the Option of
_Holders—Change of Control”._

Further, if pursuant to a Change of Control Offer, holders of not less than 90% of the aggregate
principal amount of the then outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes, the
Indenture will permit the Issuer, at its option, to redeem the remaining outstanding Notes at a price of
101% of the principal amount of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. As a consequence,
holders of the Notes may be required to surrender the Notes against their will at a price equivalent to
that paid to tendering holders and may not receive the return expected.

The Change of Control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection
in the event of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring, merger or
other similar transaction involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events
may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute
a “Change of Control” as defined in the Indenture. Additionally, there are certain exceptions to the
definition of “Change of Control” which allow changes in the ownership of Empark if certain conditions
are satisfied. Except as described under “Description of Notes—Repurchase at the Option of
_Holders—Change of Control”, the Indenture will not contain provisions that would require the Issuer_
to offer to repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a reorganization, restructuring, merger,
recapitalization or similar transaction.


-----

The definition of “Change of Control” in the Indenture will include a disposition of all or substantially
all the assets of the Parent Guarantor and its restricted subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any person.
Although there is a limited body of New York case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all”,
there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain
circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would
involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” the Parent Guarantor’s assets and its restricted
subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a change of control has
occurred and whether the Issuer is required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes.

**_The interests of holders of Floating Rate Notes and the interests of the holders of Fixed Rate_**
**_Notes may be inconsistent._**
The Floating Rate Notes and the Fixed Rate Notes will be issued pursuant to a single indenture and
will vote as a single class with respect to amendments, waivers or other modifications of the
Indenture other than with respect to amendments, waivers or other modifications that will only affect
the Fixed Rate Notes or the Floating Rate Notes. The Floating Rate Notes will bear interest at a
floating rate, will have a different call schedule and call protection and will have other features that
will differ from the Fixed Rate Notes. As a result of these differences, the interests of holders of the
Floating Rate Notes and the interests of holders of the Fixed Rate Notes could conflict. In addition,
the holders of one series of Notes may be in a position to agree to certain terms in a consent
solicitation that would be beneficial to such series of Notes but adverse to the economic interest of
the other series of Notes; however, to the extent the relevant amendment or waiver is approved by
the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (subject to the
limited exceptions described above), all holders of the Notes will be bound by such amendment.

**_If Spanish tax authorities determine that income derived from the Notes or the Note_**
**_Guarantees should be treated as Spanish source income, tax at a 19% rate could apply. Such_**
**_tax might be collected by withholding or by payment by holders of the Notes. In certain_**
**_situations, we could be required to gross-up any such payments or reimburse holders for the_**
**_amount of any tax imposed and this could materially affect our financial position._**
Under the Spanish Non-Resident Income Tax Legislation, the Spanish tax authorities may determine
that, under certain circumstances, payments on the Notes or the Note Guarantees should be treated
as Spanish source income subject to tax at a 19% rate.

We have been advised that, under applicable Spanish tax rules, holders of the Notes should not be
subject to such tax, and that all payments of principal and interest made with respect to the Notes or
the Note Guarantees should be made free and clear of any withholding or deduction of any taxes,
duties, assessments or governmental charges of any nature whatsoever which may be imposed,
levied, collected, withheld or assessed by the Kingdom of Spain or any political subdivision or
authority thereof or therein. However, there is no clear precedent to support this position.

If such tax were imposed by withholding any payments on the Notes or the Note Guarantees, the
Indenture requires us, in certain situations, to gross-up any such payments to cover the full amount of
the taxes required to be withheld. If you are obligated to make payments as a result of such tax, we
would be obligated under the Indenture to reimburse you for the full amount of the taxes required to
be paid. The amounts we would be required to gross-up or reimburse could be substantial and could
materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

**_There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the_**
**_Notes may be limited._**
We cannot assure you as to the liquidity of any market in the Notes, your ability to sell your Notes or
the prices at which you would be able to sell your Notes. Future trading prices for the Notes will
depend on many factors, including, among other things, prevailing interest rates, our operating results
and the market for similar securities. Historically, the market for non-investment grade securities has
been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to
the Notes. The liquidity of a trading market for the Notes may be adversely affected by a general
decline in the market for similar securities and is subject to disruptions that may cause volatility in
prices. The trading market for the Notes may attract different investors and this may affect the extent
to which the Notes may trade. It is possible that the market for the Notes will be subject to
disruptions. Any such disruption may have a negative effect on you, as a holder of the Notes,


-----

regardless of our prospects and financial performance. As a result, there is no assurance that there
will be an active trading market for the Notes. If no active trading market develops, you may not be
able to resell your Notes at a fair value, if at all.

Although an application will be made for the Notes to be listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on the Euro MTF market, we cannot assure you that the
Notes will be or will remain listed. Although no assurance is made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a
result of the admission to trading on the Euro MTF market, the failure to be approved for listing or the
delisting (whether or not for an alternative admission to listing on another stock exchange) of the
Notes from the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange may have a material effect on a
holder’s ability to resell the Notes, as applicable, in the secondary market.

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and_**
**_may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**
One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The credit
ratings address our ability to perform our obligations under the terms of the Notes and credit risks in
determining the likelihood that payments will be made when due under the Notes. The ratings may
not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market and other factors that may
affect the value of the Notes, including the additional risk factors discussed above. A credit rating is
not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or
withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No assurance can be given that a credit rating will
remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn
entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant.
A suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the Notes by one or
more of the credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost and terms and conditions of our
financings and could adversely affect the value and trading of the Notes.

**_The transfer of the Notes is restricted, which may adversely affect their liquidity and the price_**
**_at which they may be sold._**
The Notes and the Note Guarantees have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S.
Securities Act or the securities laws of any state or any other jurisdiction and, unless so registered,
may not be offered or sold in the United States, except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a
transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and the applicable
securities laws of any state or any other jurisdiction. We have not agreed to or otherwise undertaken
to register any of the Notes or the Note Guarantees, and do not have any intention to do so. See
“Notice to Investors”. It is the obligation of holders of the Notes to ensure that their offers and sales of
the Notes within the United States and other countries comply with applicable securities laws.

**_You may be unable to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities laws violations._**
We are organized under the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. All our directors and executive
officers and the directors and executive officers of the Guarantors are non-residents of the United
States and all their assets are located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible
for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon us, the Guarantors or our or
their respective directors and executive officers, or to enforce any judgments obtained in U.S. courts
predicated upon civil liability provisions of the U.S. securities laws. In addition, we cannot assure you
that civil liabilities predicated upon the federal securities laws of the United States will be enforceable
in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, Spain or Portugal. See “Enforcement of Civil Liabilities”.

**_The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form, and therefore you must rely on the_**
**_procedures of the relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**
Owners of the book-entry interests will not be considered owners or holders of the Notes unless and
until definitive notes are issued in exchange for book-entry interests. Instead, the common depositary
(or its nominee) for Euroclear and Clearstream will be the sole registered holder of the Notes in
global form.

Payments of principal, interest and other amounts owing on or in respect of the Notes in global form
will be made to The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch, the Paying Agent, which will make
payments to Euroclear and Clearstream. Thereafter, such payments will be credited to Euroclear and


-----

Clearstream participants’ accounts that hold book-entry interests in the Notes in global form and
credited by such participants to indirect participants. After payment to Euroclear and Clearstream,
none of the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Trustee, the Escrow Agent, the Security Agent, the Registrar,
the Transfer Agent or any Paying Agent will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the
records relating to or payments of interest, principal or other amounts to Euroclear and Clearstream,
or to owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly, if you own a book-entry interest in the relevant
Notes, you must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and, if you are not a participant
in Euroclear and/or Clearstream, on the procedures of the participant through which you own your
interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of the Notes under the Indenture.

Owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right to act upon our solicitations for consents
or requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes, including enforcement of security
for the Notes. Instead, if you own a book-entry interest, you must rely on the common depositary
(as registered holder of the Notes) to act on your instructions and will be permitted to act directly only
to the extent you have received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear and Clearstream or, if
applicable, from a participant. We cannot assure you that procedures implemented for the granting of
such proxies will be sufficient to enable you to vote on any requested actions or to take any other
action on a timely basis.

**_Certain payments on notes may be subject to U.S. withholding tax under FATCA._**
Pursuant to certain provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, commonly known as
FATCA, a “foreign financial institution” may be required to withhold on certain payments it makes
(“foreign passthru payments”) to persons that fail to meet certain certification, reporting, or related
requirements. A number of jurisdictions (including the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, Spain and
Portugal) have entered into, or have agreed in substance to, intergovernmental agreements with the
United States to implement FATCA (“IGAs”), which modify the way in which FATCA applies in their
jurisdictions. Under the provisions of IGAs as currently in effect, a foreign financial institution in an
IGA jurisdiction would generally not be required to withhold under FATCA or an IGA from payments
that it makes. Certain aspects of the application of the FATCA provisions and IGAs to instruments
such as the Notes, including whether withholding would ever be required pursuant to FATCA or an
IGA with respect to payments on instruments such as the Notes, are uncertain and may be subject to
change. Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding how these rules may apply to their
investment in the Notes. In the event any withholding would be required pursuant to FATCA or an IGA
with respect to payments on the notes, no person will be required to pay additional amounts as a
result of the withholding.

**Risks Relating to the Escrow Account**

**_The Notes may be subject to a special mandatory redemption, and, as a result, you may not_**
**_obtain the return you expect on the Notes._**
The consummation of the Offering is not contingent upon the consummation of the Acquisition.
However, as described herein, the release of the proceeds from escrow is contingent upon the
completion of the Acquisition. Concurrently with the closing of the Offering, an amount equal to 100%
of the initial issue price of the Notes will be deposited into the Escrow Account for the benefit of the
holders of the Notes. If a Special Mandatory Redemption Event occurs, the Issuer will be required to
redeem all of the outstanding Notes at a price equal to 100% of the initial issue price of the Notes,
plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, from the Issue Date up to, but not
including, the payment date of such mandatory redemption.

The escrow funds will be initially limited to the gross proceeds from the Offering and will not be
sufficient to pay the special mandatory redemption price, which is 100% of the initial issue price of the
Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, from the Issue Date up to, but
not including, the payment date of such mandatory redemption. Certain fees and negative interest
payments may be deducted by the Escrow Agent from the escrow funds deposited in the Escrow
Account. Certain entities controlled by the Sponsor will be required to fund the accrued and unpaid
interest, additional amounts, if any, payable to the holders of the Notes and amounts deducted from
the escrow funds in the event of a special mandatory redemption, pursuant to an equity commitment
letter from the Sponsor to the Issuer. In the event such agreement is not honored, the Issuer will not
have sufficient funds to make these payments.


-----

Upon such redemption, you may not be able to reinvest the proceeds from such redemption in an
investment that yields comparable returns. In addition, if you purchase the Notes at a price greater
than the issue price of the Notes, you may suffer a loss on your investment.

**_Until the Escrow Release, the sole recourse of the holders of the Notes will be to the escrow_**
**_funds deposited in the Escrow Account, and such escrow funds are subject to any risk of loss_**
**_associated with the investment thereof._**
From the Issue Date until the Escrow Release, the Issuer and the Parent Guarantor do not have any
material or tangible assets (except for, in respect of the Issuer, its interest in the Escrow Account) and
holders of the Notes will not have any recourse to Empark or any of its subsidiaries. Until after the
Completion Date, the Notes will not be guaranteed other than by the Parent Guarantor (and Bidco
provided it is converted to a sociedad anónima before the Completion Date), which do not have any
material or tangible assets, and the Issuer will have very limited assets (except for its interest in the
Escrow Account). As a result, the sole recourse of the holders of the Notes prior to the Escrow
Release will be to the funds deposited in the Escrow Account and the guarantees of the Parent
Guarantor (and Bidco provided it is converted to a sociedad anónima before the Completion Date).
The holders of the Notes prior to the Escrow Release will be subject to any risk of loss associated
with the funds deposited in the Escrow Account, as such Escrow Account may bear negative interest.

**_The Escrow Release is conditioned on, among other things, the completion of the Acquisition;_**
**_and, prior to the Escrow Release, Bidco may modify or waive the terms or conditions of the_**
**_Acquisition or other related transaction documents without the consent of the holders of the_**
**_Notes._**
Your decision to invest in the Notes is made at the time you purchase the Notes. The Escrow
Agreement will provide as one of the conditions to the Escrow Release that the Issuer certify that the
transactions that will result in the completion of the Acquisition will be completed promptly following
the Escrow Release. However, the Escrow Release is not conditioned on the consummation of the
Acquisition on terms and subject to conditions that are the same (or substantially the same) as those
that applied as of the time you purchase the Notes. Prior to the consummation of the Acquisition,
Bidco may amend or waive the terms or conditions of the Acquisition or other related transaction
documents. The holders of Notes are afforded only limited consent or approval or other rights with
respect to any such modifications or waivers, even though such modifications or waivers might have
an adverse impact on our business or financial condition after the Acquisition.

**_Bidco does not currently control the Target and will not control the Target until completion of_**
**_the Acquisition._**
The Target is ultimately controlled by the Sellers as well as members of management. Bidco will not
obtain control of the Target until the completion of the Acquisition. The Sellers may not operate the
business of the Target during the interim period in the same way that we would. The information
contained in this offering memorandum has been derived from industry publications and from surveys
or studies conducted by third-party sources and, in the case of historical information relating to the
Target, has been provided to us by the Sellers as well as members of management of the Target, and
we have relied on such information supplied to us in its preparation.

Furthermore, the Transactions themselves have required, and will likely continue to require,
substantial time and focus from management, which could adversely affect their ability to operate the
business. Likewise, other employees may be uncomfortable with the Transactions or feel otherwise
affected by it, which could have an impact on work quality and retention. The integration process
could distract our management or disrupt our ongoing business, which could in turn adversely affect
our ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or to achieve the anticipated
benefits of the acquisition, or could otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations or
financial condition.

In addition, prior to the Completion Date, the Target will not be subject to the covenants described in
“Description of Notes” to be included in the Indenture. As such, we cannot assure you that, prior to
such date, the Target will not take an action that would otherwise have been prohibited by the
Indenture had such covenants been applicable.

# The Transactions

**The Acquisition**
On July 28, 2017, Bidco, an entity formed by the Sponsor for purposes of facilitating the Acquisition,
entered into a sale and purchase agreement (the “Acquisition Agreement”) with the Sellers to acquire
all the issued and outstanding share capital of the Target from the Sellers. Completion of the
Acquisition is expected to occur in December 2017. If the actions to be undertaken at the scheduled
date of consummation of the transaction are not conducted (and not remedied within the relevant
time periods provided therefore), the Acquisition Agreement may be terminated by the non-breaching
party.

The Issuer, a private limited liability company (“société à responabilité limitée”), incorporated and
existing under the laws of Luxembourg is a wholly owned subsidiary of Bidco, a limited liability
company incorporated and existing under the laws of Spain. Bidco, in turn, is a wholly owned
subsidiary of the Parent Guarantor, a private limited liability company (“société à responabilité
_limitée”) incorporated and existing under the laws of Luxembourg. The Parent Guarantor, in turn, is a_
wholly owned subsidiary of MEIF 5 Arena Ventures S.à r.l, a private limited liability company (“société
_à responabilité limitée”) incorporated and existing under the laws of Luxembourg which in turn is_
indirectly wholly-owned by MEIF 5. Each of MEIF 5 Arena Ventures S.à r.l, the Parent Guarantor,
Bidco and the Issuer were formed or acquired to facilitate the Transactions.

The Transactions will involve the Acquisition on the Completion Date of 100% of the issued share
capital of the Target by Bidco.

On each of the Issue Date and the Completion Date, the Issuer will be indirectly wholly-owned by the
Sponsor. See “Principal Shareholder”.

**The Financing and Completion Date Transactions**
The cash consideration for the Acquisition, together with the Debt Repayment and estimated
transaction fees and expenses, is expected to be in aggregate €942.5 million. The Acquisition, the
Debt Repayment and estimated transaction fees and expenses will be financed as follows
(collectively, the “Financing”):

-    €467.5 million indirect cash contribution by the Sponsor (the “Equity Contribution”); and

-    The Issuer will issue the Notes offered hereby in the aggregate principal amount of €475.0
million. See “Use of Proceeds”.

In connection with the Acquisition, on or before the Completion Date, Bidco will enter into the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, which will provide for up to €75 million in revolving credit to be
made available to Bidco. Bidco is not permitted to draw down funds under the Revolving Credit
Facility before the Completion Date. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—New
_Revolving Credit Facility”._

On the Completion Date, the Issuer will use the net proceeds from the offering of Fixed Rate Notes
issued on the Issue Date to make the Fixed Rate Notes Proceeds Advances pursuant to the
Proceeds Loans, the total principal amount of which shall be equal to the aggregate principal amount
of the Fixed Rate Notes issued on the Issue Date.

On the Completion Date, the Issuer will use the net proceeds from the offering of Floating Rate Notes
issued on the Issue Date to make the Floating Rate Notes Proceeds Advances pursuant to the
Proceeds Loans, the total principal amount of which shall be equal to the aggregate principal amount
of the Floating Rate Notes issued on the Issue Date. The Proceeds Loans will provide that the
borrower under each of the Proceeds Loans thereunder will pay to the lender thereunder interest and
principal as it becomes payable on the corresponding series of Notes (including any additional
amounts due thereunder).

The proceeds of the Debt Repayment Proceeds Loan will be used to repay existing debt outstanding
at the Target Group in an aggregate amount of €424.0 million, including (i) the redemption in full of
the Existing Notes, and (ii) the repayment of amounts outstanding under certain of our Project


-----

Finance Facilities as well as certain loans and leases. The proceeds of the Acquisition and Fees
Proceeds Loan will be used to partially fund the acquisition consideration due to the Sellers (in an
expected total acquisition consideration amount of €486.0 million) and to pay €32.5 million of fees
and expenses related to the Transactions.

**Release of proceeds from escrow**
Pending the completion of the Acquisition, the gross proceeds of the Offering will be deposited into
the Escrow Account in the name of the Issuer but controlled by, and pledged on a first-ranking basis
in favor of the Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes, pursuant to the Escrow Agreement. The
release of the escrow proceeds will be subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. See
“Description of Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption”. If the Acquisition is not
completed on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date, or upon the occurrence of certain other events,
then all of the Notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption. The special mandatory
redemption price will be equal to 100% of the initial issue price of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid
interest and additional amounts, if any, from the Issue Date up to, but not including, the payment date
of such special mandatory redemption. See “Description of Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special
_Mandatory Redemption”. In the event that escrowed proceeds are insufficient to pay the special_
mandatory redemption price, the Sponsor will be required to provide funds to the Issuer in an amount
required to enable the Issuer to pay such accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any,
owing to the holders of the Notes, pursuant to an equity commitment letter from the Sponsor to the
Issuer.

For more information on the Transactions, see “Use of Proceeds”, “Capitalization”, “Description of
_Certain Financing Arrangements” and “Description of Notes”._

# Use of Proceeds

We estimate that the gross proceeds from the Offering will be €475.0 million. The gross proceeds will
be deposited into the Escrow Account in the name of the Issuer but will be controlled by, and pledged
on a first-ranking basis in favor of, the Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes, pursuant to the
Escrow Agreement. The release of the escrow proceeds will be subject to the satisfaction of certain
conditions. The gross proceeds from the Offering will be used to (i) complete the Debt Repayment, (ii)
finance, along with the Equity Contribution, the purchase price of the Acquisition, and (iii) pay the fees
and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions, including fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the Offering.

The expected estimated sources and uses of the funds necessary to consummate the Transactions,
including the proceeds of the Offering after the Escrow Release are shown in the table below as if
they had occurred as at June 30, 2017. Actual amounts will vary from estimated amounts depending
on several factors, including differences from our estimate of existing cash in the business, our
estimates of the cost of repaying the existing indebtedness described below, differences from our
estimates of costs and expenses and the ultimate timing of the Completion Date.

(1)  Represents the aggregate principal amount of the Notes offered hereby. In the event that the Completion Date does not take
place on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date, or if certain other events occur or fail to occur, all of the Notes will be subject
to a special mandatory redemption. The special mandatory redemption price will be equal to 100% of the initial issue price
of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, from the Issue Date to but not including, the
payment date of such special mandatory redemption. See “Description of Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory
_Redemption”._

as of June 30, 2017, and (iii) a redemption premium on the Existing Notes assuming a redemption date as of December 15,
2017. Actual amounts required to finance the Debt Repayment will vary due to factors such as different amounts of accrued
interest and possible break costs with respect to the existing debt depending on the ultimate timing of the Completion Date.

(5) The amount shown represents estimated fees and expenses associated with the Transactions, including transaction costs
(due diligence), debt up–front fees and stamp duty fees.

_discussion of the risks and uncertainties which we face, see “Forward-Looking Statements” and_
“Risk Factors”.

**Overview**
We are one of the leading concessionaires and operators of parking infrastructure in the Iberian
Peninsula, as measured by number of parking spaces and revenues. We mainly operate
underground car parks (“off-street”), as well as some parking areas on city streets (“on-street”) under
concessions and surface rights agreements from public authorities. As of June 30, 2017, our portfolio
comprised 432 contracts in 189 municipalities and other contracts with customers such as AENA and
ANA, the respective Spanish and Portuguese public airport operators, under which we manage over
522,000 parking spaces in Spain, Portugal, the United Kingdom, Andorra, France and Turkey. For the
twelve months ended June 30, 2017, our net turnover was €206.0 million, our Adjusted Revenue was
€205.7 million and our Adjusted EBITDA was €73.2 million. Our operations in Spain and Portugal,
respectively, represented 67.6% and 20.6% of our net turnover, 67.6% and 20.6% of our Adjusted
Revenue, 68.8% and 28.8% of our gross profits, 68.4% and 29.8% of our Adjusted EBITDA and
75.9% and 11.8% of our parking spaces for the twelve months ended June 30, 2017.

We have served the Iberian market since the late 1960s. We believe this has given us a “first mover”
advantage, whereby we have continually secured long-term concessions and built a portfolio of prime
parking locations in Spain and Portugal, including in city centers, airports and other high density
traffic areas, such as hospitals and business districts. Due to a variety of physical, regulatory and
other constraints such as cost of space, we believe that there is limited opportunity to develop
alternative parking options in many of these prime areas, allowing us to benefit from captive demand
with limited competition.

**Factors affecting results of operations**

**_Business lines_**
Our Adjusted EBITDA Margins vary between our off-street concession, on-street concession and
off-street contract management business lines.

_Off-street: In general, our long-term off-street concessions have the highest Adjusted EBITDA_
Margins among our different types of concessions, but also involve the largest up-front investments.
There is significant variation in Adjusted EBITDA Margins among our off-street concessions, with
some concessions generating significantly greater Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margins
than others. Our on-street concession and off-street contract management businesses tend to have
lower Adjusted EBITDA Margins than our off-street concession business, but also require minimal
investment and face lower demand risk because a smaller proportion of our revenue depends on
volumes or occupancy. For our off-street concessions, as well as many of our on-street concessions


-----

and other contracts, our revenue comes primarily from the payments we receive from customers to
use the parking spaces on a “pay as you go” (hourly) or subscription (monthly or yearly) basis.
We also generate revenue from the sale of parking spaces, primarily to local residents.

_On-street: In our on-street concessions, we generate revenue under a number of different pricing_
models. The most common model is for us to receive a fixed fee which we withhold from the funds
collected from the metered parking spaces and transfer the remaining funds to the grantor. In a
number of concessions, the contract also includes a variable incentive element (which may be based
on a percentage of the collected meter receipts, the number of parking spaces or certain other
qualitative criteria) to align the concessionaire’s objectives with optimizing revenue collection. Under
some of our on-street concessions, we receive the entire amount of tariffs collected from users.

_Off-street contract management: For our contracts in the off-street contract management business,_
our revenue primarily consists of the fixed fees we receive from the owner of the facility for managing
the parking facilities.

**_Concession cycle_**
Our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA are affected by how much time has passed since our new
off-street concessions became operational. The revenue and Adjusted EBITDA of new car parks
gradually increase in the first three to four years (the “ramp up” phase) after they become operational,
and then remain fairly stable with, in most cases, moderate increases due to inflation adjustments
and volume increases (largely reflecting increased demand due to traffic increases in cities) for the
remaining duration of the concession. Parking spaces sold to local residents are recorded as net
turnover at the time of sale and as a result, off-street concessions can generate significant net
turnover and Adjusted EBITDA in the first year they become operational. Therefore, 0.3%, 0.3% and
0.4% of our net turnover was attributable to the sale of parking spaces to local residents, as required
by the terms of the relevant concession in the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016,
respectively. See “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Cash flows from investment activities” below.
However, we do not expect that sales of parking spaces will remain a significant factor affecting our
results of operations in future periods.

**_Demand risk_**
The revenues from our off-street concessions are influenced by demand and volumes, which
primarily depend on the location of the particular concession. On-street concessions and off-street
contract management arrangements have less demand risk because the bulk of the revenues from
such arrangements are based on a fixed fee. Our concessions are also affected by changes in the
traffic flow in cities, which in turn directly impacts demand. Traffic flow in urban areas can be affected
by a number of factors, including changes in economic activity in an area, local traffic regulations and
gasoline prices. Parking can also be affected by general economic conditions, but we believe to a
lesser degree than in other infrastructure businesses because end users view many trips during
which they use our parking facilities as non-discretionary. In addition, we have implemented various
measures to increase our revenues and improve EBITDA as further described under “Summary—
_Strategy—Maintain focus on growing revenue and improving EBITDA”._

**_Obtaining new concessions and contracts_**
Off-street concessions, which represented 85.8% of our Adjusted EBITDA in the twelve months
ended June 30, 2017, offer stable cash flows given the long-term nature of these contracts
(which can be up to 50 years if they include the obligation to carry out construction works).
The Weighted Average Remaining Duration of our off-street concessions and contracts was
approximately 25 years as of June 30, 2017. Cash flows with respect to our on-street concession
business are potentially less stable because such concessions come up for renewal more frequently
(approximately every seven years). Increasing our revenues is dependent in part on obtaining new
concessions and winning concessions from our competitors when they are up for renewal, while
maintaining our existing concessions. Since the beginning of 2014, we have achieved a Renewal
Rate of approximately 71% with respect to on-street contracts and concessions for which we
submitted bids when they came up for tender. Furthermore, in both Spain and Portugal, we have won
approximately 29% of the tenders for new on-street contracts and concessions, and approximately
24% of the expiring on-street contracts and concessions that were previously operated by our
competitors, in each case for which we submitted bids since the beginning of 2014 until June 2017.


-----

Recently, municipalities have increased the duration for certain on-street concessions put up to
tender in exchange for higher initial fee payments payable by the concessionaire. For example, we
have an on-street concession with a term of 20 years in Huelva, one with a term of 15 years in
Huesca and another one with a term of 12 years in Porto, which commenced in 2016. We believe this
trend of increasing the duration of on-street concessions in exchange for higher upfront payments by
the concessionaire benefits us given our size, scale and well established position within the market.
In addition, from time to time we may make acquisitions which meet our stringent financial
requirements, which will in turn expand our portfolio of concessions.

**_Cost control initiatives and EBITDA improvements_**
We seek to increase our revenue through obtaining new concessions and winning concessions from
our competitors when they are up for renewal. We also seek to increase our revenue in our off-street
concession business by increasing volumes and occupancy through a well defined pricing policy,
including with respect to our season ticket offering, tariff structure and special offers and promotions.
In our on-street concession business, we seek to grow our revenue by improving our on-street
revenue collection through the implementation of best practices, so as to improve our variable
incentive compensation payments under the relevant concession. Additionally, we anticipate that
revenues from our large parking facilities opened in the past three years will increase over the
coming years as they are currently in the “ramp up” phase. Since a substantial portion of our revenue
is largely stable and predictable as a result of being generated under existing long-term concessions
and contracts, one of the drivers of EBITDA is our ability to control costs. The nature of our costs
varies between our business lines. In our off-street concession business, we are generally required to
make a significant capital expenditure upfront in connection with our investment in a new parking
facility or an upfront payment to the municipality for an existing facility. Once that initial expense has
been incurred, our off-street costs are largely stable and primarily relate to personnel costs,
maintenance costs (mainly cleaning and painting) and utilities. In our on-street concession business,
our upfront costs are considerably lower and may consist of a lump-sum payment to the municipality
or relate to the acquisition and installation of on-street parking control equipment, such as parking
meters. After that initial investment has been made, most of our on-street costs consist of personnel
costs. In our off-street contract management business, our costs consist primarily of personnel costs
and the fixed fees that we pay to the owner of the parking facility, with maintenance accounting for
only a small portion of costs. We have implemented a number of measures by which we have
successfully reduced costs, including the introduction of technological innovations to help increase
productivity and the number of parking spaces covered per employee. We have introduced a
centralized system to control and manage a substantial majority of our off-street parking facilities from
a remote location, which has allowed us to reduce personnel costs by reducing headcount while
maintaining our high quality of services and customer satisfaction levels. Such efficiencies have led to
significant savings in operating expenses as we reduced the number of operators per car park by
more than half. In addition, such measures have helped us to reduce our reliance on external service
providers by enabling us to reallocate personnel to perform certain functions previously performed by
third party service providers. Furthermore, we have introduced energy saving measures to drive
energy efficiency improvements, such as implementing automatic devices to regulate lighting in our
car parks, as well as carrying out active monitoring and management of energy prices through
negotiation with utility providers. We continue to seek opportunities to further reduce costs and
improve EBITDA.

**Key Line Items**

**_Net turnover_**
Net turnover consists primarily of the parking fees and other revenue we receive from customers for
use of parking spaces and fees from municipalities and other entities for managing parking spaces
and facilities. The fees we charge users and the fees we receive for managing parking spaces and
facilities are typically indexed to inflation. Net turnover also includes revenue from the sale of parking
spaces to local residents as an ancillary activity in connection with the development of some parking
facilities. For the sale of parking spaces, we recognize revenues at the time the parking space is sold,
which coincides with the time at which the relevant contract is signed. In our on-street concession
business, in which we may be paid a fixed fee by the municipality, we recognize revenue with respect
to such fixed fees when the service is provided to the municipality. Revenue is recognized when the


-----

value can reliably be determined and all contingencies have been resolved, and it is probable that we
will receive the future economic benefits. In our off-street concession business, revenues are
recorded either when the hourly rate is paid or on an accrual basis for season ticket holders. For
those concessions in respect of which we are paid a fee linked to the amount of collected meter
receipts, we recognize revenue with respect to such fee at the time of such collection.

**_Other operating income_**
Other operating income consists of revenue from certain basic amenities provided to car park users
within our parking facilities (for example, revenue from vending machines and car washes) and other
services and products provided or sold to car park users, as well as other non-recurrent revenue
which is “one off” in nature.

**_Adjusted Revenue_**
We define Adjusted Revenue as net turnover plus other operating income less other non-recurrent
revenue less other “one off” or non-recurring gains and losses (including gains and losses realized
from the sale of parking spaces to local residents and gains and losses realized on the sale of
parking facilities). Adjusted Revenue is a non-IFRS measure that we use to evaluate our operating
and financial performance and should not be considered as an alternative measure to accounting
measures under IFRS. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information”.

**_Variation in stock of finished products and products in process_**
Variation in stock of finished products and products in process represents the costs of the parking
spaces that are sold. We determine these costs by allocating the construction costs associated with
such spaces. Such expense is recognized at the time the corresponding revenue for the sale is
recognized. See “—Amortization of fixed assets” below.

**_Supplies_**
Supplies consist of the cost of goods and materials bought that are necessary to provide customers
with the relevant services, including tickets for our automated ticket machines and other materials.

**_Staff costs_**
Staff costs include employee wages, salaries and other expenses, as well as redundancy payments,
social security, pensions and similar costs. The majority of our staff costs are incurred with respect to
our on-street concession business and, to a lesser extent, our off-street contract management
business.

**_Other operating expenses_**
Other operating expenses primarily consist of costs for external services including information
technology and other outsourced services such as security and shuttle buses at airports. This
expense category also includes overhead costs, local taxes, concession fees and non-recurring
operating expenses.

**_Amortization of fixed assets_**
Under IFRIC 12, we record the capital cost of developing and constructing parking structures and
installing parking meters under concession contracts as intangible assets on our balance sheet.
Amortization expenses primarily include the amortization of these capital costs over the term of the
concession agreement on a straight line basis. It also includes amortization on equipment and other
tangible assets accounted for using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the
asset. To the extent an agreement is terminated early, we write off any remaining cost of capital on
our balance sheet.


-----

**_Provisions and loss through unrecoverable credits_**
Provisions and loss through unrecoverable credits consists of expenses that we reserve for in the
relevant estimated amount to take account of the potential insolvency of our customers. In general,
we do not make provision for municipalities or other public bodies with which we do business. For
private bodies, we make provision within 90 to 180 days after the due date for collection and do so on
a case by case basis with the relevant contract manager.

**_Impairment and result through disposal of fixed assets_**
Impairment and result through disposal of fixed assets primarily consists of gains or losses on the
sale of concessions or parking facilities. It also includes any asset impairment charges made at the
end of each year to reduce the holding value of assets to recoverable value, if lower. The recoverable
value is the lower of the market value and the value in use of the asset.

**_Financial result_**
Financial result comprises financial profit or loss primarily attributable to interest expense on our debt
and any interest income we receive, usually from cash held at banks. It also includes hedging profits
or loss from our hedging instruments. During the period under review, our hedging comprised interest
rate swaps on our variable rate debt.

**_Share in results of equity-consolidated companies_**
Share in results of equity-consolidated companies consists of our proportionate share of the income
from companies in which we hold minority interests. We generally hold minority interests in
companies when necessary to obtain concessions where the municipalities have required that the
controlling interest be held by the municipality.

**_Corporation tax_**
We recognize corporation tax on our income statement both for amounts payable in the current year
and any applicable deferred tax attributable to the current year. In past years, we have accumulated
significant tax credits from our large capital expenditure program, which we expect to reduce our
taxes payable on a cash basis in future years.

**_Results attributed to minority interests_**
Results attributed to minority interests consist of the proportionate share of the income attributable to
third parties holding a minority interest in the relevant Group company.

**_EBITDA_**
We define EBITDA as consolidated operating results excluding amortization of fixed assets and
provisions and losses through unrecoverable receivables. EBITDA is a non-IFRS measure that we
use to evaluate our operating and financial performance and should not be considered as an
alternative measure to accounting measures under IFRS. See “Presentation of Financial and Other
_Information”._

**_Adjusted EBITDA for the Group_**
We define Adjusted EBITDA for the Group as EBITDA adjusted for (i) non-recurring headquarter
operating expenses (including redundancy payments and other related personnel costs),
(ii) non-recurring business unit expenses and (iii) other “one off” or non-recurring gains and losses
(including gains and losses realized from the sale and acquisition of parking spaces to local residents
and gains and losses realized on the sale of parking facilities). Adjusted EBITDA is a non-IFRS
measure that we use to evaluate our operating and financial performance and should not be
considered as an alternative measure to accounting measures under IFRS. See “Presentation of
_Financial and Other Information”._


-----

**_Adjusted EBITDA by business line_**
We define Adjusted EBITDA by business line as the EBITDA for the relevant business line adjusted
_for (i) reallocation of overhead costs and non-recurring headquarter operating expenses,_
(ii) non-recurring business unit expenses (including redundancy payments and other related
personnel costs) and (iii) other “one off” or non- recurring gains and losses (including gains and
losses realized from the sale and acquisition of parking spaces to local residents and gains and
losses realized on the sale of parking facilities).

**_Net turnover_**
Our net turnover increased by 4.8% from €98.5 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016 to
€103.2 million in the six months ended June 30, 2017, notwithstanding the expiry of the Plaza de
España in Madrid, Stansted Airport (“Stansted”) and Alcobendas contracts. The increase in net
turnover was mainly due to (i) improved economic conditions in Iberia, which had a positive impact on
the majority of our off-street concessions and certain of our on-street concessions, and (ii) expansion
of our asset portfolio. Our asset portfolio grew primarily as a result of (i) our consolidation strategy to
acquire smaller companies in Iberia including EMSA, Sient and Menacho, (ii) the acquisition of the
remaining stakes in companies in which we had a majority interest including Estacionamentos,
Alhóndiga and Aparcamientos Bilbao, and (iii) the award of new contracts (off-street: Complejo
Hospitalário de León, Infante Santo and Brasilia; on-street: Porto; off-street management: Gatwick).

**_Other operating income_**
Other operating income decreased from €0.3 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016 to
€0.1 million in the six months ended June 30, 2017. Other operating income in 2016 was primarily the
result of an indemnity that we received from the Amadora Town Council in 2016.

**_Adjusted Revenue_**
Adjusted Revenue increased by 4.8% from €98.2 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016 to
€102.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2017, primarily as a result of improved economic
conditions in Iberia and the increase in off-street contracts.

Adjusted Revenue from our off-street concession business increased by 10.6% from €47.3 million in
the six months ended June 30, 2016 to €52.3 million in the six months ended June 30, 2017,
notwithstanding the expiry of certain contracts, such as the Plaza de España in Madrid, San Bernardo
and Les Terreses. The increase in adjusted revenue was mainly due to increasing demand across the
portfolio and an increase in the number of our assets, namely under the contracts of Menacho,
Complejo Hospitalário de León, Infante Santo and Brasilia.

Adjusted Revenue from our on-street concession business increased by 2.4% from €33.3 million in
the six months ended June 30, 2016 to €34.1 million in the six months ended June 30, 2017,
primarily as a result of the award of new contracts, such as Porto, Xàtiva, Villalba and Los Llanos.
During this period, the contracts of Alcobendas, Errenteria, Ayamonte and Sabadell expired.

Adjusted Revenue from our off-street contract management business decreased by 6.3% from
€17.6 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016 to €16.5 million in the six months ended June


-----

30, 2017, mainly due to additional services at Gatwick as well as higher pass-through costs (i.e. costs
that are initially paid by us and then invoiced to management at Gatwick).

**_Variation in stock of finished products and products in process_**
Variation in stock of finished products and products in process decreased from €0.4 million in the
six months ended June 30, 2016 to €0.2 million in the six months ended June 30, 2017.

**_Supplies_**
Supplies decreased by 25.0% from €0.4 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016 to €0.3 million
in the six months ended June 30, 2017, primarily as a result of the increasing digitalization of our
business leading to a decline in the consumption of parking tickets and stationery.

**_Staff costs_**
Our staff costs remained stable at 0.3% from €40.5 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016
compared to €40.6 million in the six months ended June 30, 2017, primarily as a result of new
contracts added to our portfolio and the expansion of contracts, namely our on-street contract in
Madrid where we increased the number of parking spaces that we manage, being offset in part by a
reduction in headcount following the expiry of certain contracts, namely Stansted.

**_Other operating expenses_**
Other operating expenses increased by 13.7% from €24.1 million in the six months ended June 30,
2016 to €27.4 million in the six months ended June 30, 2017, primarily as a result of an increase in
variable rents linked to contract performance and increased operating expenses relating to new
contracts.

The following table shows the components of other operating expenses for the relevant periods.

our portfolio of off-street assets, which typically comprise significant upfront costs.

**_Provisions and loss through unrecoverable receivables_**
Provisions and loss through unrecoverable receivables decreased by 35.0% from a gain of
€0.2 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016 to a loss of €0.5 million the six months ended

**_Financial result_**
Financial result decreased by 1.1% from €17.5 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016 to
€17.3 million in the six months ended June 30, 2017, primarily due to deleveraging, as well as lower
interest expense as a result of a decrease in the rate of EURIBOR during the period, which is used to
calculate the rate of interest payable under our Existing Revolving Credit Facility and local credit
facilities.

**_Corporation tax_**
Corporation tax increased by 50.0% from €0.6 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016 to
€0.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2017, driven primarily by an increase in our result for
the period.

**_Results attributed to minority interests_**
Losses attributed to minority interests increased from €0.1 million in the six months ended June 30,
2016 to €0.2 million in the six months ended June 30, 2017, primarily as a result of an increase in the
losses of companies within the Group in which third parties hold a minority interest.

**_EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA_**
EBITDA increased by 3.6% from €33.4 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016 to €34.6 in the
six months ended June 30, 2017, primarily as a result of improved economic conditions in Iberia
having a positive impact across our off-street and on-street concessions, as well as (i) our
consolidation strategy in Iberia, (ii) the acquisition of minority stakes in companies in which we have a
majority interest and (iii) the award of new concessions. Adjusted EBITDA increased by 5.3% from
€33.8 in the six months ended June 30, 2016 to €35.6 in the six months ended June 30, 2017 for the
same reasons.

Our net turnover increased by 6.3% from €189.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 to
€201.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily as a result of increasing demand
under a majority of our contracts and the award of new concessions, such as Hospital Gregorio
Marañon and Serrano car park in Madrid, three off-street concessions in Istanbul, the on-street
concession in Porto and the contract with Gatwick. In 2016, certain of our on-street concessions
expired and were not retendered such as our on-street contract in Lisbon and certain contracts have
not been renewed including the Chiclana, San Cugat and Alcobendas on-street concessions.

**_Other operating income_**
Other operating income decreased by 22.2% from €0.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2015
to €0.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily as a result of a decline in other
non-recurring revenue relating to compensation from the Vila Real Government and the settlement of
a Lisbon on-street contract.

Our Adjusted Revenue increased by 6.3% from €189.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2015
to €201.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily as a result of improved economic
conditions in Iberia having a positive impact across the majority of our off-street and on-street
concessions, as well as (i) the acquisition of minority stakes in which we already held an equity
interest including Etacionamentos Alhóndiga and Aparcamientos Bilbao, and (ii) new concessions
(off-street: Hospital Gregorio Marañon, Serrano car park in Madrid, and three in Istanbul; on-street:
Lisbon; off-street contract management: Gatwick).

the year ended December 31, 2015 to €98.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily

in the year ended December 31, 2015 to €68.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2016,

€30.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 to €34.2 million in the year ended December 31,

Variation in stock of finished products and products in process increased from €0.1 million in the year
ended December 31, 2015 to €0.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. This variation was

Supplies decreased by 25.0% from €0.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 to €0.6 million
in the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily as a result of a decrease in the purchase of tickets at
automated ticket machines and stationery.

€82.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily as a result of costs incurred with new
contracts having significant staff requirements such as the Porto on-street contract and the Gatwick
contract.

**_Other operating expenses_**
Other operating expenses increased by 14.4% from €42.4 million in the year ended December 31,

Share in results of equity-consolidated companies decreased by 11.1% from €0.9 million in the year
ended December 31, 2014 to €0.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily as a result
of an impairment recognized by Parques do Tamaris – Sociedade Exploraçao de Parques de
Estacionamento, S.A.

**_Corporation tax_**
We had corporation tax of €2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to
€0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This change was primarily driven by a decrease
in results attributed to the Group.

**_EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA_**
Our EBITDA decreased by 11.4% from €74.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 to
€66.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily as a result of the disposal of the Sevilla
car park in Madrid in 2014. Adjusted EBITDA increased by 3.7% from €65.4 million in the year ended
December 31, 2014 to €67.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily as a result of
the positive contribution from newly awarded contracts.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**
We had cash and other equivalent liquid assets of €23.7 million as of June 30, 2017, compared
to €21.3 million as of June 30, 2016. As of June 30, 2017, after giving pro forma effect to the
Transactions, our cash and other equivalent liquid assets would have been €26.1 million.

The following table shows our statement of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015
and 2016 and for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2017.

**_Cash flows from operating activities_**
Our on-street concession business generally requires greater working capital, due to the dynamics
associated with the payment of receivables from municipalities under the relevant concessions. Our
off-street concession business generally have negative working capital, due to the immediate
collection of tariffs from car park users (if they do not pay then they cannot exit the car park) and the
receipt of payment for season tickets in advance. Generally, our working capital is fairly stable with
minimal effects from seasonality.

We seek to maintain a business model that enjoys negative working capital primarily as a result of
the direct payments we receive from end users of our off-street parking facilities.

The following table sets forth a reconciliation of our results for the period before tax to cash flows
from operating activities for each of the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016 and the six
months ended June 30, 2016 and 2017.

For the six months ended June 30, 2017, our cash flows from operating activities consisted of a cash
inflow of €29.9 million, driven primarily by the positive performance of existing contracts and improved
economic conditions in Iberia. Working capital increased to €2.4 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2017, driven primarily by an increase in debtors and other account receivables, mainly due
to a delay in payment from the Madrid municipality of approximately €1.7 million, and a decrease in
creditors and other account payables.

For the six months ended June 30, 2016, our cash flows from operating activities consisted of a cash
inflow of €25.7 million, driven primarily by adjustments for the amortization of fixed assets totaling
€13.3 million and financial expenses of €17.6 million, in part offset by an increase in working capital.
Working capital increased to €8.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016, driven primarily by
the accounting treatment of an on-street contract in Madrid under IAS 18 (€1.5 million) and the
deterioration of client accounts (€1.3 million).

For the year ended December 31, 2016, our cash flows from operating activities consisted of a cash
inflow of €64.2 million, driven primarily by adjustments for the amortization of fixed assets totaling
€26.9 million and financial costs of €35.0 million. Working capital increased to €4.6 million for the year
ended December 31, 2016, driven primarily by the accounting treatment of the on-street contract
noted above (€2.8 million) and the deterioration of client accounts (€3.8 million).

For the year ended December 31, 2015, our cash flows from operating activities consisted of a cash
inflow of €62.2 million, driven primarily by adjustments for the amortization of fixed assets totaling
€27.4 million and financial costs of €34.5 million. Working capital resulted in a €0.9 million outflow,
driven primarily by the decrease of other current liabilities.


-----

For the year ended December 31, 2014, our cash flows from operating activities consisted of a cash
inflow of €48.3 million, driven mainly by adjustments for the amortization of fixed assets totaling
€27.2 million and financial costs of €36.3 million. The cash inflow was in part offset by a cash outflow
of €19.6 million, driven primarily by non-recurrent items such as the payment of costs relating to the
issue of our Existing Notes (€5.0 million, which were provisioned but not paid at year end), one-off
payments in connection with the car park resident spaces business (€1.5 million), payments linked to
contract terminations which were accounted for at the end of 2013 but were not yet paid and working
capital movements linked to ordinary course of business.

**Cash flows from investment activities**
We invested an aggregate of €91.8 million in car parks between January 1, 2014 and June 30, 2017.
Specifically, we invested €19.7 million, €16.1 million and €37.7 million in the years ended December
31, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively, and €18.3 million in the six months ended June 30, 2017. As
of June 30, 2017, we had approximately €33.8 million in outstanding capital commitments for
constructing new car parks and financing recent car park acquisitions, of which we expect to invest
approximately €1.4 million in the second half of 2017 and the remainder until 2025.

During the six months ended June 30, 2017, our main investment activities related to the following
parking facilities:

-    Complejo Hospitalário de León: €7.4 million in connection with the acquisition of an on-street
parking facility in León, which has been completed and is fully operational;

-    Menacho: €3.9 million in connection with the acquisition of the shares of the company that
owns an off-street car park in Badajoz with 100 parking spaces and a Weighted Average
Remaining Duration of approximately 57 years, which is fully operational;

-    Sete Rios: €1.7 million in connection with the construction of an off-street parking facility in
Lisbon, which we expect to be completed in the first quarter of 2018; and

-    Valladolid: €1.8 million in connection with an on-street concession in Spain, which is fully
operational.

outflow of €37.8 million, driven primarily by investments in the city of Porto, the acquisition of EMSA
and Sient and the acquisition of several off-street assets. In addition, we invested approximately
€2.6 million in relation to maintenance and renewal capital expenditures.


-----

For the year ended December 31, 2015, our cash flows from investment activities consisted of a cash
outflow of €16.1 million, driven primarily by investments in the construction of an off-street car park in
Lisbon (Infante Santo), the renewal of on-street contracts (Palencia) and newly awarded contracts in
the United Kingdom. In addition, we invested €3.8 million in relation to maintenance and renewal
capital expenditures.

For the year ended December 31, 2014, our cash flows from investment activities consisted of a cash
outflow of €10.8 million, driven primarily by investments relating to the acquisitions of Car Parking,

For the six months ended June 30, 2017, our cash flows from financing activities consisted of a cash
outflow of €7.7 million, driven primarily by debt repayment including payment of interest expenses
and borrowing funds to finance the acquisitions of Construcciones Calle Menacho and the concession
of Complejo Hospital de León.

For the six months ended June 30, 2016, our cash flows from financing activities consisted of a cash
outflow of €3.2 million, driven primarily by interest payments of €14.4 million, in part offset by the
incurrence of debt with credit institutions.

For the year ended December 31, 2016, our cash flows from financing activities consisted of a cash
outflow of €26.9 million, driven primarily by €28.8 million in interest charges, which was offset by
raising additional debt in the amount of €1.7 million.

For the year ended December 31, 2015, our cash flows from financing activities consisted of a cash
outflow of €39.2 million, driven primarily by the amortization of €22.5 million of debt and the issuance
of €11.4 million of debt in 2015. In addition, we issued an additional €4.5 million of debt to finance the
acquisition of three assets in Istanbul.

For the year ended December 31, 2014, our cash flows from financing activities consisted of a cash
outflow of €50.7 million, driven primarily by the amortization of €41.5 million of debt.

**Capital expenditure**
Capital expenditure primarily relates to expansion capital expenditure, which is linked to the
expansion of the business (acquisition and grant of new contracts or concessions) and depends on
specific requirements from new contracts awarded. Maintenance capital expenditure has historically
represented approximately 1% of revenues and mainly relates to car park contract requirements
(mainly recurring maintenance works and repairs on car park facilities to ensure they remain fully
operational and compliant). Renewal capital expenditure relates to on-street investments which are
required in concessions near to their maturity date.

The following table sets forth our capital expenditure for the periods indicated:

The following table sets forth a breakdown of our capital expenditures by business line for the periods
indicated.


##### �Capex by business line (€mm)


In 2016, expansion capital expenditure increased to €35.1 million compared to €12.3 million in 2015,
mainly due to on-street capital expenditure for the new Porto ORA contract (€9.7 million) and offstreet capital expenditure related to Parque Brasilia and Infanto Santo in Portugal (€4.4 million and
€2 million, respectively) and Hospital Ramon y Cajal (€2 million). Capital expenditure in 2016 also
included the impact from the acquisition of the remaining 50% stake of Alhóndiga, EMSA, EMSA Way
and Consequi (€9.8 million).

**Available liquidity**
Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and other equivalent liquid assets, cash flows from
operations and our Existing Revolving Credit Facility. Following the completion of the Offering, our
Existing Revolving Credit Facility will be repaid and terminated, and replaced by our €75.0 million
Revolving Credit Facility, of which we do not expect to draw under as of the Completion Date. See
“Use of Proceeds”. As of June 30, 2017, after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions, our total
indebtedness would have been €547.1 million, consisting of €475.0 million outstanding under the
Notes and with €75.0 million available under our Revolving Credit Facility. See “Capitalization”. For
further details with respect to our indebtedness, see “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements”
and “Description of Notes”.

We extend performance bonds and guarantees provided by banks to local authorities for our
performance under our concessions agreements. The aggregate face amount outstanding under
these performance bonds and guarantees was €47.3 million as of June 30, 2017 and no amounts
were drawn under such performance bonds.

**_Hedging transactions_**
Currently, we hedge our variable rate obligations through the use of interest rate swaps. As of June
30, 2017, we had swaps in place to hedge outstanding debt obligations in the amount of €33.6 million
under our Existing Revolving Credit Facility and Project Finance Facilities. We intend to unwind and


-----

terminate our outstanding interest rate swaps that we previously entered into in connection with
certain Project Finance Facilities and certain loans that we plan to refinance as part of the Debt
Repayment.

In respect of our recourse debt, only the acquisition of Construcciones calle Menacho involves an
interest rate derivative.

**_Cash collections_**
As a result of day-to-day activity at our parking locations, we collect significant amounts of cash. For
our off-street concessions, we collect cash in advance for hourly, daily and monthly charges, and use
a portion of this to pay the fees to the concession owners. For our on-street concessions, we
generally collect cash daily at the time of service, with the cash in excess of our fees remitted to the
municipalities at fixed intervals. For our off-street contract management business, we collect the cash
from users and net it against payments owed from the facility owners and pay the remainder to the
facility owners as required under the contract. Some municipalities and other clients require us to
deposit the cash receipts into client accounts and the clients then reimburse us for our fees.

**_Contractual obligations_**
The following table shows our contractual obligations due by period as of June 30, 2017 (excluding
accrued interest and amortized costs), after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions.

(1)  Represents non-recourse project financing arrangements entered into by certain of our non-wholly owned subsidiaries to
finance the construction of parking infrastructure under concession contracts. “Non-recourse” means that the lenders under
the facilities have recourse only against the subsidiary that is the borrower under the arrangement (and its assets and, in
some cases, its capital stock), and not to other members of the Group. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements
_—Project Finance Facilities”._

(2)  Represents capital lease (or finance lease) obligations entered into to finance the construction of parking facilities, among
other things.

(3)  Represents other credit lines and facilities.

(4)  Does not include (1) a €2.8 million deferred payment relating to the acquisition of Construcciones Calle Menacho;
(2) borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, which borrowings may be drawn, repaid and redrawn at any time; and
(3) annual concessionary fees to municipalities we are required to pay under many of our concessions. We do not expect to
draw under the Revolving Credit Facility on the Completion Date. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
_New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement”._

We are required to pay annual concessionary fees to municipalities under many of our concessions.
Fixed fees paid to municipalities amounted to €2.3 million in the six months ended June 30, 2017,
€2.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 and €3.4 million in the years ended December 31,
2015 and 2014.

**_Off balance sheet arrangements_**
Aside from the performance bonds, guarantees and operating leases described above and any nonrecourse factoring that we may undertake from time to time, we do not utilize any forms of off balance
sheet arrangements.


-----

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk**

**_Interest rate risk_**
Our primary market risk exposure consists of risks related to changes in interest rates. The Floating
Rate Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility and most of our local credit facilities bear interest at variable
rates. This exposes us to fluctuations or variability in interest payments due to changes in interest
rates. If interest rates increase, our interest expense will also increase, and conversely, if interest
rates decrease, our interest expense will also decrease. Additionally, increases in interest rates would
cause financing to be more expensive for future projects and acquisitions and would increase the
cost of our short-term debt. Currently, we hedge our variable rate obligations through the use of
interest rate swaps. We intend to unwind and terminate our outstanding interest rate swaps that we
previously entered into in connection with our Existing Revolving Credit Facility. We may decide to
undertake hedging with respect to the Floating Rate Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility or any other
variable rate obligations we may have outstanding in the future.

**_Foreign currency risk_**
We are exposed to foreign currency risk on those transactions or assets and liabilities that are in a
currency other than our reporting currency, the Euro. This exposure is currently limited in our
business, with our primary foreign currency exposures relating to the British pound and the Turkish
lira. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our operations in the United Kingdom and Turkey
amounted to 11.0% and 1.5% of our net turnover, respectively.

**_Liquidity risk_**
Liquidity risk is the risk of not being able to fulfill present or future obligations if we do not have
sufficient funds available to meet such obligations. Liquidity risk arises mostly in relation to cash flows
generated and used in financing activities, and particularly by servicing our debt, in terms of both
interest and capital, and our payment obligations relating to our ordinary business activities.

We believe that the potential risks to our liquidity include:

- a reduction in operating cash flows due to a lowering of net turnover from our operations, which
could be due to downturns in our performance or the industry as a whole;

- adverse working capital developments; and

- exposure to increased interest rates in relation to our borrowings that bear interest at a variable
rate, including our Floating Rate Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility.

If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources (including borrowings under the
Revolving Credit Facility) are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity
needs, we may be forced to:

- reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditures;

- reduce or delay our planned acquisitions;

- sell assets;

- obtain additional debt or equity capital; or

- restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity.

We cannot assure you that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely
basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all. In addition, the terms of our debt, including the Notes and the
Revolving Credit Facility, limit our ability to pursue these alternatives, as may the terms of any future
debt.

**Critical Accounting Policies**
This “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”
discusses our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS.
Accounting estimates are an integral part of the preparation of the financial statements and the
financial reporting process and are based upon current judgments. The preparation of financial


-----

statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reported period. Certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their
complexity and the possibility that future events affecting them may differ materially from our current
judgments and estimates.

This listing of critical accounting policies is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all our
accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically
dictated by IFRS, with no need for management’s judgment regarding accounting policy. We believe
that of our significant accounting policies, the following policies may involve a higher degree of
judgment and complexity.

**_Revenue and cost recognition_**
We recognize revenue when it can be reliably valued and it is probable that we will receive the funds.
In the case of our off-street concession business, this occurs when we receive fees from our clients,
which are recognized on an accrual basis for season ticket holders. In the case of our on-street
concession business and off-street contract management business, revenue is recognized at the time
the service is provided based on the set fee we are entitled to receive plus, in most cases, the
incentive payment, which is based on the funds collected. We must make a calculation in order to
determine the amount of revenue earned as an incentive payment, and sometimes we also need to
determine if and how to allocate certain costs, which can involve judgment on the part of
management.

When we sell off-street parking spaces, we recognize both expenses and revenues at the time of
delivery, which is generally when the contract is signed. This requires us to allocate costs of a
particular project to the space at such time. Generally, we allocate costs by allocating the construction
cost associated with the parking spaces sold. We perform this allocation based on an engineering
report prepared by an external advisor.

**_Impairment of goodwill_**
We perform a yearly impairment test to identify any instances where book value is greater than the
recoverable value of goodwill. Since our goodwill consists of individual car parks acquired upon prior
acquisitions, we calculate impairment by comparing the value of these assets with fair value. Typically
fair value is based on the price at which the asset could be sold, but since there is often no relevant
market comparison, especially for concessions, we typically use a discounted future cash flow model
in this analysis. This model requires us to make assumptions about estimated future cash flow, the
risk-free discount rate, the risk of the asset and market premium. Additionally, we include in our model
an estimate of any residual value based on renewal of the contract and growth. If any discrepancies
are identified in the course of our annual impairment testing, we write-down book value to the fair
value of the asset.

**_Taxes_**
We recognize income taxes based on both the current taxes and any deferred taxes that relate to the
current period. Due to differences in depreciation and other accounting policies used in determining
our income taxes, our tax payments often occur in a different period than the period in which profits
are recognized for accounting purposes. We recognize assets or liabilities for amounts expected to
be paid or recovered from tax authorities. In making these determinations we only recognize tax
assets to the extent that we believe there will be future taxable profits which could be used to
compensate for temporary differences. For these purposes, we must make calculations relating to
when expense items will be recognized for tax purposes and whether our future income will be
sufficient to allow us to use such deductions and tax credits recognized as assets.

**Introduction**
Parking plays a pivotal role in transportation, building design, quality of life and environmental issues.
Generally, the parking infrastructure and management business, and in particular the concessionbased portion of the industry, has lower demand risk and limited direct competition. Additionally, the
industry benefits from a degree of regulatory protection and stability because it provides a critical
service to municipalities. The number of car parking spaces has been growing in Iberia mainly driven
by GDP growth and the unemployment rate as well as a result of the increase in urbanization and an
increase in the number of cars. The profitability of the sector is generally improving, supported by
scale efficiencies, the implementation of cost savings programs and the utilization of innovative
industry technology, among other factors.

**Market segmentation**
The car park industry can be divided into three general categories:

-    Off-street concessions: Consists of parking in purpose-built facilities which can be located on
private land or, more commonly, commissioned by the local authority on public land as part of
its urban planning activities. Users can rent car park spaces by the minute, hour, day, week,
month or year. Parking spaces may also be sold to local residents for a single lump-sum
payment. Concessions are awarded via a public tender process and often require the winning
party to build or upgrade a parking facility. Given the required initial capital investment, offstreet concessions generally have longer terms than on-street concessions, typically up to 20
to 50 years, depending on the type of contract. A concession agreement regulates the tariff
which can be charged by the concessionaire, which is linked to inflation or another agreed
formula.

-    On-street concessions: Consists of parking in dedicated parking bays located “on the street”.
As part of its urban planning activities, municipalities will identify parking zones which are
reserved for local residents, zones available for general parking and zones for mixed use.
Municipalities limit the area of on-street car parking and generally outsource the management
and enforcement of on-street parking to specialized firms via a public tender process. If a
concessionaire wins a public tender for an on-street concession, it normally will not face any
competition for that concession until the concession agreement expires and a new awardee
starts to operate the service. On-street concession length typically runs from five to 20 years
and are typically structured either on a “cost plus fee” basis with low demand risk, or on a basis
where the concessionaire pays an up-front fee to the municipality but retains all the on-street
revenue and therefore bears demand risk.

-    Off-street contract management: Off-street contract management activities consist of private or
public entities outsourcing the day-to-day management of off-street parking facilities. These
contracts tend to have more variable terms than concessions and generally are for shorter
terms. Additionally, the bidding process for these contracts is more competitive and, as a result,
margins on these contracts tend to be lower than with concessions. Off-street contract
management arrangements with private entities are typically structured so that the parking
operator pays an annual rental charge to the parking infrastructure owner and in return retains
all the revenue, effectively bearing all the demand risk. Contracts with public or quasi-public


-----

entities typically carry less demand risk because the operator’s compensation is primarily an
annual inflation-linked fee for managing the parking operation.

The off-street concession business is Empark’s largest business line, representing 50.5% of the
Adjusted Revenue and 85.8% of Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended June 30, 2017.
The on-street concession and the off-street contract management represented 33.5% and 16.0% of
the Adjusted Revenue, respectively, and 14.2% and 0% of the Adjusted EBITDA in the twelve months
ended June 30, 2017, respectively.

**Business models**
The major off-street car park companies mainly operate under one of two separate businesses:

-    Concessionaire: Under the concessionaire model, the operator constructs the facility which is
referred to as a “green field” concession or pays a fee to the municipality for an existing facility
which is referred to as a “brown field” concession and enters into an agreement with the
municipality for the exclusive right to operate, maintain and invest in car parking activities for a
given number of years. The concessionaire generally pays an upfront fixed sum or an annual
fee (which can be fixed and/or be based on a percentage of revenue) to the municipalities.

-    Car park operator: Under the car park operator model, the operator enters into a contract
management arrangement with a private client to operate the parking facility. Typically, the
operator collects the revenues generated from users and pays the client a fixed fee or a fee
plus a percentage of revenues. Therefore, the operator retains most of the demand risk, which
can result in lower revenues and margins during economic downturns, because in many cases
parking facilities owned by private clients are not located in as favorable locations as facilities
developed by municipalities and other public authorities.

These two business models have significant differences, with the concessionaire model generally
requiring an initial investment in exchange for concessions with higher margins, longer terms and
generally lower levels of demand risk. The car park operator business model is subject to more
intense competition due to lower barriers to entry and short contract duration. We operate primarily
under the concessionaire model. Due to the fundamental differences between the models, we believe
the car park operator model is not fully representative of our business and we believe our business
more closely resembles the business of infrastructure companies operating under long-term
concessions.

**Car parking locations**
The car park industry can be divided into various segments with different characteristics:

-    City Centre

    - High frequency/supply constraint

    - 24 hour operation

-    Office

    - Control of access (visitor, staff)

    - Mainly daily parking 5/7 days

**Key characteristics of the concessionaire car park industry**
The concessionaire car park industry benefits from several characteristics that are exhibited by
infrastructure assets:

- Demand risk: Demand risk for parking operators is primarily driven by location and contract type.
On-street parking concessions typically have low demand risk since the operator’s income is
primarily based on a fixed fee. Off-street parking concessions have a higher demand risk which is
closely tied to location, however, for attractive locations in city centers or near hospitals or other
locations with consistent traffic, demand risk is lower.

- Limited direct competition: We believe that car park users typically do not park more than a short
walk from their ultimate destination. Therefore, for off-street parking facilities, competition is
essentially on a street-by-street basis, restricted to small geographic areas near the parking facility
which tends to be limited, especially for prime locations in city centers. For on-street activities, the
typical concession provides for a territory defined by the municipality and, as such, there is no
competition for other public on-street parking. For off-street activities, planning permission for
“green field” developments is generally difficult for developers to obtain given limited space. As a
result, competition between industry players is normally focused on the tender process. Once a
tender is awarded, operators are generally able to accurately estimate demand for their parking
facilities.

- An essential asset for municipalities: Parking, in all its forms, has become a fundamental amenity
used by municipalities in city planning and for transit regulation, especially as oversights in
planning can lead to negative consequences on the traffic and functionality of the city. Local
governments in Europe have increased the amount of overall area used for parking under
management which includes both regulated on-street areas and areas off public thorough fares.
Beyond city planning, municipalities look to parking as one of the most basic and essential services
they provide to businesses, commuters and tourists. Parking also provides a reliable source of


-----

revenue for municipalities, with low capital intensity. As a result, municipalities have a vested
interest in ensuring the availability and reliability of high-quality parking in their jurisdictions,
creating opportunities for the car park industry to continue to expand.

- Nature of customer base: We believe that the off-street parking categories of the car park industry
mainly cater to more affluent individuals such as professionals and other skilled workers that
commute daily to their workplaces and require parking spaces on a recurring basis. Demand from
this segment of the workforce tends to have a low level of elasticity and contributes to the stability
of volumes and revenues even during economic downturns.

- Capital intensity: For off-street parking concessions, there is typically a large initial capital outlay in
order to build the facilities; however, relatively low levels of capital expenditures are required to
maintain the facilities over the term of the contract. Minimal capital is required for on-street parking
concessions.

- Manageable operating cash costs: The car park operator’s ongoing cash cost base consists
primarily of labor costs, which can be increased or decreased with some flexibility, especially when
compared to other infrastructure assets. This labor flexibility can provide potential cost savings
when employee productivity increases through the use of technology.

- Regulatory regime: Concessions are governed by public laws and regulations in Spain, Portugal,
France, UK, Andorra and Turkey are similar to those that govern toll roads and other public
concessions. As a result, concessionaires, unlike car park operators, have benefitted from financial
rebalancing provisions contained in such laws and in Terms of Tender in some circumstances.
These provisions require the municipality to compensate the concessionaire (amending the
contract) if fundamental changes occur in the economic arrangements of the contract after its
execution. See “Regulation”.

**Market developments**
Several factors have contributed to the development and improvement of the car park industry in
Europe and Iberia.

- Macroeconomic recovery: Parking demand and growth is primarily driven by macroeconomic
factors including gross domestic product (“GDP”), inflation, regulation and employment. GDP
growth and the unemployment rate are the main macroeconomic factors impacting disposable
income, and therefore, retail, business traffic, petrol, consumption and car parks. Specifically, the
Spanish off-street market size evolution is highly correlated to both GDP and employment.
However, the car park industry is more resilient to macroeconomic changes compared to the toll
road and airport sectors given the lack of clear substitutes.

- Urbanization and growth in number of cars: The car park industry has an inherent growth factor
due to population and the continued increase in urbanization. As population levels grow, the
number of cars tends to increase leading to higher demand for parking, especially in city centers
where the supply is rigid due to the difficulties of developing new infrastructure in these areas.
Over the last decade, the number of people in urban areas has increased to approximately 75% of
the European population (Source: European Environment Agency). Continued urbanization
contributes to the growth of the car park industry. Between 1995 and 2015, the number of cars
owned has increased from 380 cars per 1,000 residents to 573 cars per 1,000 residents in the
European Union. According to the DBK Report, the Spanish General Traffic Office (Dirección
General de Tráfico, DGT) and ACAP Portugal, in 2014, there were approximately 27 million cars in
Spain and Portugal. The increasing number of cars on the road, combined with continued
urbanization, is a significant contributor to demand for car parking services.

- Increase value added services: The car park industry can benefit from providing consumers with
value-added services, including electric vehicle charging docks, car washing services, bicycle
rentals, package deliveries and mobile telephone coverage. These services can result in increased
revenue sources and higher levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty.

- Technology utilization: The car park industry has begun to develop technology that leads to more
profitable and efficient operations, and responds effectively to user needs. Innovations in the
automation of car park management systems, electronic payments systems and advancements in
centralized control systems and operations are important developments in off-street parking
facilities, which reduce the amount of labor required, making management more efficient and


-----

effective. Technology platforms are being utilized for our on-street parking operations in order to
more efficiently manage the area covered by the concession.

- Electric Vehicles: The demand and market share for electric vehicles is continuing to increase
rapidly. Off-street parking is a prime location for charging vehicles with car park operators
compensated for use of the charging stations. This can result in opportunities for larger parking
operators to work with local municipalities to provide city wide solutions.

- Autonomous vehicles: Autonomous vehicles could benefit car parking operators with a
technological platform able to accommodate the new technology for autonomous vehicles in the
long-term. Technologies under development include systems enabling autonomous vehicles to
know where off-street car parks are located and drive autonomously to the available locations.
Only car parks connected to a digital platform will take advantage of self-driving-cars.

- Car sharing: The declining importance of private car ownership and increase in car sharing is
expected to have a mixed impact on the car park industry, with limited impact in smaller cities
compared to urban areas due to the required scale for car sharing and potential traffic control
aimed at discouraging private car use. Car sharing can result in lower levels of private-cars
purchased and thus end demand for car parks. However, car parks will be the natural destination
to pick-up and park a shared vehicle.

- Outsourcing: Using a car park company often leads to cost savings and complementary income for
the operators such as hospitals, municipalities and shopping malls.

- Environmental: As the environmental impact of urbanization becomes an increasingly important
issue for local authorities, parking planning and parking fees are important tools for municipalities
to control the volume and flow of traffic.

- Traffic control: There are growth opportunities for more parking facilities within cities, even in
mature markets throughout Europe. As densely populated cities continue to develop, municipalities
may seek to increase the amount of available parking through the development of additional
underground parking structures. Additionally, as municipalities increasingly view paid parking as a
means to generate revenue, municipalities are increasing the number of metered on-street parking
spaces, which tends to result in higher demand for off-street parking spaces. In some cities in
Europe, municipalities have implemented congestion charges and other measures to reduce traffic
and benefit the environment. However, we believe that it is unlikely such measures will be
implemented in Spain or Portugal as public transport is well developed and we believe such
measures would be politically unpopular.

**Spanish car park industry**
The car park industry in Spain has a long history, with concessions going back to the 1960s.
The Spanish Association of Car Parks and Garages (ASESGA), which was formed in 1977, has over
1,000 company members that manage an estimated 906,001 parking spaces in 1,709 lots, garages
or parking zones in Spain. According to the DBK Report, there are circa 1.5 million on-street and offstreet parking spaces throughout Spain, 49% of which are on-street parking and 51% of which are
off-street parking, including car parks in residential areas, short-term parking structures in hospitals,
airports and shopping centers among others. There has been an increase in the supply of parking
spaces in Spain in response to, amongst others, rising population levels in urban areas and an
increase in automobiles.

According to the Organisation Internationale des Constructeurs d’Automobiles (OICA) in 2015, Spain
accounted for 9.1% of all the cars in use throughout the European Union. Thanks to the economic
recovery of the Spanish economy and the reduction in its unemployment rate, the purchase of new
automobiles has increased at a higher rate than the EU median; ACEA reported that in 2016 Spain
accounted for approximately 1.1 million new passenger car registrations which represented 7.8% of
all new passenger car registrations in the Europe Union (ranked 5th after Germany, UK, France and
Italy).

According to the DBK Report, the car park industry in Spain has a market size of €990 million
measured by recurring revenue in 2016. For purposes of this “Industry” section, recurring revenue
refers only to rentals and excludes sales of parking spaces, publicity or other revenue. The DBK


-----

Report estimates that in 2016, the five largest parking operators accounted for roughly 52% of the
total market. Additionally, there is a large “tail” of smaller participants with highly localized operations.

On-street parking is increasing in Spain, as it is commonly becoming an important component of
urban planning. We have also observed a trend towards outsourcing the management of facilities in
public places such as shopping centers, hospitals, train stations and universities. The autonomous
communities of Cataluña and Madrid in Spain and Lisbon in Portugal account for the largest
concentration of off-street parking spaces, totaling 42% of all operating parking spaces as of June 30,
2017 in Iberia. The autonomous communities of Andalucía and Valencia account for the second
highest concentrations out of the Spanish regions, with 10% and 6% of the total amount, respectively,
in 2016.

As indicated by the graphs below, according to the DBK Report, the car park industry in Spain
exhibited resiliency during the economic downturn, experiencing only minor decreases in market size
between 2008 and 2012 at a CAGR of (1.2)%. After reaching a floor in 2013, the Spanish park
market has grown at a CAGR of 2.1% from 2013 to 2016, in line with the evolution of its GDP.
Even though the number of cars has remained relatively stable since 2011, the evolution of new
registrations due to car renewals has been very positive with an accumulated growth of 59% for the
period from 2013 to 2016.

In addition, as already described, there has been an increase in the supply of parking spaces in
Spain due to increased population levels in urban areas and more cars. The number of parking
spaces (on-street plus off-street) has increased over the last five years as shown in the graph below:

**Portuguese car park industry**
In Portugal, the development of the car park industry began to accelerate in the 1990s with the
initiation of municipal auctions for car park concessions. According to the DBK Report, in 2016 there
were 250 car park companies in Portugal managing 285,000 park spaces, out of which 185,000 are
off-street parking spaces and 100,000 regulated on-street parking spaces. In 2014, the Portuguese
Association of Cars (ACAP) reported that there were 4.5 million cars in Portugal. While the total
number of cars remained stable as compared to previous years, the ACEA reported approximately
207,000 new private vehicle and SUV registrations in 2016. The city of Lisbon and Porto accounted
for over 37% of total vehicles in 2014. In 2014, the density of cars in Portugal was 431 cars per 1,000
inhabitants below the European average of 499 cars per 1,000 inhabitants.

In 2016, the total market size measured by revenue of the car park industry was €112 million.
Of 2016 turnover in the industry, 77% came from off-street parking management. The car parking
market in Portugal is geographically concentrated, principally in the areas of Lisbon and Porto which
accounted for 9% and 4% of total off-street parking spaces in 2016, respectively, in the Iberian
region. Construction projects for new car parks in other areas have also been completed in recent
years, and there is increasing expansion of regulated on-street parking in mid-size towns. The
number of car parking spaces in Portugal has remained stable for the period from 2012 to 2016 with
almost the same amount of spaces however the mix between off- and on-street spaces has changed
slightly.

The graphs below exhibit the strong growth the Portuguese car park industry market experienced
before the economic downturn and the resiliency of the industry during the last several years.
The parking market in Portugal has rebounded in recent years growing at a CAGR of 3.3% from the
low in 2014 to 2016 on the back of macroeconomic recovery. The parking market in Portugal is
currently below the peak reached in 2010 of €116 million, providing room for sustainable growth in the
upcoming years.

**Competition in Iberia**
We compete with a range of large, medium and small-sized operators in each of our three business
lines. Many of our competitors have larger proportions of on-street concessions and off-street
contract management, in particular with private entities. Additionally, many of our competitors focus
on specific regions of Iberia. Competition tends to depend on the nature of the contract or
concession.

We believe that most customers generally do not park more than a short walk away from their
destination, and competition tends to be concentrated in small areas. Accordingly, the competition
between different parking options is limited, especially in city centers and other densely populated
areas. Our experience has been that competition in Spain and Portugal from new car parks is limited
given the difficulties and economic impracticality of building new facilities in prime locations.
Additionally, given the high level of car usage and limited alternative forms of transport, there is
limited competition from public transportation. Due to these factors, the primary area of competition
among different car park operators is in winning new concessions and renewing existing concessions.
For off-street parking concessions, competition is essentially on a street-by-street basis with on-street
parking and off-street parking alternatives. Competition is minimal for prime locations since the high
density of city centers and planning regulations make the approval process for “green field” car parks
difficult. Therefore, concession operators, especially those in prime locations, typically face limited
competition within the local area near the facility.

For on-street parking concessions, there are several barriers to entry such as the required technology
and relevant administrative qualifications. As a result, the on-street parking concession business is
concentrated among a limited number of operators, one of which is Empark. Once an operator has
won a concession, the operator is granted exclusive rights on the on-street parking within the
concession area. Additionally, since fixed fees form a significant part of the relevant remuneration of
on-street concessions, the according exposure to demand risk is limited.

The off-street contract management sector has lower barriers to entry than on-street parking
concessions and competition among operators for contracts is more intense. Similarly to on-street
parking concessions, the remuneration under the contracts tends to come more from fixed fees, so
the operators have limited exposure to demand risk. Additionally, for contracts in certain locations
such as airports and ferries (which are the types of contracts Empark has in this sector), the parking
facility typically has no direct competition in the area.

and Portugal.

Note: Market size based on revenues has been obtained from the rentals of off-street and on-street parking spaces only (it does
not include revenues from sale of car parking spaces or other revenues obtained from publicity and/or other value added
activities).

AENA, Barcelona Serveis Municipals and El Corte Ingles have not been taken into account when
determining the market share of the top 5 operators, but they have been included to reach the total
market size.


-----

This is because they are owners of parking spaces but not operators. The difference in market share
when comparing market share by revenues to car parking spaces illustrates the different dynamics
and prices of on-street concessions and off-street concessions.

For example, EMEL has a higher market share by car parking spaces (20%) than Empark but has
only 21% of the market share by revenues while Empark similarly has 20% market share by car
parking space but 33% of the market share by revenues. Empark is a market leader in the Iberian car
parks industry both in terms of car parking spaces and revenues, and was the number one car park
operator in each of Spain and Portugal in terms of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016.

# Regulation

The following is a brief summary of the regulatory regimes of Spain and Portugal applicable to our
business.

**Spain**

**_General_**
Car parks in Spain may be developed either privately or through the public concessionary regime.
Car parks developed through the public concessionary regime are usually located on publicly owned
land and involve the exercise of public administrative powers (principally by municipalities). The legal
regime governing car parks developed through the public concessionary regime is more complex
than that for private car parks. This is the reason why this section is almost entirely devoted to car
parks developed through the public concessionary regime. The operation of public car parks, which is
usually granted to private parties under administrative concessions, is subject to the ongoing control
of the public authorities that grant the concessions.

Car parks that are privately developed are usually built on privately owned land and are subject to a
less complex regulatory regime than the regime applicable to car parks developed through the public
concessionary regime.

Law 40/2002 of November 14 regulates car park agreements and sets forth the duties of car park
operators and their liabilities for personal injury and property damage.

Under the relevant Spanish laws, the operator of a parking facility is liable for any damages to the
vehicle and its contents. The provider of parking services is liable for movable components,
accessories or objects when certain conditions are met, including that such movable components,
accessories or objects are expressly declared by the user, that the provider of parking services
expressly accepts their custody, and that the user complies with security measures.

**_Off-street Car Parks_**
Off-street car parks can be classified as follows:

a)    Ownership: The asset is owned by the company and is freely operated exclusively for its own
benefit. A parking contract with end users is ruled by Law 40/2002 on vehicle parking which
(since its amendment by means of Law 44/2006) sets forth that the price to be paid by the user
must be established by minutes of parking use without being able to charge for parking time
that has not been consumed. Law 40/2002 sets forth the duties of car park operators and their
liabilities for personal injury and property damage. In particular, according to the law, the
operator of a parking facility is liable for any damages to the vehicle and its contents.

b)    Contract with a third party (public or private body):

i.    Public contracts are typically awarded by municipalities who “own” the (car park) public
service. Although they can be formally subdivided in two different types of concessions,
the main features of both types are very similar.

       -    Public Works Concession: The concessionaire constructs and further exploits the
car park or it only operates the car park already constructed.

Those subject to the Law of Contracts with Public Authorities, a consolidated text
approved by Legislative Royal Decree 2/2000 of June 16 (“TRLCAP”) may have a
maximum term of: (i) 40 years if they are concessions for construction and
operation or (ii) 20 years if they are concessions only for the operation of the car
park.

Those subject to the current Public Procurement Law 3/2011 may have a
maximum term of 40 years.

       -    Concession for the management of a public service (which may also include
carrying out some works).


-----

Those subject to the Public Procurement Law 923/1965 may have a maximum
term of 99 years.

Those subject to the Public Procurement Law 13/1995 may have a maximum term
of 75 years.

Those subject to the TRLCAP or to the current Public Procurement Law 3/2011
may have a maximum term of: (i) 50 years if they include construction and
management or (ii) 25 years if they are concessions only for the management of
the car park.

Some of these contracts include a Public Domain Concession granted under the
Public Assets Law 33/2003, which may have a maximum term of 75 years. As a
consequence, the maximum duration for those contracts is 75 years.

ii.    Private “Concessions” comprise contracts that are signed with a private entity to build
and/or operate a car park, the contract being subject to private common civil or
commercial law and not subject to specific term constraints (nor are they derived from
the regulations on public contracts).

iii.    Management contracts comprise private contracts awarded by a public or by a private
entity. If the awarding entity is a public entity, such as AENA, regulations on public
contracts shall apply to the awarding process, but the terms and conditions under which
the contract is executed are those set out in the contract itself and, accordingly, common
civil or commercial law will apply. Thus, management contracts are not subject to any
maximum term (nor are they derived from the regulations on public contracts).

**_On-street Car Parks_**
Municipalities are the “owners” of the on-street car park public service. Thus, its operation or
management always derives from a contract awarded by a municipality. On-street car parks fall under
the following categories:

a)    Concession for the management of a public service. According to the TRLCSP, these contracts
may have a maximum term of 25 years.

b)    Service contract: The operator provides a service and receives a payment in exchange.
According to the TRLCSP, these contracts may have a maximum term of four years with a
possible extension of two additional years.

**_Legal framework_**
The construction and operation of off-street parking facilities and the provision of on-street parking
services pursuant to contracts awarded by public authorities are regulated by public procurement
regulations currently, the TRLCSP. (Contracts awarded prior to the effectiveness of the TRLCSP are
governed by the public procurement legislation in force when such contracts were awarded: Public
Sector Contracts Law, 30/2007 of October 30 (the “LCSP”), TRLCAP, Law 13/1995 of May 18, on
Contracts with the Public Authorities or Decree 923/1965, dated April 8, approving the State Contract
Law.

In addition, contracts entered into with municipalities are also usually governed by the regulation
ruling local entities services, approved by the Decree of June 17, 1955, as currently in force. In
addition, certain regions of Spain have enacted their own legislation. For example, in the Catalonian
autonomous region, Decree 179/1995 of June 13, approves the regulation of local entities works,
activities and services (“ROAS”).

In addition to the aforementioned regulations, concessions are governed by the corresponding
contractual documents which may include additional requirements to those foreseen in said
regulations, such as specific corporate requirements for the concessionaire or change of control
provisions.


-----

**_Public tender process and award_**
Concessions for the construction and/or management of public car parks, as well as for the provision
of on-street parking services, are awarded through a public tender process. In this public tender
process, interested parties may submit their bids for the contract. The specific conditions of the
contract are set forth in the terms of tender (Pliegos de Condiciones Administrativas y Técnicas) (the
“Terms of Tender”) and in the contract itself. These conditions may differ and establish particular
legal, economic and technical terms for each type of contract and for each project without prejudice
to the application of the relevant public procurement legislation in effect at the time the contract is
awarded.

**_Term and renewal of administrative concessions_**
Within the maximum term established by the relevant applicable law, each particular contract will
have the duration of the contract set out in the Terms of Tender approved for the contract.
Additionally, the contractual term may only be extended under the circumstances set out in the Terms
of Tender and within the maximum extension terms mentioned therein. However, the concessionaire
does not have a right to such an extension; the administration may grant it or not.

The regulations on public contracts are becoming increasingly stringent as far as the extension of
public concessions is concerned and so are consequently the different administrations. This new
tendency, driven by EU regulations, does not affect the duration already established under
concessions already awarded (although it may impact on the decision for granting extensions) and
will only apply to future concessions awarded after the date indicated in the Directive 2014/23/EU of
the European Parliament and of the Council of February 26, 2014 on the award of concession
contracts (“Directive 2014/23”) (i. e. April 18, 2014).

Upon expiration of the contractual term (and its possible extensions, which necessarily need to be
granted or agreed in writing) the contract is terminated. The authority will then decide whether it
wants to award a new contract in a new open tender process or if it prefers to provide the car-park
service directly itself.

**_Powers of the awarding authority_**
The awarding authority is entitled to interpret the concession contract, resolve any doubt regarding its
execution, modify it for reasons of public interest, terminate it early and determine the effects of such
termination. Decisions adopted by the awarding authority are immediately enforceable (even if the
concessionaire is allowed to challenge such decision before the tribunals and to request their
precautionary suspension).

More specifically, the awarding authority is entitled to exercise its “ius variandi”: contractual
modification carried out by the public administration for public interest reasons that may affect the
characteristics of the service provision or the tariffs to be paid by users. If the modification affects the
financial contractual regime, the administration will need to compensate the concessionaire in order
to maintain the financial balance of the concession.

**_Restoring of the economic balance_**
Public works concessions and concessions for the management of public services are subject to risk
(and venture) assumed by the concessionaire, which basically means that the concessionaire runs
the business at his own risk, including the need to carry out at his own expenses certain investments
such as technological updates, and is only entitled to request a compensation if any of the following
events occur (the administration may also initiate a proceeding to re-balance the concession for its
own benefit):

(a)   Ius variandi: mentioned above.

(b)   Factum principis: Any other action carried out by the public administration not directly modifying
the contract but which directly produces a “substantial imbalance” in the contractual economics
(for example, under certain circumstances, the opening by the same administration of another
car park which competes with the one awarded).

(c)   Unpredictable risk: Any unforeseeable event, in which none of the contracting parties
intervenes, which produces a “substantial imbalance” in the contractual economics. In these


-----

events, the “risk” is shared by both the administration and concessionaire, who will not be
entirely compensated.

(d)   Force majeure.

Compensation, which can eventually also take place in favor of the administration, may include a
modification of the tariffs to be paid by the users, the shortening or extension of the contractual term
or any other modification of the economic clauses contained in the contract.

**_Concession tariffs and other remuneration arrangements_**
The Terms of Tender and the contract establish the tariff scheme to remunerate the concessionaire.
In exchange for operating the car parks, the concessionaires are generally required to pay a fee to
the granting authority.

Usually off-street car parks are remunerated in accordance with the use of the parking spaces. Thus,
short-term parking spaces (rotación) are usually remunerated by a regulated tariff. The right of the
concessionaire to increase the tariffs to be paid by end users depends on what it is set forth in the
contract and in the Terms of Tender. Traditionally, amendments to tariffs had been linked to the
national, regional or sectorial CPI.

However, the recent Spanish Economy De-indexation Law, approved on March 30, 2015, provides
new rules for the review of monetary values in the contracts in which the public sector intervenes,
establishing a regime based on the principle of said monetary values not being modified by virtue of
price indexes or formulas that contain the same. In any event, this new regulation has no retroactive
effect and should not affect contracts awarded before its enforcement.

In addition to the tariffs for the rotary use of the car park, as an ancillary activity, the concessionaire is
in some cases allowed to sell the right of permanent use for a certain number of years of a limited
number of parking spaces to local residents for a price established in the contract, in accordance with
the Terms of Tender. Note that in some concessions there is a ratio between rotation and assignment
of use that is compulsory for the concessionaire. It is also permitted in many concessions to sell
subscriptions to users for shorter terms (monthly, weekly or daily passes, among others).

Other sources of income may be advertising within the car park, assignment of certain parking spots
to specific users such as hotels, or the implementation of ancillary activities such as car washing.
However, these additional sources of income may be limited by the Terms of Tender or even
forbidden. Note that the concessionaire may also be required to assign some parking spots to the
granting authorities free of charge as part of the contractual arrangements.

On-street concessionaires are generally remunerated through a flat fee or by reference to a
percentage of the amount collected for the provision of the service less costs. Increase of tariffs to be
paid by end users need to be authorized by the granting authority.

The Terms of Tender and the contract establish the fee scheme that the concessionaire has to pay to
the granting authority. This fee may be due with certain regularity or may be payable upfront. Failure
to comply with fee requirements is generally a cause of termination of the concession.

**_Assignment of the concessions and change of control_**
The assignment of the concession is in general, subject to the prior granting authority’s consent, to be
granted after having verified that all requirements are met. The most relevant requirement is that the
assignee shall evidence before the granting authority that it has the ability to operate the concession.

The transfer of the concessionaire’s shares (implying or not a direct change of control) is in general
not expressly foreseen in the contractual documentation or in the relevant procurement regulations.
However, in some cases, restrictions apply (e.g. obligation to notify or to obtain prior approval).

Indirect transfer of the concessionaire’s shares (indirect change of control) is in general not expressly
foreseen in the contractual documentation or in the relevant procurement regulations (e.g. port
regulations do refer to this). However, in some cases the granting authority may understand that an
indirect change of control is subject to its prior approval when it implies a change of control.


-----

This interpretation is often based on the Spanish State Council doctrine set out in its report
3375/2001, in which it considered that the transfer of a controlling stake in the concessionaire may be
considered to be a transfer of the concession, for which consent is required.

Other corporate transactions may also be subject to specific requirements.

In addition, it should be noted that concessions entered into with the City Councils located in
Catalonia are governed by the ROAS. According to the ROAS, the transfer of the shares of the
concessionaire company without the authority’s prior approval is a termination event if it implies a
change of control. Note that, as per the second transitory provision of the ROAS, this regulation
applies to administrative procedures started after its enforcement. Indeed, there is Case Law stating
that the ROAS applies also to concessions granted before its enforcement. Therefore, we cannot rule
out that some City Councils in Catalonia consider that the ROAS shall be applied also to concessions
granted before its enforcement. In addition, it cannot be ruled out that the authority considers that the
ROAS subjects the indirect change of control of the concessionaire to authorization.

Failure to comply with these requirements may lead to the termination of the concession for which the
concession will be held liable.

**_Security over concession_**
The mortgage of a concession requires in general the prior approval by the granting authority. This
authorization will be without prejudice to the second authorization which will be required upon
enforcement of the mortgage (see Assignment section above). The contractual documents may
foresee the need to obtain the granting authority’s prior approval for the placement of additional
security relating to a concession. In this regard, note that for example placing a pledge over the
compensation or other credit rights that the concessionaire is entitle to receive upon early termination
in public works concession awarded post-enforcement of Law 40/2015, of October 1, 2015, is subject
to the granting authority’s prior approval.

Failure to comply with these requirements may lead to the termination of the concession for which the
concession will be held liable and may imply the pledgee is not regarded as a privileged creditor.

**_Guarantees, insurance and other obligations with economic impact_**
Concessionaires are required to place economic guarantees before the granting authorities and
maintain them during the whole life of the concession. These guarantees respond for the obligations
that the concessionaire has vis-à-vis the granting authority. Although there is a certain freedom for the
concessionaire to choose how to place this guarantees, it is generally made by means of a bank
guarantee.

It is often the case that the Terms of Tender require that the concessionaire has certain insurance
policies in place during the whole duration of the concession, covering in general third party liability
and damages to the car parks. The Terms of Tender normally do not require these insurance policies
to be specific for a given car park, thus it allows that this requirement is met through global insurance
policies of the concessionaire.

Finally, it should be noted that the Terms of Tender may include the obligation for the concessionaire
to make specific investments either at the beginning or during the duration of the concession.

Failure to comply with these requirements may lead to the termination of the concession for which the
concession will be held liable.

**_Early termination events and consequences_**
The different regulations on public contracts (1965, 1995, 2000 and 2011) provide for certain events
that may trigger the early termination of the concession contract, each of them having particular
consequences. In general, causes of termination are: (i) extinction of the legal personality of the
contracting company; (ii) declaration of insolvency in any other proceeding of the concessionaire; (iii)
mutual agreement between the administration and the concessionaire; (iv) failure of the contractor to
provide the final guarantee or the special guarantee or complementary guarantee of the latter in time
in the cases provided for under law and the non-formalization of the contract in due time; (v) delay in
the fulfillment of the deadlines by the concessionaire; (vi) payment failure by the administration; (vii)


-----

failure to comply with other essential contractual obligations; (viii) rescue of the concession or
suppression of the service by the Administration and (ix) those causes of termination that are
expressly established in the contract.

Generally, the concessionaire has the right to be compensated under law for the following: (i) the
non-amortized value of the land, premises and equipment used for the provision of the service which
revert to the administration, and (ii) the loss of value of any other investment made in works and
installations that do not revert to the administration.

If the early termination event is attributable to the concessionaire, damages and losses caused to the
administration will need to be indemnified by the concessionaire.

Additionally, in some cases in which the early termination event is attributable to the administration,
the concessionaire is also entitled to be compensated with the loss of profits and other damages. In
certain municipalities, there is the possibility of the administration recovering the service awarded, the
so-called “rescue” of the public service or public work by the administration”, which means the
unilateral declaration of the contracting body, discretionally adopted, by which it terminates the
concession, notwithstanding the good management of the concessionaire.

**_Reversion and eventual exit payments_**
After conclusion of the concession contract the public service and/or the public works must revert to
the administration in an adequate state for its use and without any compensation.

According to the relevant municipal regulations on public contracts, the concession contract shall
determine the works and installations which will need to revert to the municipality by expiration of the
concessional term. The regulations on public contracts also provide that prior to the reversion taking
place, the administration will adopt the relevant measures so that the reversion of the works and
installations is carried out according to what is agreed in the contract. This may entail the need for the
concessionaire to carry out the relevant works or, eventually, to provide the administration with an exit
payment if the works and installations are not in an adequate state for its use. In addition, some
contractual arrangements may foresee the need to make specific payments to the authority upon
termination.

**Portugal**

**_General_**
As in Spain, in Portugal car parks may be developed either privately or through the public
concessionary regime. Similar to Spain, car parks developed through the public concessionary
regime are located on publicly owned land and involve the exercise of municipal administrative
powers relating to the regulation of traffic and local public highways. The legal regime governing car
parks developed through the public concessionary regime is more complex than that for private car
parks. Car parks developed through the public concessionary regime are managed by a private party
under an administrative concession or similar arrangement granted by a public authority, and they are
subject to the ongoing control of the public authorities that grant the concession or arrangement.

Car parks that are privately developed are usually built on privately owned land and are subject to a
less complex regulatory regime than the regime applicable to car parks developed through the public
concessionary regime. The terms and conditions applicable to privately operated car parking facilities
are contractual in nature although subject to the applicable mandatory private law provisions.
Enforceability of rights under the above mentioned agreements towards third parties may depend on
their prior registration before the competent land registry offices, notably in the case of ownership
rights, surface rights and lease agreements with a term equal to in excess of six years. Private car
park operators are generally required to obtain municipal licenses in order to build and operate the
car park and are subject to certain legislation governing the car park industry, particularly with regard
to health and safety, tariffs and consumer rights. For example, Decree-Law 81/2006, of April 20,
which regulates the use and access conditions to car parks, is applicable to privately developed car
parks.

There is no specific legislation relating to the liability of car park operators for injury and property
damage in car parks and therefore the general liability rules of the Portuguese Civil Code are


-----

applicable. According to the applicable general rules, car park operators may be liable for injury and
property damage to the extent that the damage in question results from an intentional or negligent
violation of a third party right. In off-street car parks, car park operators may also be liable for
damages caused by third parties (for example theft) in cases where the car park operator assumes
an obligation to assure the safety of the vehicles parked. However, in most cases, car park operators
explicitly exclude these obligations in the terms and conditions of use posted in the facility for
damages caused by third parties to the vehicles parked. There are court decisions recognizing the
validity of this exclusion in situations where the car operator had included such exclusion in the
conditions of use posted in the facility.

The following summary covers car parks operated through the public concessionary regime and
accordingly subject to the public regulatory regime.

**_Applicable legislation_**
The construction and operation of public parking structures and on-street parking normally takes
place under concession agreements (typically for on-street parking) or under surface rights
agreements (typically for off-street parking), usually entered into with municipalities.

The construction and operation of public parking structures and on-street parking are regulated
through the enactment of public laws which govern the formation and execution of public contracts by
municipal regulations and by contractual arrangements with municipalities.

An administrative concession is used by public authorities to promote the development of public
works by private entities that will subsequently operate such public works (a “public works
_concession”) or to contract a private entity to operate a certain public service, in principle, without_
involving any kind of construction (a “public service concession”), although some public service
concessions may imply also some construction works as an ancillary obligation.

A surface right is a right to build and maintain a certain construction for a specified period of time over
the property of the granting authority. Surface rights agreements entered into with public entities for
the construction of off-street parking facilities whilst subject to the rules applicable to the formation
and execution of public contracts as referred to above may also be subject to private law.

The concessions for the construction and management of parking facilities and on-street parking are
currently regulated in Portugal through the Public Contracts Code, approved by Decree-Law 18/2008,
of January 29 (“Public Contracts Code”). The Public Contracts Code includes provisions relating to
the formation, execution and termination of concession agreements. Prior to the Public Contracts
Code, these agreements were regulated by Decree-Laws 59/99, of March 2 (that governed public
works contracts), and 390/82, of September 17, that also imposed certain rights and obligations with
respect to any concessions granted by unicipalities. These prior laws still govern the concession
agreements which formation procedures were initiated before the Public Contracts Code was
enacted. One of the most relevant differences between the Public Contracts Code and the former
legislation with regard to administrative concessions is that, upon the enactment of the Public
Contracts Code, the duration of an administrative concession is no longer subject to a strict limitation
rule. Instead the duration of such contracts is determined in the contract in line with the period
required to amortize the investment and obtain remuneration under normal market conditions. In
addition, the concessions in the public domain are also subject to Decree-Law 280/2007, of August 7,
that sets forth the legal regime applicable to the management of public property. In some situations
the public-private partnership regulation set forth in Decree-Law 86/2003, of April 26, as amended by
Decree-law 14/2006, of July 27, or in Decree-Law 111/2012, of April 26 (which revoked Decree-Law
86/2003, of April 26), may apply.

Historically, the term limitation has caused public authorities to adopt surface rights agreements
(instead of concession agreements) in respect of off-street parking in order to allow longer duration
periods given that construction of parking facilities involves investments that could not be amortized
within such a short period of time. Surface rights are not subject to any specific term limitation.

According to the applicable rules, the construction and operation of off-street parking facilities with
respect to publicly owned land subject to the public domain legal regime (the “public domain”) should
take place under concession agreements and, conversely, the construction and operation of off-street
facilities with respect to publicly owned land not subject to the public domain legal regime (the


-----

“private domain”) could be made through surface rights agreements. In order to overcome the above
referenced term limitation applicable to concessions and due to this distinction, the general practice
adopted by municipalities has been to disaffect parcels of land from the municipal public domain and
re-incorporate those parcels in the municipal private domain precisely to allow the execution of
surface rights agreements in order to take advantage of the longer term permitted under surface
rights agreements.

Currently, the execution of surface rights agreements (in respect of public-owned properties) for the
construction of off-street parking facilities may also be subject to tender procedures established in the
Public Contracts Code (to the extent that they contain typical stipulations and characteristics of the
agreements subject to this Code) and, in addition, is subject to Decree-Law 280/2007, of August 7,
that sets forth the legal regime applicable to the management of public property. If the tender surface
right contracts are qualified as administrative contracts, then the execution regime of the Public
Contracts Code will also apply. Prior to the enactment of this legislation, the execution of such
surface rights agreements was also subject to Decree-Laws 59/99, of March 2, 390/82, of September
17, and 794/76, of November 5. These prior laws still govern older surface rights agreements which
formation procedures were initiated before the Public Contracts Code was enacted.

**_Public tender process and award_**
The public authorities enter into contracts with the private parties selected through tender processes
in which the interested parties may submit their tenders. The specific conditions of these contracts
are set forth in the Terms of Tender (“Caderno de Encargos”) and in the contract. These conditions
may differ among contracts and establish particular legal features for each specific project, while
using the aforementioned legal framework as a reference. Theoretically the grant of a surface right
could be made, according to Decree-Law 280/2007, of August 7, by direct award or through a
negotiated procedure, however, given the fact that the surface rights in question substantially contain
the typical elements of a concession, they are usually awarded through the aforementioned tender
procedures.

**_Types of contracts_**
The legislation contemplates various types of contracts. Typically, car parks may operate under three
different classes of contract: (i) a contract for concession of management of a public service without
works; (ii) a contract for concession of public works; and (iii) a surface rights agreement.

Most contracts for the operation of on-street car parks take the form of a concession for the
management of a public service without works, provided that it is not necessary to build any relevant
infrastructure for their operation.

Most of the contracts currently in force for the off-street car parks are operated under surface rights
agreements awarded by the municipalities, since, as discussed above, prior to the Public Contracts
Code’s adoption in 2008 concessions awarded by municipalities were limited to a term of 20 years.
Although even after the enactment of the Public Contracts Code the municipalities maintain the
previous trend of resorting to surface rights agreements for the off-street car parks, it is possible that
in the future car parks developed through the public concessionary regime will be more often
awarded through concession contracts.

**_Term and renewal of administrative concessions and surface rights_**
Currently, the applicable legislation does not impose a specific term limit for administrative
concessions. The law establishes that the duration shall be determined in the contract taking into
account the reasonable period of time required under normal market conditions to amortize the
investment and obtain a fair return on the investment. In the absence of such contractual clause
stipulating the duration of the concession agreement, the Public Contracts Code sets forth a 30-year
term.

Upon expiration of the agreement, the contract may not be renewed without a prior public tender
process. Nevertheless, under certain circumstances, the agreement may be extended provided that
such possibility had been contemplated by the contract, however rights and certain preference rights
for the grant of new surface rights may be deemed null and void.


-----

Surface rights agreements entered into in connection with publicly owned properties do not have a
statutory term limit but will have the term specified in the contract, in accordance with public interest
criteria and taking into account the economic balance of the service that will be operated under the
agreement. The applicable legislation does not allow the renewal of surface rights upon expiration of
the contract. Surface rights agreements normally have a long-term and, upon their expiration, a new
agreement will need to be executed following a public tender if the Public Contracts Code applies.
Otherwise, a limited, a negotiated or a direct award procedure could apply.

**_Economic-financial balance_**
In general, public contracts are executed based on the principle that the business risk is assumed by
the private entity.

Notwithstanding this, the law foresees certain situations that may lead to a modification of the terms
initially agreed in order to ensure that the public service is not affected in the face of abnormal and
unpredictable circumstances or unilateral modification of the contract imposed on public interest
grounds by the public entities. In light of the Public Contracts Code, the concessionaire or the holder
of a surface right (to the extent that such right contains typical stipulations and characteristics of the
agreements subject to the Code) is only entitled to the re-establishment of the economic balance of
the contract in the following situations:

(i)    when the circumstances upon which the parties have grounded their decision to enter into
contract suffer an abnormal and unpredictable modification imputable to the awarding authority
acting beyond the contractual frame; or

(ii)   when the agreement is modified by the public entity for public interest reasons.

According to the Public Contracts Code the means to re-establish the financial balance may be
included in the contracts. There are no legislative limits with respect to the mechanisms that may be
adopted, but often such mechanisms include revision of tariffs, adding parking spaces or a provision
stating that the authority and the concessionaire shall jointly seek an agreement to re-establish the
financial balance of the contract. In the absence of contractual provisions, the Public Contracts Code
(applicable to concessions and possibly to the surface rights agreements if the tender program
determines its applicability or because the contract is materially a concession contract) stipulates that
re-establishment of the balance shall be achieved through the extension of the contractual term,
through the revision of prices or through the payment of compensation. Any other situation involving
an abnormal and unpredictable modification of the circumstances will trigger the right to a
modification of the agreement or to receive compensation (without necessarily implying the reestablishment of the initial economic balance).

The legal framework applicable under the former laws to concessions and surface rights agreements
did not specify the rebalancing right and mechanism, at least in such detail. However, either by
appealing to general rules and principles of Law or through the use of contractual conditions
establishing the rebalance right, one could sustain such rebalancing right in similar situations and
therefore, from a practical point of view, the final applicable framework may not differ substantially
from the one currently in force.

There is no specific claim procedure prescribed by law to apply for the financial rebalancing of the
contract. Under circumstances that would trigger the rebalancing mechanism, the concessionaire or
holder of the surface right shall apply to the public entity within the contractual framework and in
accordance with the general rules applicable to contracts. In practical terms, a written notice should
be sent to the awarding entity stating the facts underlying to the request and the relevant legal
provisions and proposing the modifications required to maintain the economic balance of the contract.
Normally, this will entail a negotiation with the awarding entity. Should the latter accept the
modification or compensation proposed, this would typically be formalized by means of an
amendment to the initial agreement which would be effective as of its date of execution. In the
absence of a favorable decision or in the absence of a decision within a reasonable period of time, a
judicial claim may be filed with the administrative courts or with an arbitral tribunal in cases where the
agreement stipulates an arbitration clause, in order to obtain a ruling ordering the re-establishment of
the economic balance or the payment of compensation. The duration of a court process is difficult to
determine, as it depends on numerous factors, such as the number of appeals to be completed in
order to obtain a definitive judicial resolution (generally two appeals), or the volume of affairs


-----

affecting, in each moment, the competent court. Currently in Portugal judicial procedures in
administrative courts may last more than three years but there is no assurance the process will be
completed within this time frame.

**_Concession tariffs and other remuneration arrangements_**
The relevant Terms of Tender and the relevant contract establish the tariff scheme to remunerate the
concessionaire/holder of the surface right.

Normally with off-street structures the concessionaire/holder of the surface rights is remunerated
based on the collection of the tariffs established in the contract, which are reviewed periodically
based on the consumer price index. In addition, a fixed price or an annual amount may also be
payable by the concessionaire/holder of the surface right to the municipality in consideration for the
concession or surface right awarded.

With respect to on-street parking, normally the concessionaire agrees to deliver to the municipality a
percentage of the tariffs collected or, in some cases, a fixed amount and, in other cases, a
combination of a fixed amount plus a percentage of the tariffs. It is customary for the
concessionaire/holder of surface right to include the tariffs in its offer to tender and subsequently
propose to the awarding authority for its approval revisions of the tariffs as allowed by the contract.

**_Authorizations and change of control clauses_**
In some of the contractual arrangements, municipalities impose certain restrictions on the
shareholder of the concessionaire and the guarantees that such concessionaire can grant to third
parties, such as the need for prior authorization to create a mortgage over the concession or,
sometimes, change of control clauses.

Legislation relating to these matters does not expressly require prior authorization for share transfers
of the concessionaire or changes of control in it. Nevertheless, certain specific Terms of Tender and
contracts, or their interpretation by the awarding authority, may require prior consent for such
transactions. However, the applicable legislation expressly requires prior authorization for mortgages
or charges over assets included in the concession or over the surface right. The need for
authorization could also result from the fact that the public tender would have established
prerequisites for the qualification or the evaluation of the proposals that were met by the tenderer with
recourse of the parent company qualifications or expertise.

**_Termination of the concession_**
Under the current regulatory regime, apart from a termination resulting from contractual breaches,
concession and surface rights agreements may be terminated by the public entity as a result of the
following: (i) at any time due to public policy reasons, provided that appropriate compensation is paid
to the concessionaire/holder of the surface rights (to be calculated according to the contractual
regime or, in the absence of contractual provisions, in accordance with the law); (ii) unauthorized
assignment or transfer of the concession or surface right; (iii) unauthorized creation of mortgages or
other charges over the concession or surface right; and (iv) certain other situations specified in the
Public Contracts Code. In addition, the public entity may be entitled to assume the management of
the concession or surface right temporarily in case of severe breach of contract, such as the failure to
perform or pay amounts due. During such period the contract will be suspended and if the operation
is not resumed, the agreement may be terminated.

Contracts usually include provisions stipulating the formula that shall be used to calculate the
indemnity payable in event of early termination grounded on public interest. In general, the formulae
are designed to reflect an amount of indemnity calculated on the basis of the investment that was not
amortized and such formulae do not usually cover loss of profit, which needs to be claimed on the
basis of general principles under law. If the municipality and the concessionaire cannot agree on
compensation, the concessionaire may bring an action against the municipality.


-----

**_Liability and compensation for termination of concession contract_**
In the event of termination of the contract due to breach by the public authority, the authority will be
liable for payment of the loss and damage caused to the concessionaire/holder of the surface right.
Similarly, the termination of the contract due to intentional breach by the concessionaire/holder of the
surface right will result in such entity being liable to indemnify the authority for the loss and damage
caused. Such indemnification may be enforced initially against the guarantee created, if applicable.

# Business

**Overview**
We are one of the leading concessionaires and operators of parking infrastructure in the Iberian
Peninsula, as measured by number of parking spaces and revenues. We mainly operate
underground car parks (“off-street”), as well as some parking areas on city streets (“on-street”) under
concessions and surface rights agreements from public authorities. As of June 30, 2017, our portfolio
comprised 432 contracts in 189 municipalities and other contracts with customers such as AENA and
ANA, the respective Spanish and Portuguese public airport operators, under which we manage over
522,000 parking spaces in Spain, Portugal, the United Kingdom, Andorra, France and Turkey. For the
twelve months ended June 30, 2017, our net turnover was €206.0 million, our Adjusted Revenue was
€205.7 million and our Adjusted EBITDA was €73.2 million. Our operations in Spain and Portugal,
respectively, represented 67.6% and 20.6% of our net turnover, 67.6% and 20.6% of our Adjusted
Revenue, 68.8% and 28.8% of our gross profits, 68.4% and 29.8% of our Adjusted EBITDA and
75.9% and 11.8% of our parking spaces for the twelve months ended June 30, 2017.

We have served the Iberian market since the late 1960s. We believe this has given us a “first mover”
advantage, whereby we have continually secured long-term concessions and built a portfolio of prime
parking locations in Spain and Portugal, including in city centers, airports and other high density
traffic areas, such as hospitals and business districts. Due to a variety of physical, regulatory and
other constraints such as cost of space, we believe that there is limited opportunity to develop
alternative parking options in many of these prime areas, allowing us to benefit from captive demand
with limited competition.

**Strengths**
We believe that we have several competitive advantages in the car park sector in Iberia, including our
long-term contract revenues, diversified business profile, assets with low demand risk and market
leadership. As a result of these strengths, together with the stable regulatory environment and
favorable industry dynamics, our business benefits from a high level of stability and recurring cash
flows.

**_Uniquely positioned for growth on the back of Iberia’s favorable macroeconomic trends_**
The macroeconomic environment in Spain and Portugal, our largest geographic markets in terms of
revenues, has gradually improved since 2013 and is expected to continue to improve in the
foreseeable future. The on-going macroeconomic recovery in Spain and Portugal is mainly driven by
GDP growth and a decrease in unemployment rates, with the unemployment rate in Spain expected
to be 4.5% lower in the next five years, which are the main macroeconomic factors impacting
disposable income, and therefore, retail, business traffic, petrol, and overall consumption. The car
park industry has been growing in Iberia mainly driven by this macroeconomic recovery as well as a
result of the increase in urbanization and an increase in the number of cars. The profitability of the
sector is generally improving, supported by scale efficiencies, the implementation of cost savings
programs and the utilization of innovative industry technology, among other factors. We believe that
we are well positioned to benefit from the continued improvement in the economic environment in
Iberia resulting in organic growth opportunities for us. The economic recovery in Iberia may also lead
to consolidation opportunities that provide room for further non-organic growth. We believe that
improvements in our cost savings, business activity and revenues in connection with such economic
improvement, together with our various cost efficiency initiatives, will have a positive effect on our
EBITDA.

**_Leading car park concessionaire in Iberia benefitting from scale and high barriers to_**
**_market entry_**
We are one of the leading car park concessionaires in the Iberian parking infrastructure concessions
market both by revenue and number of parking spaces. As of June 30, 2017, we managed 397,012
parking spaces in Spain, 61,897 in Portugal, 54,672 in the United Kingdom, 4,575 in Turkey, 3,258 in
France and 1,425 in Andorra. We had over 20.5 million car parking transactions in the twelve months
ended June 30, 2017, based on the number of payments made across all our car parks. In 2016, we


-----

had a market share of approximately 16% based on revenues. Our size and growth have allowed us
to achieve significant economies of scale, and the scope of our operations, combined with the various
cost management measures we have implemented, have allowed us to maintain our Adjusted
EBITDA levels. For example, our centralized system controls and manages a substantial majority of
our off-street concessions business parking facilities from a remote location, which has allowed us to
reduce headcount and personnel costs without impacting our service quality and customer
satisfaction levels. Such efficiencies have led to significant savings in operating expenses as we
reduced the number of operators per car park by more than half. In addition, our mobile maintenance
personnel is responsible for the maintenance of several car parks within a defined geographic area,
which reduces personnel expenses and standby time. This has allowed us to reallocate personnel to
perform certain functions previously outsourced, thereby reducing our reliance on third-party service
providers. Our economies of scale enable us to be a consolidation platform for smaller Iberian
parking operations, and allow us to undertake valuable new concessions and acquisitions of smaller
players. For example, when we acquired Car Parking, S.L.U. in 2014, EMSA - Empreendimentos e
Exploração de Estacionamentos S.A. (“EMSA”) in 2015 and SIENT - Sistemas de Engenharia de
Transito, S.A. (“Sient”) in 2016, we integrated each company into our centralized system to reduce
the number of staff on site, ensured maintenance works were performed by dedicated local teams
and arranged for management services relating to human resources, tax or accounting, to be
conducted by centralized management teams. In addition, through our experienced management
team and our long-standing reputation in the industry, we have been able to develop and maintain
important relationships with the various municipalities with which we do business, thereby reducing
our dependence on any single local authority or region.

We believe the upfront cost and difficulty in obtaining planning permission to build new high density
car parks in city centers, together with the favorable regulatory regime that applies to concession
agreements in Spain and Portugal as discussed under “—Stable regulatory environment with
_downside protection” below, as well as the scale required to operate car parks efficiently present_
significant barriers to entry in the car park industry. The stringent regulatory framework governing
parking concessions in Iberia reduces the risk of new competitors entering the market. For example,
due to the terms and lengths of concession contracts, competitors can be locked-out of the off-street
concessions business for long periods of time. In addition, our size provides us with the scale
required to operate a car park portfolio efficiently. For example, our scale enables us to share
resources among our car parks including maintenance and supervisory staff, as well as management
resources in respect of accounting, marketing, human resources, insurance and tax matters. The
number of our locations also gives us a commercial advantage as we are able to anticipate customer
needs across multiple locations. In addition, the high initial investment required to produce efficient IT
resources is beyond the reach of smaller competitors. Between 2014 and June 30, 2017, we invested
approximately €3.9 million in IT resources. Unlike smaller operators, we can price into our bids the
efficiencies that we can generate through our portfolio, and thus offer more attractive terms to
municipalities. Also, as there is a lack of available land in the major city centers of Iberia, there are
limited opportunities to construct new car parks, and our scale provides us with numerous
consolidation and expansion opportunities, which many smaller competitors are unable to take
advantage of.

**_High degree of diversification_**

Our business benefits from a portfolio which is highly diversified in terms of the following: number of
contracts, number of municipality clients and types of parking services we deliver. We are also diversified
through our three business lines, each of which has different risk profiles and capital requirements, but with
similar operational and managerial requirements. As of June 30, 2017, we had 432 contracts including
298 off-street concession contracts (including 84 resident contracts), 123 on-street concession contracts
(including nine tow-away contracts) and 11 off-street management contracts with customers such as
AENA, ANA, Gatwick Airport Limited (“Gatwick”) and Edinburgh Airport Limited (“Edinburgh”). Our off-street
and on-street concession contracts were granted in 189 municipalities in Iberia. Our off-street concession
business line is further diversified in terms of location, municipality, end user and type of contract (business
district, hospitals, shopping areas and tourism). We believe our limited reliance on any single contract is a
significant factor in diversifying our source of revenues and therefore reduces our cash flow volatility. While
our 10 largest off-street car parks represented approximately 12.3% of our total gross profit for the twelve
months ended June 30, 2017, our largest car park represented less than 2% of our total gross profit during
the same period. We believe our diversified business portfolio differentiates us from other infrastructure


-----

companies, who typically rely on a smaller number of larger contracts or concessions, with a greater
concentration of risk.

**_Strategically located assets with attractive concessions and limited demand risk_**

We believe that our infrastructure portfolio is well invested. Our on-street concession and off-street contract
management businesses have low demand risk because we are generally paid a fixed fee for the services
we provide, regardless of occupancy of the car park. Although our off-street concession business is subject
to demand risk and fluctuations in volumes, we believe the prime locations of our concessions will continue
attracting car park users and ensuring stable utilization levels given our car parks are located in high traffic
areas at or within close proximity to city centers. Our business was created as a result of the acquisition of
the two historical leaders in the parking concessions market in Spain and Portugal, each with prime
concessions already in place. As a result, we were able to construct car parks in strategic locations,
including Playa de la Concha in San Sebastián, Plaza Mayor in Madrid and Camões in Lisbon, and take
advantage of the existing concessions which were located within close proximity to city centers and in high
traffic areas. Therefore, we believe that we enjoy a prime position in the relevant local area with respect to
a significant proportion of our parking facilities. Moreover, the high density of city centers together with
planning regulations make the approval process for “green field” concessions difficult, effectively limiting
the supply of parking spaces in a given area. Additionally, many of our concessions in strategic locations
have a long remaining life, such as Camões, Lisbon (34 years, 340 car spaces), Playa de la Concha, San
Sebastián (41 years, 1,274 car spaces), Joan de Borbó, Barcelona (22 years, 638 car spaces) and
Restauradores, Lisbon (30 years, 545 car spaces). The prime positions of our car parks and the difficulty in
building new car parks helps to reduce the demand risk in our off-street concession business.

**_Stable regulatory environment with downside protection_**
The regulatory framework governing off-street and on-street parking concessions in Spain and
Portugal affords certain protections to the concessionaire. We and other car park concessionaires
that operate in Iberia have historically benefitted from a “rebalancing” clause under the relevant
concession legislation in Spain and Portugal, which may also apply to Portuguese public surface
rights agreements. Under certain circumstances, a change in the balance of the economic terms and
conditions of the concession that is adverse to the concessionaire will trigger a right of the
concessionaire to seek compensation or a “rebalancing” mechanism, which typically results in either
an extension of the concession period, an increase in tariffs payable by users, or sometimes an
increase in the number of parking spaces managed by the concessionaire, depending on the
circumstances. This regulatory environment has proven to be stable and predictable since the
implementation of the concession system more than 50 years ago and in the past, we have been
successful in relying on such protective legislation to seek additional compensation. Additionally, the
municipalities granting concessions have an interest in the success of public car parks since they are
a source of income for the municipality and the operation of car parks satisfies a public need.

**_Highly stable business with limited maintenance capital expenditure requirements_**
For the twelve months ended June 30, 2017, 85.8% of our Adjusted EBITDA was generated by our
off-street concessions business, which had a Weighted Average Remaining Duration of approximately
25 years. Since 2014, we have achieved a Replacement Rate of approximately 235%. Our off-street
concessions business also benefits from regulated tariffs linked to inflation. Accordingly, we benefit
from a high level of recurring business and long-term visibility of cash flows, and we believe the longterm nature of our portfolio is matched by few other infrastructure companies in Spain and Portugal.
The most significant contracts in the off-street portfolio are public concession agreements, with none
or limited rent payments, which is not the case of a typical lease contract more common in other
European countries.

We have achieved a Replacement Rate of approximately 113% since 2014 with respect to our onstreet concessions business. During the same period, we achieved a Renewal Rate of approximately
71% in respect of on-street car parks we manage. In addition, we also won a number of our
competitors’ contracts and in some instances, we have successfully renewed our on-street
concessions business despite our competitors submitting more competitively priced bids than us. We
believe this is due to our superior technical competence, including the implementation of state of the
art revenue collection technology, and our wealth of industry experience.


-----

Despite the decrease in demand and volumes within our parking facilities that we experienced during
the prior economic downturn, we were able to mitigate some of the effects through inflation-indexed
price tariffs under the majority of our off-street and on-street concessions business and off-street
contract management agreements, as well as growth in our concession portfolio and our
implementation of cost management measures. The stability of our business and the resilience of our
Adjusted EBITDA during the economic downturn are illustrated in the chart below.


**Strong operational performance – Adj. EBITDA (€mm)**


Our business model shares all the key features of infrastructure companies, such as long-term cash
flow visibility, resilient revenue generation, long-term concessions and a favorable and stable
regulatory environment with certain protections for the concessionaire in case of regulatory or
administrative change. However, unlike some other infrastructure companies (including those
operating toll roads), our car parks, once operational, require relatively low levels of maintenance
capital expenditure. Our limited maintenance capital expenditures are a result of our scale and
preventive maintenance measures and low operating intensity. On average, between 2014 and 2016,
our annual total maintenance capital expenditure totaled €2.3 million, representing 1.2% of our
Adjusted Revenue during the same period and mainly relating to the requirements of our car park
contracts, including recurring maintenance works and repairs on our car park facilities to ensure that
they remain fully operational and compliant. As a result, we believe we are well positioned to benefit
from returns on these investments without the need to make significant maintenance capital
expenditures with respect to these facilities.

We benefit from attractive working capital dynamics with low levels of credit risk with respect to our
off-street concession business, since such revenues are collected from users when they exit the car
park. Our current business does not require significant investment in working capital. For example,
our off-street concessions business line generates negative working capital because our revenues
are generally collected when earned and our costs are paid according to standard payment terms as
agreed in each of our contracts. However, our on-street and contract management businesses have
higher working capital requirements as they are more dependent on the payment terms from
contracts with public bodies. In addition, our credit risk with respect to our on-street concessions
business is primarily with the municipalities rather than private third parties. As a result of our low
maintenance capital expenditures and working capital requirements, we have achieved significant
Free Cash Flow Conversion ratios of 87.1% and 91.3% for the year ended December 31, 2016 and
the twelve months ended June 30, 2017, respectively.

Any larger capital expenditures are primarily related to the expansion of our business, including new
acquisitions and grants of new contracts and concessions. We are constantly securing new contracts
and concessions as existing contracts and concessions expire. These are based on our analysis of
investment opportunities and are typically not linked to prior commitments. Capital expenditures
linked to the expansion of the business depend upon specific requirements from newly awarded
contracts. For example, in 2016 our capital expenditures included the impact of the acquisition of the
remaining 50% stake in each of Alhóndiga, Aparcamientos de Bilbao, EMSA and Sient (€9.6 million);
the new on-street contract in Porto, Portugal (€9.7 million) and off-street concessions business capital
expenditures related to Parque Brasilia and Infanto Santo in Portugal, and Hospital Ramón y Cajal, El
Ejido and Las Terrazas de Marbella in Spain (approximately €11.1 million). Additional capital
expenditures may be required in connection with the renewal of on-street contracts nearing their
maturity date. Our limited maintenance capital expenditure requirements and high Free Cash Flow
Conversion ratios are illustrated by the charts below.

#### Capex by type (€mm)

(1)  Maintenance capital expenditure mainly relates to car park contract maintenance requirements (mainly recurring
maintenance works and repairs on car park facilities to ensure they remain fully operational and compliant) prior to
termination of the concessions to operate such car parks but excludes the initial investment made under such contract.

(2)  Renewal capital expenditure relates to on-street investments which are required in concessions near to their maturity date.

(3)  Growth capital expenditure relates to new contracts added to the portfolio, namely a concession acquisition or an investment
made in newly awarded contracts.

(4)  M&A capital expenditure relates to new contracts added to the portfolio where we have acquired the share capital of the
company and not the asset itself.

(5)  Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow Conversion are non-IFRS measures. See “Presentation of Financial Information”. In
2014, our Free Cash Flow Conversion ratio was negatively impacted by a €19.7 million change in working capital, mainly
due to one-off payments relating to our refinancing and the commencement of significant off-street and on-street contracts.

(6)  Leverage is defined as Net debt divided by Adjusted EBITDA for the periods indicated.

**_Experienced management team with strong, supportive shareholders_**
Our senior management team has significant experience and understanding of the car park sector
and has an average of 14 years of experience in the industry and 12 years of experience with the
Company. Our senior management team has consistently over performed on budget targets, through
the successful integration of our businesses and significant cost savings achievements. This over
performance can also be attributed to the senior management team’s ability to anticipate and
embrace new trends and technology in the car park sector, which has enabled us to be a pioneer in


-----

the deployment of efficient improvement programs and user friendly applications, such as electronic
payment devices, license plate recognition systems and mobile applications.

In addition, our senior management team maintains strong and long-standing local relationships with
the relevant regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate.

We also expect to derive further benefit from the experience and financial support of the Macquarie
Group following the completion of the Acquisition. The Macquarie Group, through its MIRA division, is
the world’s largest infrastructure manager by assets under management, according to IPE Real
Estate, and a global leader in the creation and management of specialist funds which focus on
infrastructure, real estate and adjacent sectors. As of March 31, 2017, MIRA has more than
€110 billion of assets under management. MIRA’s European investment portfolio includes businesses
located in Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia,
Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom.

**Strategy**
Our key strategies are the following:

**_Maintain focus on growing revenue and improving EBITDA_**
We will continue to implement measures designed to increase our revenues and thus enhance our
EBITDA and cash flows. Generally, under our concession agreements, we are subject to limitations
with respect to the maximum tariff that we can charge users of our parking facilities. As a result, we
have the flexibility to structure our pricing policy as we deem fit so long as we do not exceed the
maximum tariffs set forth in the concession agreement. Our pricing policy varies on a case by case
basis, and we may use any or all of the following pricing mechanics in order to maximize demand
and volumes: (i) season tickets, whereby we can offer a range of different products to fit our
customers’ specific needs (for example, offering specific time slots on specific days or for specific
periods of time), which can help to increase volumes during those times of the day when rotation is
less intensive, as well as have a positive impact on our working capital as a result of receiving
payments in advance, (ii) different tariff structures, whereby tariffs will differ, for example, based on
the time of day or the day of the week, and (iii) long-dated sales, whereby we can expand our product
and service offering by developing special offers and promotions designed in partnership with third
parties, such as travel agencies in connection with holiday packages or special events.

We also seek to increase revenue and volumes within our off-street concessions business parking
facilities through increased deployment of car park signage and other forms of advertising in city
centers and other high traffic areas in which our car parks are located. In addition, we anticipate that
revenues from our large parking facilities opened in the past three years will increase over the
coming years as they are currently in the “ramp up” phase. Within our on-street concession business,
we seek to continue improving our revenue collection through the implementation of best practices,
such as our integrated platform for payment (Telpark) and visual car enforcement in order to increase
revenues collected for the relevant municipality, which will thereby increase the level of variable
incentive compensation we receive under such concession. Moreover, we intend to continue to
implement technological improvements to achieve greater efficiency, which will allow us to more
efficiently manage the parking areas covered by our on-street concessions business and increase the
number of parking spaces covered per employee. For example, we plan on increasing the number of
car parks, both from our existing portfolio and new acquisitions that will be connected to our
centralized control room in order to reduce fixed costs. Upon completion of the Acquisition, we aim to
realize further net cost savings of approximately €2.3 million consisting of overhead cost savings of
approximately €3.3 million relating to the departure of top management, partially offset by €1.0 million
in additional costs we expect to incur for the appointment of a new chief executive officer and new
chief financial officer. For further information, see “Management—Empark—Transitional Services
_Agreements”._

**_Maintain our disciplined and high operational efficiency_**
We will continue to focus on managing our business in a cost-efficient manner by using the latest
industry technologies and improving customer service. We will also continue to work with car
manufacturers to implement new technology systems. In the past, we have invested in and installed
several user-friendly IT applications to enhance the customer experience at our car parks including


-----

electronic payment devices such as Via Verde, license plate recognition systems and mobile
applications, such as Telpark, for both off-street and on-street car parking. We plan to continue to
improve and extend the application of our cost-effective practices, such as monthly contract-bycontract cost base reviews, the centralization of the daily management of our off-street concessions
business car parks from a remote location, our energy efficiency programs and our on-street
efficiency programs. Furthermore we will continue to maintain our well invested assets in order to
keep our required level of maintenance capital expenditure low, and we plan to eliminate certain
overhead costs not required for continued operations.

**_Preserve and selectively expand our high quality portfolio of long-term concessions_**
We have a diversified portfolio of concessions and contracts in prime locations and will strive to
maintain and renew these concessions and contracts in order to maintain our stable cash flow
generation. We believe our infrastructure is well-invested. The total expansionary capital expenditure
for the period from 2014 to 2016 was €57.5 million. As a result, we intend to focus our efforts on
renewing our portfolio of existing concessions and contracts by maintaining our well invested assets
in anticipation of future renewal capital expenditure requirements and organically expanding our
operations by capturing new concessions and contracts. For example, due to our market leading
position, scale and expertise, we believe that we are well positioned to continue to grow our
diversified portfolio by renewing our existing contracts and concessions and capturing new contracts
and concessions from both existing customers seeking to award new concessions and from other
organizations looking to outsource the management of their parking facilities. For example, in line
with our historical strategy, we may acquire high quality smaller car parks in prime locations and to
incorporate them into our centralized control room, which will increase our portfolio of assets that
benefit from our mobile maintenance personnel. Due to our scale, long-standing experience in this
industry and established relationships with municipalities, we are able to achieve significant synergies
that also allow us to offer more competitive terms than those offered by our competitors. We believe
our position as one of the leading concessionaires of off-street concessions and on-street
concessions parking in Iberia, combined with our long-standing relationships with a diverse number of
local authorities and favorable industry dynamics, including high barriers to entry, will assist us in
continuing to implement this strategy.

**_Strategic focus on off-street concessions business in Iberia_**
We will continue to focus on managing our core business segments within Iberia, principally the offstreet segment. We may opportunistically consider dispositions of non-core operations and
geographies, in order to enhance the risk profile of investment capital expenditures and improve
profitability. In addition, as part of our long-term strategy, we may consider strategic options regarding
the on-street concession business line, off-street contract management and business outside of Iberia
in order to fully focus on our off-street concession business, which has a higher EBITDA Margin.

**Off-street concessions**
Our off-street concession business is our largest business line, representing 85.8% of Adjusted
EBITDA for the twelve months ended June 30, 2017 and having a Weighted Average Remaining
Duration of approximately 25 years. This business line primarily consists of concessions with
municipalities to operate parking facilities and underground parking facilities. Under these contracts,
we are generally required to invest in the construction of a new parking facility (a “green field”
concession) or make an upfront payment to the municipality for an existing parking facility (a “brown
field” concession). As of June 30, 2017, we had 298 off-street parking contracts (including 84 resident
contracts) under this business line, consisting of approximately 124,350 parking spaces (including
32,881 resident parking spaces) in 84 municipalities, principally in Spain and Portugal. We have a
diversified client base with our 10 largest car parks represented approximately 12.3% of our total
gross profit for the twelve months ended June, 30 2017. We also have 17 off-street contracts and
concessions in Turkey (our total net turnover from Turkey was €3.0 million, or 1.4%, of our total net
turnover for the twelve months ended June 30, 2017 in respect of our off-street concession business),
the United Kingdom (our total net turnover from the United Kingdom was €21.3 million, or 10.3% of
our total net turnover, for the twelve months ended June 30, 2017 in respect of our off-street
concession business), Andorra (our total net turnover from Andorra was €1.0 million, or 0.5%, of our
total net turnover for the twelve months ended June 30, 2017), and, since April 2017, in France.


-----

Our portfolio comprises parking infrastructure located in urban areas and other areas of high traffic
density, such as hospitals, and business and administrative centers. Due to our early entry into the
Iberian car park sector, our concessions include a number of car parks with prime locations that were
originally constructed in the 1960s and 1970s. Many of these locations are in highly transited areas
that attract a large number of visitors for a variety of purposes with limited free or paid alternative
parking options. The area of competition is limited to the perimeter around the car park thus creating
a local monopoly. Demand for our off-street parking facilities in such areas experience relatively low
volatility and have remained relatively stable even during difficult economic conditions.

Generally under off-street concessions, we design, build, finance and operate underground and multistory parking infrastructure facilities. These “green field” concessions generally require us to invest
capital to build a facility or make an upfront payment to the municipality for an existing facility in
exchange for higher potential margins and long-term concession contracts. Under our “brown field”
concessions, we also pay an annual concession fee to the municipality. Under the concession (or
surface rights agreements, in Portugal), we charge the end users a tariff (or fee) for the use of the
facility. The fees are charged either on a per minute basis for short-stay tickets or on a daily, weekly,
monthly, seasonal or annual basis under a subscription arrangement. The fees paid by end users are
specified under the concession (or surface rights agreement) and generally automatically increase
annually in line with inflation to the extent such contracts were entered into prior to the Spanish Deindexation Law entering into force on February 5, 2017. We generally retain all fees generated from
operating our off-street parking facilities and are responsible for all expenses relating to operating and
maintaining the parking facility during the term of the contract. Our off-street parking facilities are also
subject to local taxes, for which we are responsible. We also generate a small amount of income
through some basic amenities we provide to car park users within our parking facilities, such as
vending machines and car washes.

In general, our off-street parking facilities are operated on a 24-hour a day/seven-day a week basis.
Most of the features of the parking facilities are automated, including entry and exit controls and ticket
machines. Users can obtain information about subscriptions and tariffs online and over the phone.
The car parks are staffed and operated by our own employees. We have introduced a centralized
system to control and manage a substantial majority of our off-street parking facilities from a remote
location, which has allowed us to reduce personnel costs by reducing headcount while maintaining
our high quality of services and customer satisfaction levels. Such efficiencies have led to significant
savings in operating expenses as we reduced the number of operators per car park by more than
half. In addition, such measures have helped us to reduce our reliance on external service providers
by enabling us to reallocate personnel to perform certain functions previously performed by third party
service providers. We are also able to realize certain economies of scale by using our on-street
concession employees in managing our off-street operations. Routine maintenance, including painting
and cleaning, and security for our off-street parking facilities are provided by both third party
contractors and our own employees. We have achieved strong like-for-like revenue growth of 5.89%
in June 2017, reflecting year to date growth of 5.1% as of June 30, 2017. The following chart sets out
our monthly like-for-like revenues from June 2016 to June 2017.

In Spain, contracts for the management of a public service can run for a maximum statutory term of
50 years if they include works and 25 years if they do not include works. Contracts for a concession
of public works can run for a maximum term of 40 years, extendable in certain circumstances for up
to another six years (or 15% of the initial term).


-----

In Portugal, the term of the concessions for the construction and management of parking facilities is
not currently subject to a strict limitation rule, but the duration of such contracts is determined in line
with the period required to amortize the investment and obtain remuneration under normal market
conditions. However, all concessions we currently operate in Portugal are subject to a prior legal
regime whereby the term of administrative concessions awarded by municipalities could not exceed
20 years. Notwithstanding this, 25 of our off-street parking facilities in Portugal are governed by
surface rights agreements with longer terms, such as our 99-year term Alexandre Herculano (Lisbon)
concession. Surface rights agreements entered into in connection with publicly owned properties do
not have a statutory term, but their term is contractually specified in accordance with public interest
criteria and taking into account the economic balance of the service that will be operated under the
agreement.

The vast majority of off-street concessions in Spain and Portugal are awarded as a result of a public
bidding process conducted by the municipalities. Each municipality has authority to determine the
location and economic viability of car parks within its jurisdiction.

As municipalities generally do not want to own and operate the parking infrastructure, the incumbent
concessionaire is normally well positioned to negotiate an extension of the term of the concession (if
permitted under the contract), or to obtain the renewal of the concession by using the information and
experience it has developed to bid successfully in the new public tender process.

In certain cases when new parking infrastructure is constructed, the municipality may require the
concessionaire to sell some parking spaces in the facility to local residents who typically pay the
concessionaire the acquisition price of the parking space in one single payment. We recognize
revenues for the sale of parking spaces at the time the parking space is sold, which coincides with
the time at which the relevant contract is signed. These spaces are usually sold at a discount
compared to the market value and allow the purchaser to use the parking space for the remaining
duration of our concession agreement. The purchaser of the parking space is required to pay us a
periodic fee for maintenance.

In addition to retaining our existing concessions once their initial term has expired, we also seek to
obtain new concessions and win renewals from our competitors. For new projects, we engage a third
party construction company under a competitive bidding process to build the parking facility. The total
expansionary capital expenditure for the period from 2014 to 2016 was approximately €57.6 million,
as a result of the consolidation effort made during this period, focusing on M&A activity and
acquisition of long term concessions. As of June 30, 2017, we had approximately €33.8 million in
outstanding capital commitments for constructing new car parks relating to concessions already
awarded in Lisbon, of which we expect to invest approximately €1.4 million in the second half of
2017.

The following chart shows the geographic distribution of our off-street concessions in Iberia and
Turkey.


-----

**On-street concessions**
Our on-street concession business is our second largest business line, representing 14.2% of
Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended June 30, 2017 and having a Weighted Average
Remaining Duration of approximately six years. As of June 30, 2017, we operated 123 on-street
concessions (including nine tow-away contracts) consisting of approximately 267,000 parking spaces
with 104 municipalities, including practically all major Spanish and Portuguese cities. We have been a
concessionaire in a number of cities, including Madrid, Valencia and Porto, since the introduction of
controlled on-street parking and thus have a successful longstanding relationship with many
municipalities.

Under our on-street concessions, we primarily manage on-street meter-controlled parking spaces for
municipalities. Depending on the needs of the client and the terms of the concession, we provide a
variety of additional services, which can include: collecting revenue from meters; maintaining ticket
dispensing machines; monitoring parking ordinances (including ticketing or wheel clamping); and
managing complaints and appeals. Under some of our on-street concessions, we also provide vehicle
removal services. We are not responsible for the enforcement of fines and our remuneration is not
linked to enforcement.

On-street concessions are typically awarded through public tenders. Under the terms of the
concession, we are generally required to make an initial investment which can consist of a lump-sum
payment to the municipality, and for the acquisition and installment of the on-street parking control
equipment, such as parking meters and other devices related to the monitoring of the parking meters.
In exchange, we typically receive fixed fees that are inflation-indexed and which cover the yearly
amortized amount of our initial investment and operating costs. In a number of concessions, besides
the fixed fee, the contract also includes a variable incentive element (which may be based on a
percentage of the collected meter receipts, the number of parking spaces or certain other qualitative
criteria) to align the concessionaire’s objectives with optimizing revenue collection. We believe that
there is low demand risk in most of these contracts since the bulk of our remuneration is fixed and
our base fee is typically not dependent on the amount of money collected. Even for those on-street
concessions under which our remuneration is dependent on collected revenues, we believe our
exposure to demand risk is relatively low, as the demand for on-street spaces tends to be greater
than the limited supply of on-street parking spaces, even during periods of relatively low demand.

Under a majority of our on-street concessions, the municipality receives the parking revenues
generated by those concessions and remits the relevant concession fee to us. As a result, we are
exposed to the credit risk of the applicable municipalities with respect to these concessions.

We operate our on-street concessions with our own employees. The operation of on-street
concessions is more labor intensive than our off-street concession operations. To efficiently manage
the area covered by our on-street concessions and to lower labor costs, we have introduced a
number of technological innovations such as electronic payments and license plate recognition
systems.

Our on-street concession contracts are usually for an initial term of approximately five to fifteen years,
and some agreements include extensions for an additional period under the same contractual terms.
Recently, municipalities have increased the duration for certain on-street concessions put to a tender
process in exchange for higher initial fee payments payable by the concessionaire. For example, we
have an on-street concession with a term of 20 years in Huelva, one with a term of 15 years in
Huesca and another one with a term of 12 years in Porto, which commenced in 2016. Upon
expiration of an on-street concession, we are usually obliged to transfer to the municipality the
ownership of the assets allocated to the operation of the concession, such as parking meters,
signage, towing equipment or other vehicles. Likewise, in connection with the transfer of a
concession at the end of its term, any of our employees assigned to that concession will be
transferred to the new operator, which will, by operation of law, be subrogated to our position as
employer in respect of such transferred employees. The same will apply when we win or acquire a
concession previously operated by one of our competitors.


-----

The following table sets forth the number of on-street concessions in Spain and Portugal we have
renewed and won from our competitors and the number of new contracts awarded to us, in each
case compared to the number of bids we submitted in each of the foregoing categories.

**Total since**

**On-street concessions** **2014**

**Renewals**

Awarded ...............................................................................................................                7

**% of success..........................................................................................................               29**

As shown above, since the beginning of 2014 we have renewed approximately 71% of the on-street
contracts that were already managed by us. We also won approximately 29% of the new on-street
contracts that were tendered and approximately 24% of the expiring on-street contracts for which we
submitted bids and that were previously operated by our competitors. We believe we have been able
to achieve these outcomes mainly as a result of the high barriers to entry in the business, the limited
number of major participants in the business, our technical competence and our ability to offer more
competitive terms than our competitors due to our ability to realize significant synergies from our
overall operations.

**Off-Street Contract Management**
Our off-street contract management business is our smallest business line, and represented 16.0% of
Adjusted Revenue in the twelve months ended June 30, 2017. As of June 30, 2017, we managed
over 132,000 parking spaces in Spain, Portugal and the United Kingdom (our total net turnover from
the United Kingdom was €21.3 million, or 10.3%, of total net turnover for the twelve months ended
June 30, 2017 in respect of our off-street contract management business), primarily at airports,
including those serving Madrid, Lisbon, London (London City Airport and Gatwick), Edinburgh, Porto
and Santiago de Compostela. This business line also generates a small amount of net turnover


-----

derived from providing operational and administrative assistance to other third parties in respect of
their concessions.

Our off-street management contracts are generally for shorter terms than our concession
arrangements, generally ranging from three to ten years. Our off-street management contracts
generally generate lower Adjusted EBITDA Margins compared to our off-street concessions. However,
these contracts require minimal investment and are not subject to significant demand risk. We
manage 18 airports in Spain with AENA, the Spanish public airport operator, and three in Portugal
with ANA, the Portuguese public airport operator which are also two of our main clients in Iberia with
respect to our off-street contract management business. We also manage park-and-ride car parks as
well as parking facilities for the London City Airport, Gatwick and Edinburgh airports. In addition to our
airport clients, our off-street management contracts include five hospitals operating in the United
Kingdom.

Under our off-street management contracts, we operate parking facilities for both public and private
clients in exchange for a fixed fee, which is generally inflation-indexed. In some limited cases, the
contracts also include a variable incentive fee element based on the amount of revenue generated
and certain other quality indicators. Thus we are not required to make an up-front payment to
manage the facilities or to make significant investments in the parking infrastructure. We typically
operate the parking facility with our own employees. We also utilize the expertise and technology
from our off-street concession operations in the management of these contracts.

The legislation governing off-street and on-street concessions is not applicable to our off-street
management contracts, so there is no ability to apply for economic rebalancing in these contracts.

contracts.

**Rebalancing Provisions in Off-street and On-street Concessions**
Our off-street and on-street concessions in Spain and Portugal are primarily governed by
administrative laws similar to the laws that regulate highway and road infrastructure concessions in
Spain and Portugal. These concessions typically include a rebalancing clause which provides that, in
certain cases, if the fundamental economic balance that existed when the contract was awarded has
changed to the disadvantage of the concessionaire, the concessionaire can demand fair
compensation from the public authority that granted the concession. See “Regulation—Spain—
_Restoring of the economic balance” and “—Portugal—Economic-Financial Balance”._

The changes that can give rise to a claim for compensation include the adoption of administrative
measures or other non-contractual and extraordinary causes that were unforeseen at the time the
contract was made, which affect the long-term economic benefit of the contract in a material way to
the detriment of the concessionaire. For example, a permanent road closure that adversely impacts
the flow of traffic with respect to the location of the concession may trigger a rebalancing of the
concession terms. The compensation granted by the public authority can include, depending on the


-----

circumstances, an extension of the concession term (subject to the maximum legal term) or an
increase in the tariffs chargeable to customers or paid by the contracting authorities (for on-street
concessions, when applicable). If applicable, the public authority may grant additional parking spaces
under the existing concession or another change of the economic terms of the concession contract
between the municipality and us. The application of the rebalancing clause is not an automatic
procedure and the compensation granted will vary on a case by case basis.

We have obtained such adjustments to our concessions and contracts on a number of occasions. In
Portugal, for example, an amendment was agreed and executed with the municipality of Faro in
relation to a concession contract for on-street parking. Under this agreement, the terms and
conditions of the initial contract were modified to compensate for the tariff modifications imposed by
the awarding entity. Other concession modifications include an extension of our Madrid concessions
and an increase in tariffs as a result of a regulatory change in 1997 requiring that concessionaires
invest in order to comply with new parameters, tariff increases in multiple locations as a result of a
2006 change in parking rate calculations from hours to minutes, and the granting of new parking
spots in Pozuelo, Majadhonda and Valladolid in 2010 following the closure of certain streets to traffic.

**New Concessions and Investments**
Since 2014, we have completed the construction of several large off-street parking facilities, including
Infante Santo in Lisbon. In 2015, we acquired EMSA and commenced operations at Gatwick. In 2016,
we commenced operations under three new concessions in Istanbul as well as the on-street
management contract in Porto. Most recently, in April 2017, we won a contract to operate in France.
The revenue and Adjusted EBITDA generated by new parking facilities gradually ramp up over the
first three to four years after they become operational, and then typically remain fairly stable with
moderate increases due to inflation adjustments and volume increases (largely reflecting increased
demand due to increased traffic in cities) for the remaining term of the concession.

We have a well-established and disciplined process for evaluating potential new concessions and
other investment opportunities. We maintain an investment committee comprising members of our
senior management team that reviews and evaluates all concession tenders where we consider
submitting a bid. When evaluating a potential opportunity, the committee considers targeted
investment returns, the proposed financial models, expected consumer demand for the parking
facility, potential risks and possible economies of scale with existing concession investments. Our
investment committee supervises our business development department, which is dedicated to the
preparation of studies, project design and bid documentation for tenders for new concessions and the
evaluation of potential acquisitions of existing concessions and concession operators. Our business
development department works closely with our regional business units in the evaluation process. We
believe that this dedicated approach allows us to evaluate and respond in a timely and efficient
manner to potential business opportunities.

All projects are submitted to risk assessment by our risk department which issues a report on every
project, wherein it may ask for clarifications or changes to a proposal submitted by business
development. Financial models submitted as part of this process must follow standard rules and
formats, and all project proposals must include security margins, sensibility analyses, benchmarking
and an analysis of expected competition. The investment committee may reject, approve or approve
the project with changes. Projects with an accumulated investment of greater than €5 million in value
must be approved by our board of directors, but those of less than €5 million may be approved by the
executive committee. Approved investments are subject to a subsequent monthly monitoring followup plan that can last over three years.

In general, the tender process for a new concession requires the preparation and submission of three
categories of documentation: documentation demonstrating that the bidder meets the legal and
technical requirements to participate in the tender; documentation outlining the proposed economic
terms of the bid, including fees payable to the public authority and the tariffs charged to end users;
and the technical specifications for the development and operation of the parking infrastructure.

Generally, bids for off-street concessions and off-street management contracts are the most
competitive, focusing primarily on price and other economic terms. Bids for on-street concessions
tend to be less competitive, as there are often a limited number of potential operators, and they tend
to focus on the technical specifications of the concession and the demonstrated experience of the


-----

bidder. Once the term of the contract expires (including the possible extensions, which cannot go
beyond the maximum term provided by law for such concessions), it cannot be renewed without a
prior public tender process. For off-street contract management, each entity awarding the contract
may have its own awarding process and selection criteria, but it will generally be required to follow
public bidding rules.

**Joint Ventures**
For some of our concessions we have entered into joint venture arrangements (including special
purpose companies and temporary consortiums) with local minority partners for the purpose of
satisfying certain specific tender requirements or to take advantage of local market experience and
knowledge. We typically do this through “ring-fenced” non-recourse financing arrangements. As of
June 30, 2017, we operated several majority held joint ventures, and also held minority interests in
joint ventures where the local municipality requires that it holds a majority stake in the
concessionaire.

Set forth below are certain entities in which we held an ownership interest of 50% or less as of June
30, 2017:

**Property**
We lease our main corporate offices in Madrid and Lisbon. We also lease regional offices in Spain
and maintain offices in the United Kingdom, Andorra, Turkey and France.

As described in “Regulation”, upon the expiration of the term of the concession, unless the
concession is renewed, the parking infrastructure reverts to the public authority that granted the
concession.

**Suppliers**
Historically, our primary suppliers have been construction companies and contractors who build our
off-street parking facilities. We also rely on suppliers of parking meter equipment and information
technology. For parking meter equipment, we fulfill our requirements from a limited number of
international suppliers. For information technology, we purchase from a variety of suppliers.


-----

Additionally, we outsource part of our information technology needs and certain other limited services,
including operating shuttle buses to and from our parking lots at airports. We are not dependent on
any single supplier.

**Clients**
We have two groups of clients. The first group comprises the parties with which we enter into
concessions or off-street contract management arrangements. The second group comprises the end
users or customers.

Our client base with whom we enter into on-street concessions or off-street contract management
agreements includes municipalities, semi-public entities and private companies. As of June 30, 2017,
we had 298 off-street concessions with 84 municipalities, 123 on-street concessions with 104
municipalities and 11 off-street management contracts with customers such as AENA and ANA. We
manage our relationships with these clients on a centralized, regional and local basis. In general, the
same personnel that manage our contracts on an ongoing basis are responsible for maintaining
relationships with our clients. A number of our off-street and on-street concessions are managed by
personnel who have developed long-standing relationships with the municipalities and private entities
with whom we enter into concession management agreements. For the twelve months ended June
30, 2017, our top 10 off-street contracts represented approximately 12.3% of total gross profit. The
following chart sets out our top ten customer contracts by gross profit for the twelve months ended
June 30, 2017.

The second group of clients we have are the end users that utilize the car parks that we operate. We
are focused on providing end users with a car park service that is high quality, easy to use, safe and
efficient. We concentrate on the image of our car parks by ensuring that our car parks are up to date,
safe and convenient places for end users.

**Information Technology**
We believe that automation and technology can enhance customer convenience, lower labor costs,
improve cash management and increase overall profitability. As a result we have for more than 15
years invested in our in-house IT platform, which monitors staff, revenues and maintenance control.
We have introduced a number of automation and technology based services to the car park industry
in recent years, including a license plate reading operation system, and have developed a proprietary
set of in-house information technology applications to optimize the utilization of internal resources and
increase the quality of the services provided. In our off-street concessions, we have centralized
management which is controlled remotely from a single 24-hour hub. As of June 30, 2017,
approximately 80% of our off-street car parks were equipped with these systems.


-----

**Employees**
As of June 30, 2017, we employed 2,670 individuals. As of December 31, 2016, we employed
approximately 2,600 individuals. Most of our employees in Spain are represented by a number of
different labor unions.

We believe that our relations with employees are satisfactory. We have occasionally experienced
strikes and work stoppages. However, such strikes and work stoppages have historically not had a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

**Insurance**
We purchase comprehensive liability insurance covering certain claims that can occur at the parking
facilities that we operate. As is customary, these policies have deductibles that must be paid before
the insurance companies are required to reimburse us for costs and liabilities relating to covered
claims. We also have directors and officers insurance as well as life and personal insurance for our
employees. We believe that our insurance coverage, including the maximum coverage amounts and
terms and conditions of the insurance policies, are both standard for our industry and appropriate. We
cannot, however, guarantee that we will not incur any losses or be the subject of claims that exceed
the scope of the relevant insurance coverage.

**Competition**
We face competition from other parking operators in the bidding process for off-street and on-street
concessions and contracts. We also face this competition when our concessions and contracts come
up for renewal and when we bid on concessions of others which are coming up for renewal. As one
of the leading concessionaires of off-street and on-street parking in Iberia and due to our longstanding relationships with a diverse number of local authorities, we believe that we are well
positioned compared to our competitors. Since the Weighted average remaining duration of our offstreet concessions and contracts was approximately 25 years as of June 30, 2017, we face limited
competition in the near future to maintain our off-street portfolio. Generally, the competition to obtain
off-street concessions is more intense than for on-street concessions. Additionally, there are several
barriers to entry to obtain new concessions, in particular for on-street concessions. These barriers to
entry include having the relevant administrative qualifications, relevant experience and technology.

Our parking facilities face competition for end users with nearby parking options. In general, we
believe end users are not willing to park more than a short walk from their intended destination so
competition is generally based on location and proximity to a customer’s intended location. However,
we may face competition from parking structures built nearby. We believe this competition is normally
limited since many of our off-street parking facilities have limited direct competition within easy
walking distance and the risk of new structures being built is mitigated by the cost and difficulty of
developing new parking facilities in city centers due to the high density and planning regulations. For
our on-street concessions, the terms of the concessions provide us with exclusivity within the areas
covered by the relevant concession, subject to parking allocated to local residents.

**Legal Proceedings**
We are party to various legal proceedings involving routine claims that are incidental to our business.
See “Risk Factors—Risk relating to Our Business Industry—Instances of fraud, bribery and
_corruption involving our management, employees, business partners or agents could expose us to_
_penalties and reputational damage and could hinder our ability to acquire or renew concessions or_
_even continue our operating activities” and “Risk Factors—Risk Relating to Our Business Industry—_
_We are subject to changes in tax laws, tax rates and their application and interpretation in the_
_markets in which we operate, and we have been (and may continue to be) subject to significant_
_claims related to tax disputes and audits”. Although our legal and financial liability with respect to_
such proceedings cannot be estimated with certainty, we do not believe that the outcome of these
legal proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition or results of operations.

# Related Party Transactions

We have in the past from time to time entered into transactions with certain of our officers, directors
and shareholders and other entities in which certain of our officers, directors and shareholders hold
ownership interests. These transactions include, among others, financing arrangements, shareholder
arrangements and commercial arrangements. We also have in the past entered into transactions with
entities that may be deemed to be affiliates because the Group holds a minority stake in such
entities. The following discussion is a brief summary of certain of the significant arrangements,
agreements and transactions we have with such related parties.

**Proceeds Loans**
In connection with the Acquisition, on or about the Completion Date, the Issuer will on-lend the net
proceeds from the Offering of the Notes to Bidco by way of the Proceeds Loans. The proceeds from
the proceeds loans will be applied as described in “The Transactions”.

**Other Related Party Transactions**
In the ordinary course of business, we may enter into transactions with portfolio companies or
affiliates of MIRA and the Macquarie Group. We do not consider these transactions to be material to
us, either individually or in the aggregate.

# Description of Certain Financing Arrangements

_The following is a summary of the material terms of our principal financing arrangements in addition_
_to the Indenture after giving effect to the Transactions. The following summaries do not purport to_
_describe all of the applicable terms and conditions of such arrangements and are qualified in their_
_entirety by reference to the actual agreements. Capitalized terms used in the following summaries_
_and not otherwise defined in this offering memorandum have the meanings ascribed to them in their_
_respective agreements._

**New Revolving Credit Facility**
The Group expects to enter into a revolving credit facility (the “New Revolving Credit Facility
_Agreement” and the facility thereunder the “New Revolving Credit Facility”) on or prior to the Issue_
Date with, among others, Banco Santander S.A., BNP Paribas Fortis SA/NV, J.P. Morgan Securities
plc and National Westminster Bank plc, as mandated lead arrangers. The New Revolving Credit
Facility will have a total commitment of €75 million and will mature six years after the Issue Date, or if
earlier, six months prior to the maturity date of the Notes. Borrowings under the New Revolving Credit
Facility will be available to fund, among other things, the Group’s general corporate and working
capital purposes (including acquisitions, capital expenditures and investments) but will not be able to
be drawn for the purpose of paying principal or interest under the Acquisition and Fees Proceed Loan
and may be drawn in euros. The New Revolving Credit Facility will initially be made available to Bidco
as the original borrower.

**_Repayments and prepayments_**
Repayments of loans drawn under the New Revolving Credit Facility and related interest payments
will be due and payable at the end of the interest period for each loan. The applicable interest period
is selected in the relevant utilization request and will either be one, two, three or six months. There is
no clean down requirement.

If it becomes unlawful in any jurisdiction for a lender to perform its obligations under the New
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (or becomes unlawful for any affiliate of a lender for that lender
to do so) such lender under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will have the right to cancel
its commitments. Each borrower under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement shall repay the
relevant lender’s participation in any utilisations made to that borrower on the last day of the interest
period after Bidco has been notified or if earlier, the date specified by the relevant lender (being no
earlier than the last day of any applicable grace period).

On a change of control or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Group (pursuant to the
terms of the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement), the lenders may request, by not less than ten
business days’ notice to Bidco, cancellation of its commitments and may declare all outstanding
amounts owed to it due and payable provided that such request is made within 30 days of the
occurrence of the applicable event. The New Revolving Credit Facility will not be portable.

Additionally, if any member of Group repays, prepays, purchases, defeases, redeems, acquires or
retires (the “Notes Repurchase”) any Notes and certain other replacement debt (“Notes Repurchase
_Debt”) other than to the extent funded with new equity or subordinated shareholder debt, the_
proceeds of any listing, any permitted refinancing or amounts which would otherwise be permitted to
be returned to investors and, as a result of such Notes Repurchase (the “Specified Notes
_Repurchase”) when taken together with any other Notes Repurchase previously effected or which will_
be effected on the same date as such Specified Notes Repurchase, the aggregate principal amount
of the Notes Repurchase Debt outstanding immediately following such Specified Notes Repurchase
is not in excess of or equal to 50% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes Repurchase Debt
as at the Completion Date (the “Prepayment Threshold”), commitments are required to be cancelled
and outstanding loans prepaid in an amount equal to the proportion that the amount by which the
Prepayment Threshold exceeds the principal amount of the Notes Repurchase Debt immediately
following such Specified Notes Repurchase bears to the amount of the Prepayment Threshold.


-----

**_Interest_**
Loans under the New Revolving Credit Facility will bear interest at a rate equal to the aggregate of
EURIBOR (subject to a zero per cent floor) and a margin of 1.90% per annum.

**_Incremental facilities_**
The New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contemplates, subject to certain conditions thereof, the
incurrence of additional incremental uncommitted revolving facilities (“Incremental Facilities”) in a
maximum aggregate amount not to exceed (after taking account of the commitments under the New
Revolving Credit Facility and any prior Incremental Facilities) the amount able to be incurred under
clause (1) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “Description of Notes—Certain
_Covenants—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock”. Such Incremental_
Facilities will be secured and guaranteed on a pari passu basis with the New Revolving Credit Facility
and rank pari passu in right of payment and security with the New Revolving Credit Facility (including
with respect to mandatory prepayments).

The availability, maturity, pricing and other terms of any Incremental Facility will be those agreed
between Bidco and the relevant lenders of that Incremental Facility, provided that (i) from the signing
date of the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement up to and including the date falling 12 months
after the Completion Date the margin for any Incremental Facility shall be no more than the margin
on the Completion Date for the New Revolving Credit Facility plus 2.00% per annum (the “MFN
_Rate”), unless the margin for the New Revolving Credit Facility is increased by an amount equal to_
the amount by which the margin for such Incremental Facility exceeds the MFN Rate; and (ii) no
Incremental Facility may have a maturity date that is earlier than the maturity date of the New
Revolving Credit Facility.

**_Guarantees and security_**
The New Revolving Credit Facility will be (subject to certain Agreed Security Principles set forth in the
New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) guaranteed by the Guarantors and secured on a pari passu
basis by the same collateral that secures the Notes as further described in the section entitled
“Description of Notes—Security”.

The New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement requires that (subject to Agreed Security Principles and
within 90 days of the Completion Date) each member of the Group that is a Material Company (which
definition includes, among other things, any member of the Group that has earnings before interest,
tax, depreciation and amortization representing 5% or more (calculated on an unconsolidated basis
and excluding all intra-group items and without double counting) of Consolidated EBITDA or gross
assets representing 5% or more and excluding all intra-group items and without double counting of
the consolidated gross assets of the Group or certain members of the Group that are the direct
holding companies of borrowers or guarantors) will be required to become a guarantor under the New
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.

Furthermore, Bidco is required to ensure the Guarantor Coverage Test is complied with within 90
days following the Completion Date and thereafter, if on the last day of each financial year
(commencing with the financial year ending December 2018) of Bidco and, subject to the Agreed
Security Principles, the guarantors represent less than 80% (calculated on an unconsolidated basis
and excluding all intra-group items and without double counting) of the Consolidated EBITDA and
consolidated gross assets of the Group excluding any Non-Recourse Entities and subject to certain
exceptions) (the “Guarantor Coverage Test”), within 90 days of delivery of the annual financial
statements for the relevant financial year, such other subsidiaries of Bidco (subject to Agreed Security
Principles and certain other exceptions) are required to become guarantors until the Guarantor
Coverage Test is satisfied (to be calculated as if such additional guarantors had been guarantors on
the last day of the relevant financial year).

**_Representations and warranties_**
The New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains certain customary representations and
warranties, subject to certain customary materiality, actual knowledge and other qualifications and
exceptions, and with certain representations and warranties being repeated, including, among others:
(i) status; (ii) power and authority; (iii) binding obligations; (iv) no conflict; (v) validity and admissibility
in evidence; (vi) choice of law and enforcement; (vii) insolvency; (vii) no filing or stamp taxes; (ix) no

**_Covenants_**
The New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains certain of the same incurrence covenants and
related definitions (with certain adjustments) that apply to the Notes, including with respect to
restricted payments. In addition, the New Revolving Credit Facility also contains certain affirmative
and negative covenants. Set forth below is a brief description of such covenants, all of which are
subject to customary materiality, actual knowledge or other qualifications, exceptions and baskets.

**_Affirmative covenants_**
The affirmative covenants include, among others: (i) providing certain financial information, including
annual audited and quarterly financial statements and compliance certificates; (ii) authorizations, (iii)
compliance with laws; (iv) pari passu ranking; (v) holding company; (vi) pensions; (vii) intellectual
property; (viii) guarantor coverage and security; (ix) anti-corruption; (x) further assurance; (xi) no
change of COMI; and (xii) conforming changes to the Senior Secured Notes. In addition, Bidco must
procure that certain actions are taken following the Completion Date, including the release of certain
security and guarantees, and repayment of certain existing debt.

**_Negative covenants_**
The negative covenants in the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement are substantially the same
as the negative covenants in the Indenture.

**_Financial covenant_**
The New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains a springing total net leverage covenant of
12.00:1, tested quarterly on a last-twelve month basis, if cash utilizations under the New Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement (including cash drawings under ancillary facilities and letters of credit drawn
to support cash drawings under third party facilities) exceed 40% of the total commitments under the
New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement on the applicable quarter date.

**_Events of default_**
The New Revolving Credit Facility provides for some of the same events of default (including in
relation to insolvency), with certain adjustments, as the Indenture. In addition, the New Revolving
Credit Facility will contain certain standard events of default, the occurrence of which would allow a
majority of the lenders to cancel commitments, accelerate all outstanding loans, accrued interest and
other amounts and declare them immediately due and payable and to enforce the lenders’ rights
under the New Revolving Credit Facility and certain other related documents. Certain of these events
of default also apply to Holdco as a third party security provider. These events of default include,
among other events and subject in certain cases to materiality, grace periods, thresholds and/or other
qualifications: (i) non-payment of amounts due under the applicable finance documents; (ii) failure to
satisfy covenants, undertakings and other obligations under the applicable finance documents; (iii)
inaccuracy of a representation or statement when made or deemed to be made; (iv) breach of
financial covenant (subject to certain equity cure rights); (v) unlawfulness and invalidity of any
member of the Group, (vi) material obligations of members of the Group under the applicable finance
documents are not or cease to be legal, valid, binding and enforceable; (vii) failure of any party (other
than a secured party) to comply with its obligations under the Intercreditor Agreement (as defined
below); and (viii) repudiation or rescission of any applicable finance document or any transaction
security.

**_Governing law_**
The New Revolving Credit Facility will be governed by English law provided that the covenants and
events of default following the equivalent covenants and events of default in the Indenture shall be
interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.


-----

**Intercreditor Agreement**
To establish the relative rights of certain of the Group’s creditors under the Group’s financing
arrangements, the Issuer, the Guarantors, and any obligor in respect of the New Revolving Credit
Facility, any Other Credit Facility Debt, any Future Pari passu Debt and any Future Senior
Subordinated Debt (each as defined below) (collectively, the “Debtors”), third party chargors
(collectively, the “Third Party Chargors”), the lenders under the New Revolving Credit Facility, The
Royal Bank of Scotland plc as agent for the New Revolving Credit Facility (the “Senior Agent”), The
Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch as security agent for the New Revolving Credit Facility and
the Notes and certain hedging arrangements (the “Security Agent”), and the Trustee, among others,
will enter into an intercreditor agreement (the “Intercreditor Agreement”), to govern the relationships
and relative priorities among: (i) the lenders under the New Revolving Credit Facility and any Other
Credit Facility Debt which is permitted under the terms of the New Revolving Credit Facility, certain
Other Credit Facility Debt, the Notes and Future Pari passu Debt to share in the proceeds of
enforcement of Security on a super senior basis to the Notes; (ii) the holders of senior secured notes
that may be issued from time to time, including the Notes, and those party to any indentures or other
documents governing such senior secured notes; (iii) the lenders or other creditors under any other
loan, credit or debt facility, notes, indentures or other debt instrument which are permitted under the
terms of the New Revolving Credit Facility, certain Other Credit Facility Debt and the Notes to share
in the Security on a pari passu basis with the Notes; (iv) the hedge counterparties to the Group’s
hedging arrangements (each a “Hedging Bank”); (v) the lenders or other creditors under any loan,
credit or debt facility, notes, indentures or other debt instrument which are permitted under the terms
of the New Revolving Credit Facility, certain Other Credit Facility Debt and the Notes to share in the
Security on a senior subordinated basis to the Notes; and (vi) the creditors of certain subordinated
shareholder debt and certain intragroup debt. The lenders, holders, hedge counterparties and other
creditors referred to in (i) to (iv) above being the “Priority Creditors” and the indebtedness owing to
those Priority Creditors under the documents referred to in (i) to (iv) above, being the “Priority Debt”
and the lenders, holders, hedge counterparties and other creditors referred to in (ii) to (v) (inclusive)
(in the case of (iv), only to the extent such hedging arrangements (x) do not constitute Super Senior
Hedging Liabilities (as defined below) or, (y) following the full and final discharge of all Super Senior
Lending Liabilities (as defined below), are being taken into account for the purpose of determining the
relevant creditor instructing group (as detailed in “Security Enforcement” below)) being the “Senior
_Secured Creditors”._

**_General_**
By accepting a Note, the holder thereof will be deemed to have agreed to, and accepted the terms
and conditions of, the Intercreditor Agreement. The following description is a summary of certain
provisions, among others, contained in the Intercreditor Agreement that relate to the rights and
obligations of the holders of the Notes and the other creditors party thereto. It does not restate the
Intercreditor Agreement in its entirety nor does it describe provisions relating to all classes of debt. As
such, you are urged to read the Intercreditor Agreement because it, and not the discussion that
follows, defines certain rights of the holders of the Notes and certain other creditors. In this
discussion, capitalized terms have the meaning given to them in the Intercreditor Agreement unless
the contrary is otherwise stated or the context otherwise requires.

**_Ranking and priority_**
The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Group’s liabilities under the Group’s indebtedness shall
rank in right and priority of payment in the following order:

-    first, liabilities under and in respect of (i) the New Revolving Credit Facility (the “RCF
_Liabilities”); (ii) any other super senior credit facility or super senior hedging (the “Other Credit_
_Facility Liabilities” or the “Other Credit Facility Debt” and together with the RCF Liabilities, the_
“Super Senior Lending Liabilities”); (iii) the Group’s senior secured notes (including the Notes)
(the “Senior Secured Notes Liabilities” or the “Senior Secured Notes”); (iv) any pari passu loan,
credit or debt facility, notes, indentures or other debt instrument (the “Future Pari passu
_Liabilities” or the “Future Pari passu Debt”); (v) hedging arrangements (the “Hedging_
_Liabilities”); (vi) amounts owing to the Trustee (the “Trustee Liabilities”); and (vii) amounts_
owing to the Security Agent pari passu without any preference among them (collectively, the
“Priority Liabilities”);


-----

-    second, liabilities under and in respect of any senior subordinated loan, credit or debt facility,
notes, indentures or other debt instrument, including any guarantee provided by a member of
the Group with respect to any notes of an issuer that is not a member of the Group and the
proceeds of which are down-streamed to a member of the Group (“Future Senior Subordinated
_Liabilities” or “Future Senior Subordinated Debt” and together with the Priority Liabilities, the_
“Secured Debt”);

-    third, liabilities under and in respect of certain intragroup debt (the “Intra-Group Liabilities”); and

-    fourth, liabilities under and in respect of certain shareholder debt (the “Shareholder Liabilities”).

The Intercreditor Agreement permits any obligor party to a hedging agreement and the relevant
hedge counterparty to agree that any amount (subject to a cap) of the Hedging Liabilities incurred
under that hedging agreement will be treated on a super senior basis upon the distribution of
proceeds arising from the enforcement of any Transaction Security, as defined below, (the “Super
_Senior Hedging Liabilities” and together with the Super Senior Lending Liabilities, the “Super Senior_
_Liabilities”)._

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that Transaction Security created pursuant to the Transaction
Security Documents (as defined below) will rank and secure (to the extent Transaction Security is
expressed to secure such liabilities):

-    first, the Priority Liabilities pari passu and without any preference between them; and

-    second, the Future Senior Subordinated Liabilities pari passu and without any preference
between them.

The Intra-Group Liabilities and the Shareholder Liabilities are and will remain unguaranteed and
unsecured.

**_Permitted payments_**
The Intercreditor Agreement provides that prior to a Secured Acceleration Event that is continuing (as
defined below), the members of the Group and Third Party Chargors, as applicable, may make
payments in relation to the Super Senior Lending Liabilities, the Senior Secured Notes Liabilities and
any Future Pari passu Liabilities, in each case in accordance with their respective governing
documents and subject to, in the case of payments of the Senior Secured Notes Liabilities in
accordance with the New Revolving Credit Facility and in the case of payments of Future Pari passu
Liabilities, any restrictions contained in the documents governing the Super Senior Lending Liabilities
and the Senior Secured Notes Liabilities. Following the occurrence of an acceleration event with
respect to the Super Senior Lending Liabilities, the Senior Secured Notes Liabilities or the Future Pari
_passu Liabilities (a “Secured Acceleration Event” and together with the occurrence of an acceleration_
event with respect to the Future Senior Subordinated Liabilities, an “Acceleration Event”), no Debtor,
Third Party Chargor or any member of the Group may, subject to certain exceptions, make any
payment in respect of Super Senior Lending Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes Liabilities or Future
_Pari passu Liabilities except from enforcement proceeds or recoveries distributed in accordance with_
the payment waterfall described in “—Application of Amounts Recovered” below. The restriction in the
foregoing sentence shall not apply where: (a) the Majority Super Senior Creditors and the Majority
Senior Secured Creditors agree otherwise or (b) the relevant distribution or dividend is out of any
Debtor or Third Party Chargor’s unsecured assets (pro rata to each unsecured creditor’s claim) and
made by a liquidator, receiver, administrative receiver, administrator, compulsory manager or other
similar officer appointed in respect of any Debtor or Third Party Chargor or any of its assets.

Prior to a Secured Acceleration Event members of the Group and Third Party Chargors may make
payments in respect of the Hedging Liabilities, as agreed under the governing documents of those
arrangements so long as those payments are not otherwise prohibited by the Intercreditor Agreement.
Following the occurrence of a Secured Acceleration Event no Third Party Chargor, Debtor or any
member of the Group may, subject to certain exceptions, make any payment in respect of Hedging
Liabilities except from enforcement proceeds or recoveries distributed in accordance with the
payment waterfall described in “—Application of Amounts Recovered” below. The restriction in the
foregoing sentence shall not apply where: (a) the Majority Super Senior Creditors and the Majority
Senior Secured Creditors agree otherwise or (b) the relevant distribution or dividend is out of any


-----

Debtor or Third Party Chargor’s unsecured assets (pro rata to each unsecured creditor’s claim) and
made by a liquidator, receiver, administrative receiver, administrator, compulsory manager or other
similar officer appointed in respect of any Debtor or Third Party Chargor or any of its assets.

Members of the Group may make payments in respect of certain Intra-Group Liabilities, as agreed
under the governing documents of the relevant Intra-Group Liabilities, so long as no Secured
Acceleration Event has occurred and is continuing and those payments are not otherwise prohibited
by the Intercreditor Agreement.

Members of the Group may make payments in respect of certain Shareholder Liabilities, as agreed
under the governing documents of the relevant Shareholder Liabilities, so long as: (i) the payment is
not prohibited by the terms of any document governing the Super Senior Lending Liabilities, the
Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, the Future Pari passu Liabilities or the Future Senior Subordinated
Liabilities; or (ii) the relevant creditor instructing group at that time (or following the discharge of all
the Priority Debt, a majority of the Future Senior Subordinated Creditors) has given written consent to
the payment being made.

Prior to the discharge of all Priority Debt, neither the Issuer nor any Debtor or Third Party Chargor
may make payments in respect of the Future Senior Subordinated Debt Liabilities without the consent
of the Majority Super Senior Secured Creditors (as defined below) and Majority Senior Secured
Creditors (as defined below) except for the following:

1.    if:

(a)   the payment is of:

       -    any of the principal or capitalized interest of the Future Senior Subordinated
Liabilities which is either (1) not prohibited from being paid by the New Revolving
Credit Facility or any other super senior credit facility, the Indenture or any Future
_Pari passu Debt finance document or (2) is paid on or after the final maturity of the_
Future Senior Subordinated Liabilities (provided such maturity date is no earlier
than that contained in the relevant Future Senior Subordinated Debt Documents
as of the first day of incurrence of any Future Senior Subordinated Debt); or

       -    any other amount which is not an amount of principal or capitalized interest and
default interest on the Future Senior Subordinated Liabilities accrued due and
payable in cash in accordance with the terms of the relevant debt documents for
the Future Senior Subordinated Debt, additional amounts payable as a result of
the tax gross up provisions relating to the Future Senior Subordinated Debt
Liabilities or amounts in respect of currency indemnities in the relevant debt
documents for the Future Senior Subordinated Debt;

(b)   no notice delivered pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement blocking
payments in respect of the Future Senior Subordinated Debt Liabilities (a “Payment
_Blockage Notice”) is outstanding; and_

(c)   no payment default under the New Revolving Credit Facility and no payment default of
€100,000 or more in respect of the Senior Secured Notes Liabilities or Future Pari passu
Liabilities is continuing (a “Senior Payment Default”);

provided that no payment of principal may be made in respect of any proceeds loan
relating to any Future Senior Subordinated Liabilities pursuant to which amounts are
owed to an issuer of notes that is not a member of the Group, unless such payment is
made to facilitate the making of a payment by such notes issuer of an amount of such
notes that was previously down-streamed to a member of the Group, or

2.    costs, commissions, taxes, consent fees and expenses incurred in respect of (or reasonably
incidental to) the Future Senior Subordinated Debt documents (including in relation to any
reporting or listing requirements under the Future Senior Subordinated debt documents);

3.    costs, commissions, taxes, premiums and any expenses incurred in respect of (or reasonably
incidental to) any refinancing of the Future Senior Subordinated Debt in compliance with the


-----

Intercreditor Agreement, the New Revolving Credit Facility, the Indenture and any Future Pari
_passu Debt document;_

4.    in respect of any Future Senior Subordinated Debt issued in the form of notes, certain
customary costs and expenses payable to the Future Senior Subordinated Debt
Representative; or

5.    Trustee Liabilities.

Prior to the discharge of all the Priority Debt, if a Senior Payment Default has occurred and is
continuing, all payments in respect of the Future Senior Subordinated Debt Liabilities (other
than certain very limited exceptions) are suspended.

Prior to the discharge of all the Priority Debt, if an event of default (other than a Senior
Payment Default) under the finance documents in respect of the Priority Debt (a “Senior
_Default”) has occurred and is continuing and the Future Senior Subordinated Debt_
Representative (as defined below) has received a Payment Blockage Notice from the Senior
Agent, the Trustee or the representative of the Future Pari passu Debt representing Future Pari
_passu Debt (as the case may be) (the “Relevant Representative”) confirming that it is a Senior_
Default and specifying the relevant Senior Default; all payments in respect of the Future Senior
Subordinated Liabilities (other than those consented to by the Majority Super Senior Creditors
(as defined below) and Majority Senior Secured Creditors (as defined below) and certain
specified exceptions) are suspended until the earliest of:

(i)    the date on which there is a waiver, remedy or cure of such Senior Default in
accordance with the relevant finance documents;

(ii)   the date on which a default under the Future Senior Subordinated Debt occurs for failure
to pay principal at the original scheduled maturity of the Future Senior Subordinated
Debt;

(iii)   the first business day 179 days after the receipt by the Future Senior Subordinated Debt
Representative of the Payment Blockage Notice;

(iv)   the repayment and discharge of all obligations in respect of the Priority Debt;

(v)   the date on which the Relevant Representative which issued the Payment Blockage
Notice (and, if at such time an event of default is continuing in relation to the Priority
Debt (other than the debt in respect of which the notice was given), the Relevant
Representative(s) in respect of that other debt) notify/ies the Future Senior Subordinated
Debt Representative that the Payment Blockage Notice is cancelled;

(vi)   the date on which the Security Agent or Future Senior Subordinated Debt
Representative takes any Enforcement Action against a member of the Group which it is
permitted to take in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement;

(vii)  the date on which the relevant event of default is no longer continuing and if the Priority
Debt has been accelerated such acceleration has been rescinded (and if such
acceleration consisted solely of declaring the relevant debt payable on demand such
rescission can be effected by the relevant majority creditors in respect of the relevant
debt); or

(viii)  if a Standstill Period (as defined below) is in effect at any time after delivery, of a
Payment Blockage Notice, the date on which the Standstill Period expires.

No Payment Blockage Notice may be served by a Relevant Representative unless 365 days
have elapsed since the immediately prior Payment Blockage Notice. No Payment Blockage
Notice may be served in respect of a Senior Default more than 60 days after the date that the
Relevant Representative received notice of that Senior Default.

If a Payment Blockage Notice ceases to be outstanding or the relevant Senior Default or
Senior Payment Default has ceased to be continuing (by being waived by the relevant
creditors/creditor’s representative or remedied) the relevant Debtor or Third Party Chargor may


-----

then make those payments it would have otherwise been entitled to pay under the Future
Senior Subordinated Debt and if it does so promptly any event of default under the Future
Senior Subordinated Debt caused by such delayed payment shall be waived and any notice
commencing a Standstill Period which may have been issued as a result of such non-payment
shall be waived. A Senior Payment Default is remedied by the payment of all amounts then
due.

Following the discharge of all the Priority Debt, payments in respect of Future Senior
Subordinated Liabilities may be made in accordance with their terms.

**_Hedging_**
Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, persons entering into any hedging transaction with certain
members of the Group will be entitled to share in the Transaction Security provided that they are
have acceded to the Intercreditor Agreement as a hedge counterparty.

**_Non-security enforcement_**
No creditor of Shareholder Liabilities shall take any enforcement action until after the date on which
all Priority Liabilities and Future Senior Subordinated Liabilities have been fully discharged and there
is no obligation to provide further financial accommodation to any Debtor (the “Final Discharge Date”)
unless it is following the occurrence of an insolvency event in relation to any Debtor or a Third Party
Chargor and such enforcement action is permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement.

No creditor of Intra-Group Liabilities shall take any enforcement action (other than rights of set off to
enable permitted intra-group payments) prior to the Final Discharge Date unless it is following the
occurrence of an insolvency event in relation to any Debtor or Third Party Chargor and such
enforcement action is permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement.

With respect to Hedging Liabilities, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that a hedge counterparty
may, to the extent is able to under the relevant hedging agreement, terminate, reduce or close-out
hedging prior to its stated maturity if any of the following has occurred: (i) any of the Secured Debt
(other than the Hedging Liabilities and the Trustee Liabilities) has been accelerated or the
Transaction Security has been enforced; (ii) an illegality, tax event, tax event upon merger or force
_majeure event; (iii) occurrence of an insolvency event that is continuing in relation to any Debtor or_
Third Party Chargor that is party to a hedging agreement; (iv) a certain majority of other creditors of
the Priority Liabilities (other than the Hedging Liabilities) give their prior written consent; (v) if the
hedge counterparty and the relevant Debtor agree and no default is continuing under any document
governing the Secured Debt (other than the Hedging Liabilities); (vi) there is an interest rate or
exchange rate hedge excess; (vii) if the hedge counterparties cease to be secured under the
Transaction Security without their consent; or (viii) a payment default has been continuing under the
relevant hedging agreement for more than 14 days.

**_Security enforcement_**
The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the
Transaction Security unless the Security Agent receives enforcement instructions from the relevant
creditor instructing group. Any instructions provided by a relevant creditor instructing group must be in
accordance with the security enforcement principles provided in the Intercreditor Agreement.

Instructions in relation to the enforcement of the Transaction Security may be delivered to the
Security Agent by any of (i) the creditors representing in aggregate 66[2]⁄3% or more of the aggregate
super senior credit participations of the creditors of the Super Senior Liabilities (the “Majority Super
_Senior Creditors”), or (ii) the creditors representing more than 50% of (A) the aggregate senior_
secured credit participations of the creditors of the Senior Secured Notes Liabilities and the Future
_Pari passu Liabilities and (B) the aggregate senior secured credit participations of the creditors of the_
Hedging Liabilities that are not Super Senior Hedging Liabilities (the “Majority Senior Secured
_Creditors”). If the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors wish to_
instruct the Security Agent to commence enforcement of any Transaction Security, the creditor
representative(s) (each a “Creditor Representative”) of the relevant creditor instructing group shall
notify the Security Agent and the creditor representative of each other creditor of the Priority
Liabilities.


-----

Following delivery of proposed enforcement instructions, the Creditor Representatives of the Majority
Super Senior Creditors and the Majority Senior Secured Creditors will consult with each other in good
faith as to the manner of enforcement for a period of five business days with a view to coordinating
the instructions to be given by the relevant creditor instructing group and agreeing the strategy for
enforcement unless: (i) the Majority Super Senior Creditors and the Majority Senior Secured Creditors
otherwise agree; (ii) an insolvency event has occurred in relation to any Third Party Chargor, Debtor
or other member of the Group and the Transaction Security has become enforceable as a result; (iii)
one of the relevant Creditor Representatives determines in good faith that no consultation period or,
as the case may be, a shorter consultation period is necessary in order to avoid impairing the value
which would be realized on enforcement of the Transaction Security to an extent that would prevent
the discharge of the Super Senior Liabilities in full; or (iv) have a material adverse effect on the
Security Agent’s ability to enforce the Transaction Security (the “Consultation Period”). In
circumstances where (iv) applies, any instructions delivered by a Creditor Representative must be
limited to those necessary to protect or preserve the interests of the relevant creditor instructing
group on behalf of which it acts as a Creditor Representative and the Security Agent will act in
accordance with the instructions first received.

After the expiry of the Consultation Period:

-    If the Majority Super Senior Creditors and/or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors have
agreed on an enforcement strategy, the Security Agent shall be instructed to implement the
same.

-    If the Security Agent has received conflicting security enforcement instructions, the Security
Agent, subject to certain exceptions, will act on the instructions of the Majority Senior Secured
Creditors provided that those instructions are in accordance with the security enforcement
principles.

-    If the Security Agent is required to act on the instructions of the Majority Senior Secured
Creditors and Majority Super Senior Creditors and either (i) enforcement has not commenced
within three months of the end of the Consultation Period; (ii) the Super Senior Liabilities have
not been irrevocably repaid in full in cash within six months of the end of the Consultation
Period; or (iii) at any time (whether before or after the expiry of the Consultation Period) an
insolvency event has occurred in relation to any Third Party Chargor, Debtor or other member
of the Group and the Security Agent has not commenced enforcement of the Transaction
Security, then the Security Agent shall act on the enforcement instructions of the Majority Super
Senior Creditors provided that such instructions are consistent with the security enforcement
principles.

If the Majority Super Senior Creditors or Majority Senior Secured Creditors (acting reasonably)
consider at any time that the Security Agent is enforcing the Transaction Security in a manner which
is not consistent with the security enforcement principles, the Creditor Representatives of the other
Super Senior Creditors and Senior Secured Creditors shall consult with the Security Agent for a
period of 10 days (or such lesser period as the relevant Creditor Representatives may agree) with a
view to agreeing the manner of enforcement, provided that the Creditor Representatives are not
obliged to consult in this circumstance more than once in relation to each enforcement.

_Restrictions on Enforcement by the Future Senior Subordinated Debt; standstill_

Prior to the discharge of all the Priority Debt, neither the creditors of any Future Senior Subordinated
Debt (the “Future Senior Subordinated Creditors”) nor the creditor representative of the Future Senior
Subordinated Creditors (the “Future Senior Subordinated Debt Representative”) may take
enforcement action with respect to the Future Senior Subordinated Debt (including any action against
the Issuer or the guarantors of the Future Senior Subordinated Debt (if any)) or direct the Security
Agent to enforce or otherwise require the enforcement of any relevant Transaction Security document
without the prior consent of or as required by the relevant creditor instructing group (as detailed in
“—Security Enforcement” above), except if (1) an event of default has occurred under the Future
Senior Subordinated Debt resulting from failure to pay principal at its original scheduled maturity
or (2):

(a)   an event of default under the debt documents for the Future Senior Subordinated Debt is
continuing;


-----

(b)   the Senior Agent, the Trustee and the other representatives of the Priority Debt have received
notice of the specified event of default from the Future Senior Subordinated Debt
Representative;

(c)   a Standstill Period (as defined below) has expired; and

(d)   the relevant event of default is continuing at the end of the Standstill Period,

provided that in the case of (2) only, no such action may be taken if the Security Agent is acting in
accordance with the instructions of the relevant creditor instructing group (as detailed in “—Security
_Enforcement” above) to take steps for enforcement and such action might reasonably likely adversely_
affect such enforcement.

A “Standstill Period” shall mean the period starting on the date that the Future Senior Subordinated
Debt Representative serves an enforcement notice on the Senior Agent, the Trustee and the
representative of any Future Pari passu Debt until the earliest of:

(a)   the first business day 179 days after such date;

(b)   the date on which the Security Agent takes enforcement action (including the enforcement of
any Transaction Security permitted to be enforced under the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement), provided that the Future Senior Subordinated Debt Representative and holders of
Future Senior Subordinated Debt may only take the same enforcement action against the
same entity as is taken by the Security Agent and may not take any other action against any
other member of the Group or Third Party Chargor;

(c)   the date on which an insolvency event occurs in respect of any Debtor or Third Party Chargor
owing Future Senior Subordinated Liabilities against whom enforcement action is to be taken
(other than as a result of any action taken by a Future Senior Subordinated Creditor);

(d)   the date on which a default under the Future Senior Subordinated Debt occurs for failure to
pay principal at the original scheduled maturity of the Future Senior Subordinated Debt; and

(e)   the expiration of any other Standstill Period which was outstanding at the date that the current
Standstill Period commenced (other than as a result of a cure, waiver or permitted remedy
thereof).

If an Event of Default ceases to be continuing then (provided the relevant parties are made aware of
such fact) any relevant enforcement process (including any requirement of consultation relating to
enforcement) relying solely on that Event of Default shall cease to continue.

**_Security enforcement principles_**

-    The Intercreditor Agreement includes security enforcement principles with the aim of
maximizing, so far as is consistent with prompt and expeditious realization of value from
enforcement of the Transaction Security, the recovery by the creditors of the Priority Liabilities
and (to the extent the Transaction Security is expressed to secure the same) the Future Senior
Subordinated Liabilities (the “Security Enforcement Objective”).

-    The Transaction Security will be enforced and other action as to enforcement will be taken
such that either:

    -    to the extent the instructing group is the Majority Super Senior Creditors, all proceeds of
enforcement are received by the Security Agent in cash or cash equivalent investments
(or substantially all in cash or cash investments); or

    -    to the extent the instructing group is the Majority Super Senior Creditors, either sufficient
proceeds from enforcement will be received by the Security Agent in cash or cash
equivalent investments to ensure that when the proceeds are applied in accordance with
the order of application set forth below under “—Application of Amounts Recovered”, the
Super Senior Liabilities are repaid and discharged in full (unless the Majority Super
Senior Creditors agree otherwise).


-----

-    Enforcement must be prompt and expeditious and, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement, the time frame for the realization of value from the enforcement of the Transaction
Security will be determined by the relevant creditor instructing group provided that it is
consistent with the Security Enforcement Objective.

Where proposed enforcement of Transaction Security is over some or all of the shares in a
member of the Group over which Transaction Security exists,

    -    the Security Agent shall if instructed by the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the
Majority Senior Secured Creditors obtain an opinion from a reputable internationallyrecognized (a) investment bank, (b) accounting firm or (c) other third party professional
firm which is regularly engaged in providing valuations of businesses or assets similar or
comparable to those charged under the Transaction Security to be enforced to opine as
expert: (1) on the optimal method of enforcing the Transaction Security so as to achieve
the Security Enforcement Objective and maximize the recovery of any such
enforcement; (2) that the proceeds received from any such enforcement represent fair
value from a financial point of view after taking into account all relevant circumstances;
and (3) that such sale is otherwise in accordance with the Security Enforcement
Objective. Such opinion save as to manifest error will be conclusive evidence that the
Security Enforcement Objective has been met. If enforcement is conducted by way of a
public auction, no financial adviser shall be required to be appointed.

The Security Enforcement Principals may be amended, varied or waived with the prior written
consent of the Majority Super Senior Creditors, the Majority Senior Secured Creditors and the
Security Agent.

**_Turnover_**
The Intercreditor Agreement provides that if any Primary Creditor (as defined below) receives or
recovers or otherwise realizes the proceeds of any enforcement of any Transaction Security or any
other amounts which should otherwise be received, recovered or realized by the Security Agent
pursuant to the payment waterfall described in “—Application of Amounts Recovered” below and in
addition if any creditor of Future Senior Subordinated Debt receives or recovers any payment or
distribution not permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement or applied other than in accordance with
the “—Application of Amounts Recovered” described below that it shall (subject to certain prior actual
knowledge qualifications in the case of the notes trustees):

-    in relation to receipts or recoveries not received or recovered by way of set-off, (i) hold that
amount on trust for the Security Agent and separate from other assets, property or funds and
promptly pay that amount to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of
the Intercreditor Agreement; and (ii) promptly pay an amount equal to the amount (if any) by
which receipt or recovery exceeds the relevant liabilities owed to such creditor to the Security
Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; and

-    in relation to receipts and recoveries received or recovered by way of set-off, promptly pay an
amount equal to that recovery to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Application of amounts recovered_**
Subject to the rights of creditors mandatorily preferred by law applying to companies generally,
proceeds of enforcement, all recoveries by the Security Agent or all other amounts paid to the
Security Agent pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement shall be applied in the following order of
application:

-    first, in or towards payment of (i) pari passu and pro rata any sum owing to the Security Agent,
any receiver, any delegate and the Trustee and then (ii) pari passu and pro rata any costs and
expenses owing to each Creditor Representative (other than a Creditor Representative that is a
Hedging Bank) and any receiver, attorney or agent appointed by such Creditor Representative,
as between themselves;


-----

-    second, pari passu and pro rata as between themselves in or towards payment of all costs and
expenses incurred by or on behalf of creditors of the Super Senior Liabilities in connection with
the realization or enforcement of the Transaction Security or any action taken at the request of
the Security Agent;

-    third, pari passu and pro rata as between themselves in or towards payment of the Super
Senior Liabilities;

-    fourth, pari passu and pro rata as between themselves in or towards payment of all costs and
expenses incurred by or on behalf of creditors of the Senior Secured Notes Liabilities and the
Future Pari passu Liabilities in connection with the realization or enforcement of the
Transaction Security or any action taken at the request of the Security Agent;

-    fifth, pari passu and pro rata as between themselves in or towards payment of the Senior
Secured Notes Liabilities, the Future Pari passu Liabilities and any Hedging Liabilities that are
not Super Senior Hedging Liabilities;

-    sixth, pari passu and pro rata as between themselves in or towards payment of all costs and
expenses incurred by or on behalf of creditors of the Future Senior Subordinated Liabilities in
connection with the realization or enforcement of the Transaction Security or any action taken
at the request of the Security Agent;

-    seventh, pari passu and pro rata as between themselves in or towards payment of the Future
Senior Subordinated Liabilities; and

-    eighth, after the Final Discharge Date, in payment of the surplus (if any) to the relevant Debtor,
Third Party Chargor or other person entitled to it.

**_Non-Distressed Disposal_**
In circumstances where a disposal or certain other specified transactions are not being effected
pursuant to a Distress Event (as defined below) (a disposal effected pursuant to a Distress Event
being a “Distressed Disposal”) and are otherwise permitted by the terms of the Indenture and the
debt documents for the Future Pari passu Debt and the Future Senior Subordinated Debt and the
finance documents for the New Revolving Credit Facility and any Other Credit Facility Debt, the
Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the Security Agent is authorized and instructed (i) to release
the Transaction Security or any other claim in respect of the liabilities secured by the Transaction
Security; (ii) if the relevant asset consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor, to release the
Transaction Security or any other claim in respect of the liabilities secured by the Transaction Security
over the assets of that Debtor and the shares in and assets of any of its subsidiaries and (iii) execute
and deliver or enter into any release of the Transaction Security or any claim described in paragraphs
(i) and (ii) and issue any certificates of non-crystallization of any floating charge or any consent to
dealing that may, in the discretion of the Security Agent, be considered necessary or desirable.

**_Distressed Disposal_**
Where a Distressed Disposal of an asset is being effected, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide
that the Security Agent is authorized: (i) to release the Transaction Security, or any other claim over
that asset; (ii) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or Third
Party Chargor, to release (a) that Debtor, Third Party Chargor and any subsidiary of that Debtor or
Third Party Chargor (as applicable) from all or any part of its liabilities to the Priority Creditors or
Future Senior Subordinated Creditors or others or otherwise in connection with the Transactions
(“Primary Liabilities”) or other liabilities it may have to a creditor of Shareholder Liabilities (a
“Shareholder Lender”), a creditor of Intra- Group Liabilities (an “Intra-group Lender”) or other Debtors
and Third Party Chargors; (b) any Transaction Security granted by that Debtor, Third Party Chargor or
any subsidiary of that Debtor or Third Party Chargor over any of its assets; and (c) any other claim of
a Shareholder Lender, Intragroup Lender, or another Debtor or Third Party Chargor over that Debtor’s
assets or over the assets of any subsidiary of that Debtor or Third Party Chargor; (iii) if the asset
which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of any holding company of a Debtor or Third
Party Chargor, to release (a) that holding company and any subsidiary of that holding company from
all or any part of its Primary Liabilities and Other Liabilities; (b) any Transaction Security granted by
any subsidiary of that holding company over any of its assets; and (c) any other claim of a


-----

Shareholder Lender, Intragroup Lender or another Debtor over the assets of any subsidiary of that
holding company; and (iv) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a
Debtor or Third Party Chargor or a holding company of a Debtor or Third Party Chargor, to provide,
for (1) the transfer of liabilities to another Debtor or Third Party Chargor and/or (2) at the discretion of
the Security Agent (provided that it is acting in accordance with the Security Enforcement Principles)
the disposal, to third parties, of creditor’s claims against that Debtor or Third Party Chargor or holding
company (which may include claims against the Issuer).

Where borrowing liabilities in respect of any Priority Debt would otherwise be released pursuant to
the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (including as stated above), the primary creditor concerned
may elect to have those borrowing liabilities transferred to Bidco (or its immediate holding company
after the relevant Distressed Disposal), in which case the Security Agent will be irrevocably
authorized (at the cost of the relevant Debtor or Bidco (or its immediate holding company after the
relevant Distressed Disposal) and without any consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation
from any creditor under the Intercreditor Agreement, Debtor or Third Party Chargor to execute such
documents as are required to so transfer those borrowing liabilities.

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected such that the claims of the holders of the Future Senior
Subordinated Debt against the Issuer, any guarantees in respect of the Future Senior Subordinated
Debt and/or Transaction Security securing the Future Senior Subordinated Debt will be released, it is
a condition to the release that either:

(i)    the Future Senior Subordinated Debt Representative has approved the release on the
instructions of the Future Senior Subordinated Debt Required Holders (as defined below); or

(ii)   each of the following conditions are satisfied:

(a)   the proceeds of such sale or disposal are in cash or cash equivalent investments (or
substantially in cash or cash equivalent investments);

(b)   all present or future obligations owed to the secured parties under the Priority Debt
documents by a member of the Group all of whose shares pledged under the
Transaction Security are sold or disposed of pursuant to such enforcement action, are
unconditionally released and discharged or sold or disposed of concurrently with such
sale (and such obligations are not assumed by the purchaser or one of its affiliates), and
all Transaction Security in respect of the assets that are sold or disposed of is
simultaneously and unconditionally released concurrently with such sale; and

(c)   such sale or disposal (including any sale or disposal of any claim) is made:

(1)   pursuant to a public auction in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement; or

(2)   where an internationally recognized investment bank or an internationally
recognized firm of accountants selected by the Security Agent has delivered an
opinion in respect of such sale or disposal that the amount received in connection
therewith is fair from a financial point of view taking into account all relevant
circumstances (although there shall be no obligation to postpone any such sale,
disposal or transfer in order to achieve a higher price) including the method of
enforcement and the circumstances giving rise to such sale, provided that the
liability of such investment bank or internationally recognized firm of accountants
in giving such opinion may be limited to the amount of its fees in respect of such
engagement.

**_Application of Proceeds of a Distressed Disposal_**
The net proceeds of a Distressed Disposal (and the net proceeds of any disposal of liabilities) shall
be paid to the Security Agent (as the case may be) for application in accordance with the provisions
set forth under “—Application of Amounts Recovered” above as if those proceeds were the proceeds
of an enforcement of the Transaction Security and, to the extent that any disposal of liabilities has
occurred, as if the disposal of liabilities had not occurred.


-----

**_Option to purchase_**
Following:

(a)   an Acceleration Event; or

(b)   the enforcement of any Transaction Security,

(each, “Distress Event”),

the holders of the Senior Secured Notes and Future Pari passu Debt shall have an option to
purchase all (but not part) of the commitments of the Lenders under the New Revolving Credit Facility
(or their affiliates) and all their exposures in respect of any Hedging Agreement at par plus accrued
interest and all other amounts owing under the New Revolving Credit Facility and Hedging
Agreements, with such purchase to occur all at the same time.

Following a Distress Event, the holders of the Future Senior Subordinated Debt shall have an option
to purchase all (but not part) of the Priority Debt at par plus accrued interest and all other amounts
owing in respect of such Priority Debt, with such purchase to occur all at the same time.

**_Voting and amendments_**
Voting in respect of the New Revolving Credit Facility, the Senior Secured Notes and/or Future Pari
_passu Debt will be in accordance with the relevant documents._

Except (i) for amendments of a minor, technical or administrative nature which may be effected by the
Security Agent (ii) amendments and waivers to the security enforcement principles, which may be
effected as described above in “—Security Enforcement Principles” and subject to the paragraph

provided that to the extent an amendment, waiver or consent only affects one class of secured party,

interests of the other classes of secured party, only written agreement from the affected class shall be
required. Notwithstanding the paragraph immediately above, an amendment or waiver relating to
provisions dealing with (i) ranking and priority or subordination, (ii) turnover of Receipts, (iii)
redistribution, (iv) enforcement of Transaction Security, (v) disposal proceeds, (vi) application of

senior credit facility;

(f)    Bidco.

Prior to the discharge of all the Priority Debt, the Future Senior Subordinated Debt Representative
may not without the consent of the majority lenders under the New Revolving Credit Facility or Other
Credit Facility Debt amend or waive the terms of the debt documents of the Future Senior
Subordinated Debt to the extent that it would result in them being inconsistent with the agreed major
terms for such Future Senior Subordinated Debt.

**_Definitions_**

**_Governing law_**
The Intercreditor Agreement is governed by English law.

**Project Finance Facilities**
A number of our non-wholly owned subsidiaries have entered into certain financing arrangements
with banks in order to finance the construction of parking infrastructure under our concession


-----

contracts. These financing arrangements are non-recourse project financing arrangements, in which
the lenders only have recourse against the subsidiary that is the borrower under the arrangement
(and its assets and, in some cases, its capital stock), and not to other members of the Group. As of
June 30, 2017, after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions, we had €59.2 million of indebtedness
outstanding under our Project Finance Facilities.

Set forth below is a summary of the key Project Finance Facilities that we expect to remain
outstanding upon completion of the Transactions, including the Debt Repayment.

-    Construction of Oquendo (San Sebastian). During 2006, Guipuzcoa Parking Siglo XXI S.A.,
which is 60% owned by our wholly-owned subsidiary Estacionamientos Guipuzcoanos, S.L.U.,
entered into a loan agreement with the Spanish bank Caja de Ahorros y Monte de Piedad de
Guipuzcoa y San Sebastian—Guipuzkoa Eta Donostiako Aurrezki Kutxa. The original amount
of the loan extended under this agreement was €33.3 million. The amortization payments
under the loan commenced in 2008, and the loan has a final maturity in December 2035. The
loan is secured by a mortgage over the concession to expand and operate the off- street
parking facility Oquendo (San Sebastian) held by the borrower. As of June 30, 2017, the total
outstanding amount under the loan was €25.8 million and the interest rate was EURIBOR plus
0.65%.

-    Construction of La Concha (San Sebastian). During 2009, Concha Parking, S.A, which is 60%
owned by Estacionamientos Guipuzcoanos, S.L.U., our wholly owned subsidiary, entered into a
loan facility with a group of Spanish banks. The original amount of this loan was €31.1 million.
The amortization payments under the loan commenced in January 2012, and the loan has a
final maturity in August 2029. This loan is secured by a mortgage over the concession to
operate an off-street parking facility in San Sebastian. As of June 30, 2017, the total
outstanding amount under the loan was €21.8 million and the interest rate was EURIBOR plus
2.5%.

This loan agreement imposes restrictions on the ability of the borrower to make distributions to
its shareholders. Distributions are permitted only in the form of dividends against the net profit
of the borrower for the prior fiscal year and the borrower may not make any distributions prior
to making 24 amortization payments under the credit facility. As a result, no distributions are
permitted to be paid prior to January 2018. Other forms of remuneration, such as the payment
of management fees, are also not permitted under the terms of the facility.

-    Construction of Plaza de Cataluña (San Sebastian). During 2010 Aparcamientos Gipuzcoanos,
S.L, which is 60% owned by our wholly-owned subsidiary Estacionamientos Gipuzcoanos,
S.L.U. entered into a loan agreement with a group of Spanish banks. The original amount of
this loan facility was €12.2 million. The amortization payments under the loan commenced in
January 2012 and the loan has a final maturity in October 2029. The loan is secured by a
mortgage over the concession to operate an off-street parking concession, Plaza de Cataluña,
in San Sebastian. As of June 30, 2017, the total outstanding amount under the loan was
€10.8 million and the interest rate was EURIBOR plus 2.75%.

The loan agreement imposes restrictions on the ability of the borrower to make distributions to
its shareholders. Distributions are permitted only in the form of dividends from the net profit of
the borrower for the prior fiscal year and the borrower may not make any distributions prior to
making 12 amortization payments under the credit facility. As a result, no distributions are
permitted to be paid prior to October 2014. Before making a distribution, the borrower must
also meet certain other financial ratios. Other forms of capital remuneration, such as the
payment of management fees, are also not permitted under the terms of the facility.

We are in the process of obtaining change of control waivers in respect of the Concha Parking S.A.
facility and the Aparcamientos Guipuzcoanos, S.L. facility. We expect to receive such waivers prior to
the Completion Date. However, in the event we do not receive such waivers, we intend to refinance
these facilities with new project finance facilities. In the event we are unable to refinance with new
project finance facilities, we intend to draw down on the Revolving Credit Facility to temporarily
refinance such facilities until we obtain long-term refinancing.

Arena Luxembourg Finance S.à r.l., a société à responsabilité limitée organized under the laws of
Luxembourg (the “Issuer”) will issue € million aggregate principal amount of % Senior
Secured Notes due 2024 (the “Fixed Rate Notes”) and € million aggregate principal amount of

London Branch, as Security Agent, in a private transaction that is not subject to the registration
requirements of the US Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “US Securities Act”).

Pending the initiation of the transactions which upon the consummation thereof will result in the
Acquisition and the satisfaction of certain other conditions as described under the caption “—Escrow
_of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption”, the Issuer will, concurrently with the closing of the_
Offering of the Notes on the Issue Date, instruct the initial purchasers to deposit the gross proceeds
from the Offering of the Notes into escrow accounts for each of the proceeds from the Fixed Rate

aggregate initial issue price of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, and Additional Amounts, if
any, from the Issue Date, to, but not including, the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (the “Special
_Mandatory Redemption Price”). The Issuer or the Parent Guarantor will not be required to make a_
Special Mandatory Redemption following the Release (as defined below) on the Escrow Release
Date (as defined below). See the caption “—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption”.


-----

**Brief Description of the Notes, the Proceeds Loans and the Note Guarantees**
On the Completion Date, the Issuer will use the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes issued on
the Issue Date to make two proceeds loans to Bidco (the “Debt Repayment Proceeds Loan” and the
“Acquisition and Fees Proceeds Loan” and, together the “Proceeds Loans”) pursuant to proceeds
loan agreements, the total principal amount of which shall be equal to the aggregate principal amount
of the Notes issued on the Issue Date. Each Proceeds Loan will be tranched to reflect the respective
net proceeds on-lent from the Fixed Rate Notes and the Floating Rate Notes issued on the Issue
Date. The Proceeds Loans will provide that the borrower under each of the Proceeds Loans
thereunder will pay to the lender thereunder interest and principal as it becomes payable on the
corresponding series of Notes (including any additional amounts due thereunder).

The proceeds of the Debt Repayment Proceeds Loan will be used to repay existing debt outstanding
at the Target Group in an aggregate amount of €424.0 million, including (i) the redemption in full of
the Existing Notes, and (ii) the repayment of amounts outstanding under certain Project Finance
Facilities (as defined elsewhere in the Offering Memorandum) as well as certain loans and leases.

and the other Subsidiary Guarantors from the Completion Date as set forth below under the
caption “—The Guarantors”; and

Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors, including the Project Finance Facilities.

The Proceeds Loans will be:

-     general unsecured senior obligations of Bidco;

-     effectively subordinated to all existing and future secured borrowings of Bidco to the extent of
the value of the assets so secured; and

-     effectively subordinated (in an insolvency proceeding) to any non-related third party borrowings
of Bidco, except for those borrowings that have been set aside as fraudulent by a court.

The tranches of the Proceeds Loans that correspond to the net proceeds from the Fixed Rate Notes
will bear interest at a rate at least equal to the interest rate of the Fixed Rate Notes, and interest on
the tranches of the Proceeds Loans that correspond to the net proceeds from the Fixed Rate Notes
will be payable semi-annually in arrears on or before the corresponding interest payment date under
the Fixed Rate Notes. The tranches of the Proceeds Loans that correspond to the net proceeds from
the Floating Rate Notes will bear interest at a floating rate at least equal to the interest rate of the
Floating Rate Notes, and interest on the the tranches of the Proceeds Loans that correspond to the


-----

net proceeds from the Floating Rate Notes will be payable quarterly in arrears on or before the
corresponding interest payment date under the Floating Rate Notes.

The maturity dates of the tranches of the Proceeds Loans will be the same as the maturity dates of
the applicable Notes. Except as otherwise required by law, all payments under the Proceeds Loans
will be made without deductions or withholding for, or on account of, any applicable tax. In the event
that Bidco is required to make any such deduction or withholding, such entity will gross-up each
payment to the Issuer to ensure that the Issuer receives and retains a net payment equal to the
payment which it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made. Upon the
issuance of any Additional Notes, the proceeds thereof will be loaned to Bidco pursuant to an
additional loan, loans or tranches thereof on substantially the same terms as the Proceeds Loans.

**_The Note Guarantees_**
On the Issue Date, the Notes will be guaranteed by the Parent Guarantor (and secured by the
Escrow Charge). On the Completion Date, the Notes will be guaranteed by Bidco, provided Bidco has
been converted into a sociedad anónima at that date (and, if Bidco has not been converted into a
_sociedad anónima by the Completion Date, Bidco will provide its guarantee within five Business Days_
of conversion). Bidco is currently in the process of being converted into a sociedad anónima and it is
expected to take place within approximately two to four months following the Issue Date. Within 90
days following the Completion Date the Notes will be guaranteed by the other Subsidiary Guarantors
as further described under the caption “—The Guarantors”. The Note Guarantee of each Guarantor:

-     will be a senior secured obligation of such Guarantor, secured by the Collateral as set forth
below under the caption “—Security”;

-     will rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future Indebtedness of that
Guarantor that is not subordinated in right of payment to the Note Guarantee of that Guarantor;

-     will rank senior in right of payment with any existing and any future Indebtedness of such
Guarantor that is subordinated in right of payment to the relevant Note;

-     will be effectively subordinated in right of payment to any existing or future Indebtedness of
such Guarantor that is secured by property and assets that do not secure such Note
Guarantee, to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such Indebtedness;
and

-     will be structurally subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness of such Guarantor’s
Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors, including the Project Financing Facilities.

The obligations of a Guarantor under its Note Guarantee will be contractually limited under the
applicable Note Guarantees to reflect limitations under applicable law with respect to maintenance of
share capital, corporate benefit, fraudulent conveyance, financial assistance and other legal
restrictions applicable to the Guarantors and their respective shareholders, directors and general
partners. For a description of such contractual limitations, see “Limitations on Validity and
_Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”. In_
particular, (a) the Note Guarantees of Empark (as defined herein), Dornier, S.A.U. (“Dornier”) and
Estacionamientos Infraestructuras, S.A.U. (“Infraestructuras”) will be limited to the value of the Debt
Repayment Proceeds Loan (which is expected to be approximately €424.0 million) and will not
guarantee those obligations or liabilities which, if guaranteed, will constitute an infringement of
Spanish financial assistance laws in accordance with Articles 143.2 and 150 of the Spanish
Companies Act (see “Risk Factors—Risk Relating to the Notes—Spanish Guarantee and Collateral
_Limitations”) and (b) in order to avoid Portuguese financial assistance issues, the Note Guarantees of_
Emparque (as defined herein) and Esli-Parques de Estacionamento, S.A. (“Esli”) will be limited to a
maximum amount of €29.97 million and €25.32 million (respectively) for the Notes and the Revolving
Credit Facility, which represents part of the value of the Debt Repayment Proceeds Loan. For a brief
description of such limitations, see “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes—Certain of the Note
_Guarantees will be limited to a specified amount, and each Note Guarantee will be subject to certain_
_limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that_
_may limit its validity and enforceability” and “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the_
_Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”._


-----

Not all of the Subsidiaries of the Parent Guarantor will be Guarantors. In the event of a bankruptcy,
liquidation or reorganization of any of these non-guarantor Subsidiaries, the non-guarantor
Subsidiaries will pay the holders of their debt and their trade creditors before they will be able to
distribute any of their assets to the Issuer or the Guarantors.

For the twelve months ended and as of June 30, 2017, after giving pro forma effect to the
Transactions, the Guarantors represented 72.1% of our Adjusted Revenue, 80.1% of our Adjusted
EBITDA and 80.8% of our total assets (and 76.2% of our tangible and intangible assets, excluding
goodwill), in each case excluding the results and assets of our non-wholly owned subsidiaries and
our Non-Recourse Restricted Subsidiaries. For the twelve months ended and as of June 30, 2017,
our non-wholly owned subsidiaries and our Non-Recourse Restricted Subsidiaries, collectively,
generated €35.1 million and €12.3 million of the Group’s Adjusted Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA,
respectively, and held €171.5 million of the Group’s total assets (and €129.2 million of the Group’s
tangible and intangible assets, excluding goodwill). For the twelve months ended and as of June 30,
2017, the Non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries represented 27.9% of our Adjusted Revenue, 19.9%
of our Adjusted EBITDA and 19.2% of our total assets (and 23.8% of our tangible and intangible
assets, excluding goodwill), in each case excluding the results and assets of our non-wholly owned
subsidiaries and our Non-Recourse Restricted Subsidiaries. As of June 30, 2017, after giving pro
_forma effect to the Transactions, the non-Guarantor Subsidiaries had €72.1 million of Gross debt_
outstanding, including €59.2 million in Project Finance Facilities. For further information see
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements”.

The Issuer is a special purpose vehicle initially formed for the purpose of issuing the Notes and any
Additional Notes permitted to be issued under the Indenture. The Parent Guarantor and Bidco are
holding companies. Each of the Parent Guarantor and Bidco will after the Completion Date conduct
all of its operations through its Subsidiaries, and, therefore, will depend on the cash flow of its
Subsidiaries to meet its obligations, including (in the case of Bidco) under the Proceeds Loans.
Claims of creditors of the non-guarantor Subsidiaries, including trade creditors and creditors holding
indebtedness or guarantees issued by such non-guarantor Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred
stockholders of such non-guarantor Subsidiaries, generally will have priority with respect to the assets
and earnings of such non-guarantor Subsidiaries over the claims of the Issuer’s creditors, including
holders of the Notes. Accordingly, the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be effectively subordinated
to creditors and preferred stockholders, if any, of such non-guarantor Subsidiaries. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Relating to Our Structure—The Notes will each be structurally subordinated to the_
_liabilities of non-Guarantor subsidiaries”._

As of the Issue Date and as of the Completion Date, all of the Parent Guarantor’s Subsidiaries will be
“Restricted Subsidiaries” for purposes of the Indenture. However, subject to compliance with the
terms of the Indenture, the Parent Guarantor will be permitted to designate Restricted Subsidiaries
(other than the Issuer) as “Unrestricted Subsidiaries”. The restrictive covenants in the Indenture do
not apply to Unrestricted Subsidiaries.

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**
The Issuer will issue €475 million in aggregate principal amount of Notes in this Offering. The Issuer
may issue additional Fixed Rate Notes (the “Additional Fixed Rate Notes”) and additional Floating
Rate Notes (the “Additional Floating Rate Notes” and together with the Additional Fixed Rate Notes,
the “Additional Notes”) under the Indenture from time to time after this Offering. Any issuance of
Additional Notes is subject to the covenants in the Indenture. The Notes and any Additional Notes
subsequently issued under the Indenture will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the
Indenture, including, without limitation, waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase,
except as otherwise provided in the Indenture. The Issuer will issue Notes in denominations of
€100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The Fixed Rate Notes will mature
on, 2024. The Floating Rate Notes will mature on, 2023.

**_Fixed Rate Notes_**
Interest on the Fixed Rate Notes will accrue at the rate of % per annum. Interest on the Fixed
Rate Notes will be payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on and of each year
commencing on,, 2018. The Issuer will make each interest payment to the Holders of record
of the Fixed Rate Notes on the immediately preceding and . If a particular interest


-----

payment date is not a Business Day at the place at which such payment is to be made, then the
payment date will be the next Business Day at such place and the holders of Notes will not be
entitled to any further interest in the intervening period or other payment as a result of any such
delays. The redemption price at maturity will be 100% of the par value of the Fixed Rate Notes.

Interest on the Fixed Rate Notes will accrue from the date of original issuance or, if interest has
already been paid, from the date it was most recently paid. Interest will be computed on the basis of
a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. Interest on overdue principal and interest on the
Fixed Rate Notes, including Additional Amounts, if any, will accrue at a rate that is 1.0% higher than
the interest rate on the Fixed Rate Notes. In no event will the rate of interest on the Fixed Rate Notes
be higher than the maximum rate permitted by applicable law.

**_Floating Rate Notes_**
Interest on the Floating Rate Notes will be payable quarterly in arrears on,, and
of each year, commencing on, 2018. The Issuer will make each interest payment to the
holders of record on the immediately preceding,, and . If a particular
interest payment date is not a Business Day at the place at which such payment is to be made, then
the payment date will be the next Business Day at such place and the holders of Notes will not be
entitled to any further interest in the intervening period or other payment as a result of any such
delays. The redemption price at maturity will be 100% of the par value of the Floating Rate Notes.

Each Floating Rate Note will bear interest at a rate per annum (the “Applicable Rate”), reset quarterly,
equal to EURIBOR plus %, as determined by the calculation agent (the “Calculation Agent”),
which will initially be The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch.

Interest on the Floating Rate Notes will accrue from the date of original issuance or, if interest has
already been paid, from the date it was most recently paid. Interest will be computed on the basis of
the actual number of days in the interest period concerned divided by 360. Interest on overdue
principal and interest on the Fixed Rate Notes, including Additional Amounts, if any, will accrue at a
rate that is 1.0% higher than the interest rate on the Fixed Rate Notes. In no event will the rate of
interest on the Fixed Rate Notes be higher than the maximum rate permitted by applicable law.

Set forth below is a summary of certain of the provisions from the Indenture relating to the calculation
of interest on the Floating Rate Notes.

“Determination Date” with respect to an Interest Period, means the day that is two TARGET
Settlement Days preceding the first day of such Interest Period, except that the initial Determination
Date will be .

“EURIBOR” with respect to an Interest Period, means the rate (expressed as a percentage per
annum) for deposits in euro for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET
Settlement Days after the Determination Date that appears on Reuters Page 248 as of 11:00 a.m.
Brussels time, on the Determination Date. If Reuters Page 248 does not include such a rate or is
unavailable on a Determination Date, then the rate for the Interest Period will be the rate in effect with
respect to the immediately preceding Interest Period.

“Euro-zone” means the region comprised of member states of the European Union that adopt the
euro.

“Interest Period” means the period commencing on and including an interest payment date and
ending on and including the day immediately preceding the next succeeding interest payment date,
with the exception that the first Interest Period will commence on and include the Issue Date and end
on and include, 2018.

“Representative Amount” means the greater of (i) €1,000,000 and (ii) an amount that is representative
for a single transaction in the relevant market at the relevant time.

“Reuters Page 248” means the display page so designated by Reuters (or such other page as may
replace that page on that service, or such other service as may be nominated as the information
vendor).


-----

“TARGET Settlement Day” means any day on which the Trans-European Automated Real-Time Gross
Settlement Express Transfer (TARGET) System is open.

The Calculation Agent will, as soon as practicable after 11:00 a.m. (London time) on each
Determination Date, determine the Applicable Rate and calculate the aggregate amount of interest
payable in respect of the following Interest Period (the “Interest Amount”). The Interest Amount will be
calculated by applying the Applicable Rate to the principal amount of each Floating Rate Note
outstanding at the commencement of the Interest Period, multiplying each such amount by the actual
amounts of days in the Interest Period concerned divided by 360. All percentages resulting from any
of the above calculations will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred thousandth of a
percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point being rounded upwards
(e.g., 4.876545% (or .04876545) being rounded to 4.87655% (or .0487655)). The determination of
the Applicable Rate and the Interest Amount by the Calculation Agent will, in the absence of willful
default, bad faith or manifest error, be final and binding on all parties. In no event will the rate of
interest on the Floating Rate Notes be higher than the maximum rate permitted by applicable law.

**Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes**
The Issuer will maintain one or more paying agents (each, a “Paying Agent”) for the Notes in London,
United Kingdom. The initial Paying Agent will be The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch.

The Issuer will also maintain one or more registrars (each, a “Registrar”) and a transfer agent (the
“Transfer Agent”). The initial Registrar will be The Bank of New York Mellon SA/NV, Luxembourg
Branch. The initial Transfer Agent will be The Bank of New York Mellon SA/NV, Luxembourg Branch.
The Registrar and the Transfer Agent maintain a register reflecting ownership of Definitive Registered
Notes outstanding from time to time and will make payments on and facilitate transfers of Definitive
Registered Notes on behalf of the Issuer.

The Issuer may change each of the Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent without prior notice to
the holders of such Notes. For so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange and admitted for trading on the Euro MTF market and the rules of this exchange so
require, the Issuer will publish a notice of any change of Paying Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar in
a newspaper having a general circulation in Luxembourg (currently expected to be the Luxemburger
Wort) or the website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu).

**Transfer and Exchange**
Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the
US Securities Act (“Rule 144A”) will initially be represented by one or more global Notes in registered
form without interest coupons attached (the “144A Global Note”), and Notes sold outside the United
States pursuant to Regulation S under the US Securities Act (“Regulation S”) will initially be
represented by one or more global Notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the
“Regulation S Global Note” and, together with the 144A Global Note, the “Global Notes”).

During the “40-day distribution compliance period” (as such term is defined in Rule 902 of Regulation
S), book-entry interests in the Regulation S Global Note may be transferred only to non-US Persons
under Regulation S or to persons whom the transferor reasonably believes are “qualified institutional
_buyers” within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or_
otherwise in accordance with applicable transfer restrictions and any applicable securities laws of any
state of the United States or any other jurisdiction. The Notes will be subject to certain other
restrictions on transfer and certification requirements, as described under the caption “Notice to
_Investors.”_

Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that
have accounts with Euroclear or Clearstream (each as defined elsewhere in this Offering
Memorandum) or Persons that may hold interests through such participants. Ownership of interests in
the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions on transfer and
certification requirements summarized below and described more fully under the caption “Notice to
_Investors.” In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in Euroclear or_
Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear or Clearstream pursuant to customary procedures and


-----

subject to the applicable rules and procedures established by Euroclear or Clearstream and their
respective participants.

Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in
the form of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Note only upon delivery by the transferor
of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being
made in accordance with Regulation S.

No Book-Entry Interest in any Global Note representing the Fixed Rate Notes (the “Global Fixed Rate
_Notes”) and no Definitive Registered Note issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest in the Global_
Fixed Rate Notes (the “Definitive Registered Fixed Rate Notes”) may be transferred or exchanged for
any Book-Entry Interest in any Global Note representing the Floating Rate Notes (the “Global Floating
_Rate Notes”) or any Definitive Registered Note issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest in the_
Global Floating Rate Notes (the “Definitive Registered Floating Rate Notes”), and no Book-Entry
Interest in the Global Floating Rate Notes and no Definitive Registered Floating Rate Note may be
transferred or exchanged for any Book-Entry Interest in any Global Fixed Rate Note or any Definitive
Registered Fixed Rate Note.

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will,
upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and
will become a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from
and after such transfer, it will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures
applicable to Book-Entry Interests in the Global Note to which it was transferred.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of
€100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, upon receipt by the Registrar of
instructions relating thereto and any certificates and other documentation required by the Indenture. It
is expected that such instructions will be based upon directions received by Euroclear or
Clearstream, as applicable, from the participant which owns the relevant Book-Entry Interests.
Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth in
the Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Issuer in compliance with applicable law, be subject
to, and will have a legend with respect to, the restrictions on transfer summarized below and
described more fully under the caption “Notice to Investors.”

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes
may be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of €100,000 and
integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, to persons who take delivery thereof in the form of
Definitive Registered Notes. In connection with any such transfer or exchange, the Indenture will
require the transferring or exchanging holder to, among other things, furnish appropriate
endorsements and transfer documents, furnish information regarding the account of the transferee at
Euroclear or Clearstream, where appropriate, furnish certain certificates and opinions, and pay any
Taxes (as defined herein) in connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or
exchange will be made without charge to the holder, other than any Taxes payable in connection with
such transfer or exchange.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer is not required to register the transfer of any Definitive
Registered Notes:

(1)   for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of the Notes;

(2)   for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of Notes to be
redeemed in part;

(3)   for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date; or

(4)   which the holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change
of Control Offer or an Asset Sale Offer.

**Additional Amounts**
All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer (including any successor entity) under or with
respect to the Notes (whether or not in the form of Definitive Registered Notes) or any of the
Guarantors (including any successor entities) with respect to any Note Guarantee will be made free


-----

and clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any present or future Taxes
imposed or levied by or on behalf of (1) any jurisdiction in which the Issuer or any Guarantor is then
incorporated or organized, or otherwise resident for tax purposes or any political subdivision thereof
or therein having the power to Tax or (2) any jurisdiction from or through which payment is made by
or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor (including the jurisdiction of any Paying Agent) or any
political subdivision thereof or therein (each, a “Tax Jurisdiction”) unless the withholding or deduction
of such Taxes is then required by law. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any such
Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of the relevant Tax Jurisdiction will at any time be required to
be made from any payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer under or with respect to the Notes or
any of the Guarantors under or with respect to any Note Guarantee, including payments of principal,
redemption price, purchase price, interest or premium, the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as
applicable, will pay such additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary in order
that the net amounts received in respect of such payments by the registered holder after such
withholding, deduction or imposition (including any such withholding, deduction or imposition from
such Additional Amounts) will equal the respective amounts that would have been received in respect
of such payments in the absence of such withholding or deduction; provided, however, that no
Additional Amounts will be payable with respect to:

(1)   any Taxes that would not have been imposed but for the existence of any actual or deemed
(pursuant to applicable Tax law of the relevant Tax Jurisdiction, such as, if applicable, a
connection of a partnership that is attributed to the partners/beneficial owners) present or
former connection between the registered holder or the beneficial owner of the Notes and the
relevant Tax Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, the holder or beneficial owner being, or
having been, a citizen, national or resident, being, or having been, engaged in a trade or
business, being, or having been, physically present in or having or having had a permanent
establishment in such jurisdiction for Tax purposes), other than any connection arising from the
acquisition or holding of such Note, the enforcement of rights under such Note or under a Note
Guarantee or the receipt of any payments in respect of such Note or a Note Guarantee;

(2)   any Taxes withheld, deducted or imposed as a result of the presentation of a Note for payment
(where Notes are in the form of Definitive Registered Notes and where presentation is
required) more than 30 days after the relevant payment is first made available for payment to
the holder (except to the extent that the holder would have been entitled to Additional Amounts
had the Note been presented on the last day of such 30 day period);

(3)   any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, personal property, transfer or similar Taxes;

(4)   any Taxes that are not payable by way of deduction or withholding from payments under, or
with respect to, the Notes or with respect to any Note Guarantee;

(5)   any Taxes imposed or withheld by reason of the failure of the holder or beneficial owner of
Notes to comply with any reasonable written request of the Issuer or any Guarantor addressed
to the holder or beneficial owner, as the case may be, and made at least 60 days before any
such withholding or deduction would be payable to satisfy any certification, identification,
information or other reporting requirements, whether required by statute, treaty, regulation or
administrative practice of a Tax Jurisdiction, as a precondition to exemption from, or reduction
in the rate of deduction or withholding of, Taxes imposed by the Tax Jurisdiction (including,
without limitation, a certification that the holder or beneficial owner is not resident in the Tax
Jurisdiction), but in each case, only to the extent the holder or beneficial owner is legally
entitled to provide such certification or documentation;

(6)   any Tax imposed on or with respect to any payment by the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor to
the holder for the benefit of a beneficial owner if such holder or beneficial owner is a fiduciary
or partnership or person other than the sole beneficial owner of such payment to the extent
that Taxes would not have been imposed on such payment had such holder or beneficial owner
been the sole beneficial owner of such Notes;

(7)   Notes held by or on behalf of a holder who does not provide to the Issuer or an agent acting on
behalf of the Issuer the information concerning such holder as may be required in order to
comply with the procedures that may be implemented to comply with any interpretation of
Royal Decree 1065/2007 eventually made by the Spanish tax authorities; or


-----

(8)   any combination of items (1) through (7) above.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor shall be permitted to withhold or
deduct any amounts required by the rules of US Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
“US Internal Revenue Code”), Sections 1471 through 1474 (or any amended or successor
provisions), pursuant to any inter-governmental agreement or implementing legislation adopted by
another jurisdiction in connection with these provisions, or pursuant to any agreement with the US
Internal Revenue Service (“FATCA withholding”) as a result of a holder, beneficial owner or an
intermediary not being entitled to receive payments free of FATCA withholding. Neither the Issuer nor
a Guarantor will have any obligation to pay Additional Amounts or otherwise indemnify an investor for
any such FATCA withholding deducted or withheld by the Issuer, a Guarantor, the Paying Agent or
any other party.

In addition to the foregoing, the Issuer and the Guarantors will also pay and indemnify the holder for
any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court or documentary Taxes, or any other excise or
property Taxes, charges or similar levies (including penalties, interest and any other reasonable
expenses related thereto) which are levied by any Tax Jurisdiction on the execution, delivery,
issuance, enforcement or registration of any of the Notes, the Indenture, any Notes Guarantee or any
other document or instrument referred to therein, or enforcement of, any of the Notes or any Notes
Guarantee (other than on or in connection with a transfer of the Notes other than the initial resale of
the Notes by the Initial Purchasers) or the receipt of any payments with respect thereto (limited, solely
in the case of taxes attributable to the receipt of any payments with respect thereto, to any such
taxes imposed in a Tax Jurisdiction that are not excluded under clauses (1) through (3) and (5)
through (6) or any combination thereof).

If the Issuer or any Guarantor, as the case may be, becomes aware that it will be obligated to pay
Additional Amounts with respect to any payment under or with respect to the Notes or any Notes
Guarantee, each of the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as the case may be, will deliver to the
Trustee and the Paying Agent on a date that is at least 30 days prior to the date of that payment
(unless the obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to that payment date,
in which case the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor shall notify the Trustee promptly thereafter) an
Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount estimated
to be so payable. The Officer’s Certificate(s) must also set forth any other information necessary to
enable the Paying Agents to pay such Additional Amounts to holders on the relevant payment date.
The Issuer and the relevant Guarantor will provide the Trustee and the Paying Agent with
documentation satisfactory to the Trustee and the Paying Agent evidencing the payment of Additional
Amounts. The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely solely without independent
investigation on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.

The Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will make all withholdings and deductions required by law and
will remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Tax authority in accordance with
applicable law. The Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will use its reasonable efforts to obtain Tax
receipts from each Tax authority evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld. The
Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will furnish to the Trustee and the Paying Agent, within a reasonable
time after the date the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld is made, certified copies of Tax
receipts evidencing payment by the Issuer or a Guarantor, as the case may be, or if, notwithstanding
such entity’s efforts to obtain receipts, receipts are not obtained, other evidence of payments
(reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee and the Paying Agent) by such entity. Upon reasonable
request, copies of Tax receipts or other evidence of payments, as the case may be, will be made
available by the Trustee and the Paying Agent to the holders or beneficial owners of the Notes.

Whenever in the Indenture or in this “Description of Notes” there is mentioned, in any context, the
payment of amounts based upon the principal amount of the Notes or of principal, interest or of any
other amount payable under, or with respect to, any of the Notes or any Note Guarantee, such
mention shall be deemed to include mention of the payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that,
in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The above obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture, any
transfer by a holder or beneficial owner of its Notes, and will apply, mutatis mutandis, to any
jurisdiction in which any successor Person to the Issuer or any Guarantor is incorporated, engaged in
business or otherwise resident for Tax purposes or any jurisdiction from or through which such


-----

Person makes any payment on the Notes (or any Note Guarantee) and any department or political
subdivision thereof or therein having the power to Tax.

**The Guarantors**
The Notes will be guaranteed:

(a)   on the Issue Date by the Parent Guarantor;

(b)   on the Completion Date by Bidco, provided Bidco has been converted into a sociedad anónima
at that date (and, if Bidco has not been converted into a sociedad anónima by the Completion
Date, Bidco will provide its guarantee within five Business Days of conversion);

(c)   within 90 days of the Completion Date by Empark, Emparque, Dornier, Esli, and
Infraestructuras.

Not all of the Subsidiaries of the Parent Guarantor will be Guarantors. In the event of a bankruptcy,
liquidation or reorganization of any of these non-guarantor Subsidiaries, the non-guarantor
Subsidiaries will pay the holders of their debt and their trade creditors before they will be able to
distribute any of their assets to the Issuer. For the twelve months ended and as of June 30, 2017, the
Non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries represented 27.9% of our Adjusted Revenue, 19.9% of our
Adjusted EBITDA and 19.2% of our total assets (and 23.8% of our tangible and intangible assets,
excluding goodwill), in each case excluding the results and assets of our non-wholly owned
subsidiaries and our Non-Recourse Restricted Subsidiaries. For the twelve months ended and as of
June 30, 2017, our non-wholly owned subsidiaries and our Non-Recourse Restricted Subsidiaries,
collectively, generated €35.1 million and €12.3 million of the Group’s Adjusted Revenue and Adjusted
EBITDA, respectively, and held €171.5 million of the Group’s total assets (and €129.2 million of the
Group’s tangible and intangible assets, excluding goodwill). As of June 30, 2017, after giving pro
_forma effect to the Transactions, the non-Guarantor Subsidiaries had €72.1 million of Gross debt_
outstanding, including €59.2 million in Project Finance Facilities. For further information see
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements”.

The Indenture will provide that the Issuer, each Guarantor and the Trustee will be authorized (without
any further consent of the holders of the Notes) to enter into the Intercreditor Agreement to give effect
to the provisions described under the caption “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
_Intercreditor Agreement”._

The Indenture will also provide that each holder of the Notes, by accepting its Note, will be deemed
to have:

1.    appointed and authorized the Trustee to give effect to the provisions in the Intercreditor
Agreement;

2.    agreed to be bound by the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement; and

3.    irrevocably appointed the Trustee to act on its behalf to enter into and comply with the
provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement.

The obligations of the Guarantors will be contractually limited under the Guarantees to reflect
limitations under applicable law with respect to maintenance of share capital, corporate benefit,
fraudulent conveyance, financial assistance, thin capitalization, distributable reserves and other legal
restrictions applicable to the Guarantors and their respective shareholders, directors and general
partners. For a description of such contractual limitations, see “Limitations on Validity and
_Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”. In_
particular, (a) the Note Guarantees of Empark, Dornier and Infraestructuras will be limited to the value
of the Debt Repayment Proceeds Loan (which is expected to be approximately €424.0 million) and
will not secure those obligations or liabilities which, if secured, will constitute an infringement of
Spanish financial assistance laws in accordance with Articles 143.2 and 150 of the Spanish
Companies Act and (b) in order to avoid Portuguese financial assistance issues, the Note Guarantees
of Emparque and Esli will be limited to a maximum amount of €29.97 million and €25.32 million
(respectively) for both the Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility, which represents part of the value
of the Debt Repayment Proceeds Loan. For a brief description of such limitations, see “Risk
_Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes—Certain of the Note Guarantees will be limited to a specified_


-----

_amount, and each Note Guarantee will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be_
_limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability”_
and “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain
_Insolvency Law Considerations”._

The Note Guarantee of a Subsidiary Guarantor will terminate and be released:

(1)   in connection with any sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of all or
substantially all of the assets of that Guarantor (including by way of merger, consolidation,
amalgamation or combination) to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to
such transaction) the Parent Guarantor or a Restricted Subsidiary, if the sale, assignment,
transfer, conveyance or other disposition does not violate the “Asset Sale” provisions of the
Indenture (as those provisions may be amended from time to time);

(2)   in connection with any sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of Capital
Stock of that Guarantor (or Capital Stock of any Parent Holdco of such Guarantor) to a Person
that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) the Parent Guarantor or a
Restricted Subsidiary, if the sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition does
not violate the “Asset Sale” provisions of the Indenture and the Guarantor ceases to be a
Restricted Subsidiary as a result of the sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other
disposition;

(3)   if the Parent Guarantor designates any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor to be an
Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture;

(4)   in connection with certain enforcement actions taken by the creditors under certain of our
secured Indebtedness in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement as described under the
caption “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(5)   upon release of the guarantee of Indebtedness that resulted in the creation of the Note
Guarantee under the covenant described under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Additional
_Guarantees;”_

(6)   upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture as
described under the captions “—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” and
“—Satisfaction and Discharge;”

(7)   upon the full and final payment of the Notes and performance of all Obligations of the Issuer
and the Guarantors under the Indenture and the Notes;

(8)   as described under the caption “—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver;”

(9)   as a result of a transaction permitted by the covenant described under the caption “—Certain
_Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets;” or_

(10)  otherwise in accordance with the terms of the Indenture.

Upon any occurrence giving rise to a termination and release of a Note Guarantee, as specified
above, the Trustee, subject to receipt of certain documents from the Issuer and/or Guarantor and at
the request and cost of the Issuer, will promptly execute any documents reasonably required in order
to evidence or effect such release, discharge and termination in respect of such Note Guarantee.

The Issuer, the Guarantors and the Trustee will not be required to make a notation on the Notes to
reflect any Guarantee release, discharge or termination.

**Security**

**_General_**
On the Issue Date, the Notes will be secured on a first-ranking basis by the Escrow Charge (which
will be released on the Escrow Release Date or the Special Mandatory Redemption Date, as
applicable).


-----

On the Completion Date and upon the release of the proceeds of the Offering from the Escrow
Account, the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be secured on a first-ranking basis by:

(a)   a pledge over all of the issued shares in the Parent Guarantor, and pledge over intercompany
loan agreements between MEIF 5 Arena Ventures S.à r.l. (“Holdco”) and the Parent Guarantor;

(b)   a pledge over bank accounts of the Parent Guarantor, a pledge over all of the issued shares in
Bidco; and a pledge over intercompany loan agreements between Parent Guarantor and Bidco;

(c)   a pledge over bank accounts of the Issuer, and a pledge over intercompany loan agreements
made to Bidco (including the Proceeds Loans); and

(d)   provided Bidco has been converted into a sociedad anónima by the Completion Date, a pledge
over bank accounts of Bidco; a pledge over all of the issued shares in the Issuer, a pledge over
intercompany loan agreements between Bidco and Empark, and a pledge over Bidco’s rights
under the Acquisition Agreement (and if Bidco has not been converted into a sociedad anónima
by the Completion Date, the security in this clause (d) will be provided within five Business
Days of conversion),

collectively, the “Completion Date Collateral”.

Within two Business Days of the Completion Date, the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be
secured on a first-ranking basis by all of the issued and outstanding shares of Empark provided Bidco
has been converted into a sociedad anónima on or before the Completion Date (and, if Bidco has not
been converted into a sociedad anónima by the Completion Date, the security in this paragraph will
be provided within five Business Days of conversion). Within 90 days of the Completion Date, the
Notes and the Note Guarantees will be secured on a first-ranking basis by:

(a)   security over:

(i)    all the issued and outstanding shares of Dornier;

(ii)   all the issued and outstanding shares of Infraestructuras;

(iii)   all the issued and outstanding shares of Emparque;

(iv)   24.5% of the issued and outstanding shares of Sociedad Municipal de Aparcamientos y
Servicios, S.A.; and

(v)   43.0% of the issued and outstanding shares of Estacionamientos Urbanos de Leon,
S.A.,

(b)   an account pledge covering certain bank accounts of Empark and Dornier; and

(c)   a pledge over all the credit rights under certain of Empark and Dornier’s Spanish off-street
concessions (which include the rights to receive compensation, payments and owed amounts
under the concession agreements),

collectively, the “Post-Completion Date Collateral” and together with the Completion Date Collateral,
the “Collateral”).

The Collateral will also secure on substantially the same basis (but without the quantitative limit (other
than the Collateral securing the issued and outstanding shares of Emparque) and financial assistance
limitations applicable to the Notes) the liabilities under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and
may secure on substantially the same basis (but without the quantitative limit (other than the
Collateral securing the issued and outstanding shares of Emparque) and financial assistance
limitations applicable to the Notes) certain Hedging Obligations, and certain other future indebtedness
(including any Additional Notes); provided, that lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement
and counterparties to certain Hedging Obligations will receive proceeds from the enforcement of the
Collateral in priority to holders of the Notes as further described under the caption “Description of
_Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”._

Any proceeds received upon any enforcement over any Collateral, after all such super senior
liabilities have been discharged from such recoveries, will be applied pro rata in payment of all


-----

liabilities in respect of obligations under the Indenture and the Notes and any other Indebtedness of
the Parent Guarantor or its Restricted Subsidiaries permitted to be incurred and secured by the
Collateral on a pari passu basis pursuant to the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. No
appraisals of the Collateral have been made in connection with this offering of the Notes. By its
nature, some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market
value. Accordingly, the Collateral may not be able to be sold in a short period of time, or at all. See
“Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes”. Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the
Security Agent will not be required to accept or act with respect to any Collateral if it is of a type or in
a jurisdiction which the Security Agent determines does not meet or comply with its internal
regulations or policies or with any law or regulation, or which might impose liability on the Security
Agent.

The security over the Collateral will be limited as necessary to recognize certain limitations arising
under or imposed by local law and defenses generally available to providers of Collateral (including
those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance,
corporate purpose or benefit, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting
the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law. In particular, (a)
security over the Collateral granted by Empark, Dornier and Infraestructuras will be limited to the
value of the Debt Repayment Proceeds Loan (which is expected to be approximately €424.0 million)
and will not secure those obligations or liabilities which, if secured, will constitute an infringement of
Spanish financial assistance laws in accordance with Articles 143.2 and 150 of the Spanish
Companies Act and (b) security over the Collateral securing the issued and outstanding shares of
Emparque will be limited to a maximum amount of €40.0 million with respect to the Notes and the
Revolving Credit Facility, which represents part of the value of the Debt Repayment Proceeds Loan.
For a brief description of such limitations, see “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes—Certain of
_the Note Guarantees will be limited to a specified amount, and each Note Guarantee will be subject_
_to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain_
_defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability” and “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of_
_the Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”._

**_Security and Guarantee Documents_**
The Collateral Documents will directly secure the payment and performance when due of the
obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Indenture and the Notes, the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement and certain other future indebtedness as provided for in the Collateral Documents.

In the event that the Parent Guarantor or its Subsidiaries enter into insolvency, bankruptcy or similar
proceedings, the Security Interests (as defined below) created under the Security and Guarantee
Documents or the rights and obligations set out in the Intercreditor Agreement could be subject to
potential challenges. If any challenge to the validity of the Security Interests created under the
Security and Guarantee Documents or the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement were to be
successful, the Trustee and the holders of the Notes may not be able to recover any amounts under
the Security and Guarantee Documents. See the section entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the
_Notes”._

Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenant described under the caption
_“—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest”, the Issuer and the Guarantors are permitted_
to pledge the Collateral in connection with future incurrences of Indebtedness, including any
Additional Notes, or Indebtedness of its Restricted Subsidiaries, in each case permitted under the
Indenture and on terms consistent with the relative priority of such Indebtedness.

**_Priority_**
The relative priority among (a) the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the
counterparties to certain of the Hedging Obligations secured by the Collateral, (b) the Security Agent,
the Trustee and agent under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement with respect to the security
interests in the Collateral (the “Security Interests”); (c) the Noteholders with respect to the Security
Interests; and (d) certain other holders of Indebtedness from time to time secured by the Collateral is
established by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Indenture, the Security and Guarantee
Documents, and may be set forth in any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and any other security
documents creating security interests in the Collateral.


-----

See the caption “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”. Pursuant
to the Indenture, Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreements entered into after the
Completion Date, the Collateral may be pledged to secure other Indebtedness. See the caption
_“—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest”._

**_Release_**
The Issuer and the Guarantors will be entitled to the release of the Liens over the property and other
assets constituting Collateral securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees under any one or more of
the following circumstances:

(1)   in connection with any sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition or exchange
of such property or assets to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such
transaction) the Parent Guarantor or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, if the sale assignment,
transfer, conveyance or other disposition or exchange does not violate the “Asset Sale”
provisions of the Indenture;

(2)   in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Note Guarantee pursuant to the terms of
the Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Guarantor;

Subsidiary in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture, the release of the
property and assets of such Restricted Subsidiary;

(4)   upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture as
provided under the captions “—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” and
“—Satisfaction and discharge;”

(5)   in connection with certain enforcement actions taken by the creditors under certain of our
Indebtedness in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement as described under the caption
“—Intercreditor Agreement;”

(6)   upon the full and final payment of the Notes and performance of all Obligations of the Issuer
and the Guarantors under the Indenture and the Notes;

(7)   as described under the captions “—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver” and “—Certain
_Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest;”_

(8)   upon release of the Lien that resulted in the creation of the Lien under the covenant described
under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Liens;”

(9)   as a result of a transaction permitted by the covenant described under the caption “—Certain
_Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets”; provided that, in case of the Parent_
Guarantor, the Capital Stock of the Person formed by or surviving any such transaction
becomes part of the Collateral;

(10)  with respect to the Escrow Charge, in accordance with the caption entitled “–Escrow of
_Proceeds; Special Mandatory Remdeption”; or_

(11)  otherwise in accordance with the terms of the Indenture.

At the reasonable request and cost of the Issuer, the Security Agent and the Trustee, if applicable,
will as soon as reasonably practicable take all necessary action required to effectuate any release of
Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees, in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture
and the relevant Collateral Document or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Security Agent without the
consent of the holders of the Notes or any action on the part of the Trustee.

**Security Agent**
The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch will act as Security Agent under the Security and
Guarantee Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement until such time, if any, that a new Security
Agent is appointed under the relevant provisions of the Security and Guarantee Documents and/or
the Intercreditor Agreement and/or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.


-----

Neither the Trustee nor the Security Agent nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees,
attorneys or agents will be responsible or liable for the existence, genuineness, value or protection of
any property securing the Notes or any Notes Guarantee, for the legality, enforceability, effectiveness
or sufficiency of the Collateral, for the creation, perfection, priority, sufficiency or protection of any
Lien, or for any defect or deficiency as to any such matters, or for any failure to demand, collect,
foreclose or realize upon or otherwise enforce any of the Liens or the Security and Guarantee
Documents or any delay in doing so.

**Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption**
Concurrently with the closing of the offering of the Notes on the Issue Date, the Issuer will enter into
an Escrow Agreement with the Trustee and the Escrow Agent, pursuant to which the Issuer will
instruct the initial purchasers to deposit with the Escrow Agent an amount in cash equal to the gross
proceeds of the offering of the Notes sold on the Issue Date into the Escrow Account. The initial
funds deposited in the Escrow Account, and all other funds, securities, interest, dividends, and other
distributions and payments thereon credited to the Escrow Account, are referred to, collectively, as
the “Escrowed Funds”. The Escrow Account is opened in the name of the Escrow Agent for the
benefit of the Issuer and the Issuer will grant the Trustee, for the benefit of itself and the holders of
the Notes, a first priority security interest in the Escrow Account, pursuant to an escrow charge dated
the Issue Date between the Issuer and the Trustee (the “Escrow Charge”).

The Issuer will only be entitled to direct the Escrow Agent to release the Escrowed Funds in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. Pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow
Agent will release the Escrowed Funds (the “Release”) to, or at the order of, the Issuer (the date of
such release being referred to as the “Escrow Release Date”) upon delivery by the Issuer to the
Escrow Agent and the Trustee of an Officer’s Certificate and payment instruction addressed to the
Escrow Agent and the Trustee on or prior to December 31, 2017 (the “Longstop Date”), upon which
both the Escrow Agent and the Trustee may rely, without further investigation, certifying that the
following conditions have been made or will be satisfied following the Release on the Escrow Release
Date:

(1)   the Acquisition will be completed promptly following the Escrow Release Date in accordance
with the terms of the Acquisition Agreement, except for any changes, waivers or other
modifications that will not, individually or when taken as a whole, have a material adverse
effect on the holders of the Notes;

(2)   immediately after consummation of the Acquisition, Bidco will own all of the outstanding Capital
Stock of Empark; and

(3)   as of the delivery date of such Officer’s Certificate, there is no Default or Event of Default
under clause (8) of the first paragraph under the caption “Events of Default and Remedies”
below with respect to the Parent Guarantor, Bidco and the Issuer.

In the event that (a) the Completion Date does not take place on or prior to the Longstop Date or
(b) the Issuer certifies to the Trustee, the Paying Agent and the Escrow Agent that the Acquisition
Agreement has been terminated, or that, in the judgment of the Issuer, the Acquisition will not be
consummated by the Longstop Date, (c) (i) the Permitted Holders cease to beneficially own and
control a majority of the issued and outstanding Capital Stock of the Parent Guarantor on or prior to
the Escrow Release Date or (ii) the Parent Guarantor ceases to beneficially own and control all of the
issued and outstanding Capital Stock of Bidco or Bidco ceases to beneficially own and control all of
the issued and outstanding Capital Stock of the Issuer, in each case, on or prior to the Escrow
Release Date or (d) an Event of Default arises under clause (8) of the first paragraph under the
caption “Events of Default and Remedies” with respect to the Parent Guarantor, Bidco or the Issuer
on or prior to the Escrow Release Date, (each such event being a “Mandatory Redemption Event”),
the Issuer will redeem all of the Notes (the “Special Mandatory Redemption”) at the Special
Mandatory Redemption Price as defined above, which includes accrued but unpaid interest from the
Issue Date, and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the Special Mandatory Redemption
Date. Notice of the occurrence of a Mandatory Redemption Event will be given by the Issuer (a
“Special Redemption Notice”) within three Business Days following the occurrence of a Mandatory
Redemption Event, to the Trustee, the Paying Agent (with an instruction to the Paying Agent to
deliver the same to each Holder of the Notes) and the Escrow Agent. Within three Business Days


-----

after the Issuer sends such notice of a Mandatory Redemption Event, the Issuer will perform the
Special Mandatory Redemption (the date of such redemption, the “Special Mandatory Redemption
_Date”). The Issuer will not be required to make a Special Mandatory Redemption following the_
Release.

Receipt by the Trustee of either an Officer’s Certificate for the release or a notice of Special
Mandatory Redemption (provided funds sufficient to pay the Special Mandatory Redemption Price are
in the Escrow Account) shall constitute deemed consent by the Trustee for the release of the
Escrowed Funds from the Escrow Charge.

On the Business Day prior to the Special Mandatory Redemption Date, the Escrow Agent shall apply
funds standing to the credit of the Escrow Account to make a transfer from the Escrow Account to the
Paying Agent for payment to each Holder of the Special Mandatory Redemption Price for such
Holder’s Notes and, concurrently with the payment to such Holders, deliver the excess Escrowed
Funds (if any) after payment of any fees and expenses of the Escrow Agent and Trustee to the
Issuer.

In the event that the Special Mandatory Redemption Price payable upon such Special Mandatory
Redemption exceeds the amount of the Escrowed Funds, one or more of the Permitted Holders will
be required to fund the accrued and unpaid interest, and Additional Amounts, if any, owing to the
holders of the Notes, pursuant to an agreement between the Issuer and the Permitted Holders. See
“Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Escrow Account—The Notes may be subject to a special
_mandatory redemption, and, as a result, you may not obtain the return you expect on the Notes”._

No provisions of the Escrow Agreement (including those relating to the release of the Escrowed
Funds) may be waived or modified in any manner materially adverse to the Holders without the
consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes outstanding; provided that no
such amendment, waiver or modification shall reduce the Special Mandatory Redemption Price
without the consent of each affected Holder.

If at the time of such Special Mandatory Redemption, the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer will notify the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange that the Special Mandatory Redemption has occurred and any relevant
details relating to such Special Mandatory Redemption.

2018 ................................................................................................................................      101.000
2019 and thereafter..........................................................................................................      100.000

At any time prior to, 2018, either the Issuer or the Parent Guarantor may on any one or more
occasions redeem all or a part of the Floating Rate Notes upon not less than 10 nor more than
60 days’ notice, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Floating Rate
Notes redeemed, plus the Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and unpaid interest and Additional
Amounts, if any, to the date of redemption, subject to the rights of holders of the Floating Rate Notes
on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date.

**_General_**
Any redemption and notice under any provision of this “—Optional Redemption” may, in the Issuer’s
or Parent Guarantor’s discretion (as the case may be), be subject to the satisfaction of one or more
conditions precedent. If such redemption or notice is subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions
precedent, such notice shall state that, in the Issuer’s or Parent Guarantor’s discretion, the
redemption date may be delayed until such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied
(provided, however, that in any case such redemption date shall be no more than 60 days from the
date on which such notice is first given), or such redemption may not occur and such notice may be
rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied or wavied by the
redemption date, or by the redemption date so delayed. In addition, the Issuer or Parent Guarantor
may provide in such notice that payment of the redemption price and performance of the Issuer’s
obligations with respect to such redemption may be performed by another Person.


-----

**Post-Tender Redemption**
In connection with any tender offer for the Fixed Rate Notes or the Floating Rate Notes, if Holders of
Notes of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the applicable outstanding Notes validly
tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer, or any third party making
such a tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn
by such Holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right upon not less than 10 nor more than
60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such tender offer expiration date, to
redeem the applicable Notes that remain outstanding in whole, but not in part, following such
purchase, at a price equal to the price offered to each other Holder of Notes in such tender offer,
plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest, if any,
thereon, to, but excluding such redemption date.

**Redemption for Changes in Taxes**
Either the Issuer or a Guarantor may redeem the Notes, in whole but not in part, at its discretion at
any time upon giving not less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice to the holders of the Notes
(which notice will be irrevocable and given in accordance with the procedures described under the
caption “—Selection and Notice”), at a redemption price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal
amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed by the Issuer for
redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) and all Additional Amounts (if any) then due and which will
become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise (subject to the
right of holders of the Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant
interest payment date and Additional Amounts (if any) in respect thereof), if on the next date on which
any amount would be payable in respect of the Notes or any Note Guarantee, the Issuer or the
relevant Guarantor is or would be required to pay Additional Amounts, and the Issuer or the relevant
Guarantor cannot avoid any such payment obligation by taking reasonable measures available (but,
in the case of the relevant Guarantor, only if such amount cannot be paid to the Issuer or another
Guarantor who can pay such amount without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts where this
would be reasonable), and the requirement arises as a result of:

(1)   any amendment to, or change in, the laws (or any regulations or rulings promulgated
thereunder) or relevant treaties of a relevant Tax Jurisdiction which change or amendment is
publicly announced and becomes effective on or after the Issue Date (or, if the applicable Tax
Jurisdiction became a Tax Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date, such later date); or

(2)   any amendment to, or change in, an official written interpretation or position regarding the
application or administration of such laws, treaties, regulations or rulings (including by virtue of
a holding, judgment, order by a court of competent jurisdiction or a change in published
administrative practice) which amendment or change is announced and becomes effective on
or after the Issue Date (or, if the applicable Tax Jurisdiction became a Tax Jurisdiction on a
date after the Issue Date, such later date) (each of the foregoing clauses (1) and (2), a
“Change in Tax Law”).

The Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will not give any such notice of redemption earlier than 90 days
prior to the earliest date on which the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as applicable, would be
obligated to make such payment or withholding if a payment in respect of the Notes or any Note
Guarantee was then due, and the obligation to pay Additional Amounts must be in effect (or be
scheduled to come into effect on or prior to the next date on which any amount would be payable
under or in respect of the Notes or any Note Guarantee) at the time such notice is given. Prior to the
publication or, where relevant, mailing of any notice of redemption of the Notes pursuant to the
foregoing, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that obligation to pay
such Additional Amounts cannot be avoided by the Issuer or a Guarantor (as the case may be) taking
reasonable measures available to it (but in the case of a Guarantor, only if the payment giving rise to
such requirement cannot be made by the Issuer or another Guarantor without the obligation to pay
Additional Amounts where this would be reasonable); and (b) a written opinion of independent tax
counsel to the Issuer or a Guarantor (as the case may be) of recognized standing qualified under the
laws of the relevant Tax Jurisdiction to the effect that the Issuer or such Guarantor has or will become
obligated to pay such Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law.


-----

The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely on such Officer’s Certificate and opinion of
counsel as sufficient evidence of the existence and satisfaction of the conditions precedent as
described above, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the holders of the Notes.

The foregoing will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor Person to the
Issuer, applicable, is incorporated or organized, engaged in business or resident for Tax purposes or
any jurisdiction from or through which any payment on the Notes is made by or on behalf of such
Person and any political subdivision thereof or therein.

**General**
The Parent Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries may repurchase Notes at any time and from
time to time in the open market or otherwise.

Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under the caption “—Selection and Notice.”

If the Parent Guarantor or the Issuer effects an optional redemption of Notes, it will, so long as the
Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted for trading on
the Euro MTF market and its rules so require, the Issuer will publish notices of an optional
redemption on the website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu).

Unless the Parent Guarantor or the Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest
will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions thereof called for redemption on the applicable
redemption date. If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or
before the related interest payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in
whose name the Note is registered at the close of business on such record date, and no additional
interest will be payable to holders whose Notes will be subject to redemption by the Parent Guarantor
or the Issuer.

**Mandatory Redemption and Sinking Fund**
Other than in connection with a Special Mandatory Redemption, the Issuer is not required to make
mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes.

**Repurchase at the Option of Holders**

**_Change of Control_**
Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, each holder of Notes will have the right to require the
Issuer to repurchase all or any part (in integral multiples of €1,000; provided that Notes of €100,000
or less may only be redeemed in whole and not in part) of that holder’s Notes pursuant to a Change
of Control Offer on the terms set forth in the Indenture. In the Change of Control Offer, the Issuer will
offer a payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes repurchased, plus
accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes repurchased to the date of
purchase (the “Change of Control Payment”), subject to the rights of holders of Notes on the relevant
record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date. Within 60 days following
any Change of Control, the Issuer will mail a notice to each holder of the Notes at such holder’s
registered address or otherwise deliver a notice in accordance with the procedures described under
the caption “—Selection and Notice,” stating that a Change of Control Offer is being made and
offering to repurchase Notes on the date (the “Change of Control Payment Date”) specified in the
notice, which date will be no earlier than 10 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice
is mailed or delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the Indenture and described in such
notice.

The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-l under the US Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the “US Exchange Act”) and any other applicable securities laws and regulations
to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the
Notes as a result of a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws
or regulations conflict with the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply
with any applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its
obligations under the Indenture by virtue of such compliance.


-----

On or prior to the Change of Control Payment Date, Bidco will prepay the Proceeds Loans to the
extent necessary to finance the repurchase by the Issuer of any Notes tendered pursuant to the
Change of Control Offer.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful:

(1)   accept for payment all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of
Control Offer;

(2)   deposit with the paying agent or tender agent for such Change of Control Offer an amount
equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions of Notes properly
tendered; and

(3)   deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Notes properly accepted together with an
Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions of Notes being
purchased by the Issuer.

The Paying Agent or tender agent for such Change of Control Offer will promptly mail (or cause to be
delivered) to each holder of Notes properly tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes,
and the Trustee (or an authentication agent approved by it) will promptly authenticate and mail (or
cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each holder a new Note equal in principal amount to any
unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any. The Issuer will publicly announce the results of
the Change of Control Offer on or as soon as practicable after the Change of Control Payment Date.

If Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender
and do not withdraw such Notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Issuer, or any third party
making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered
and not withdrawn by such holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right, upon not less
than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such purchase
pursuant to such Change of Control Offer, to redeem all Notes that remain outstanding following such
purchase at a price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid
interest to but excluding the date of such redemption (subject to the right of Holders of record on the
relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

The provisions described above that require the Issuer to make a Change of Control Offer following a
Change of Control will be applicable whether or not any other provisions of the Indenture are
applicable. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not
contain provisions that permit the holders of the Notes to require that the Issuer repurchase or
redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction.

The ability of the Issuer to repurchase Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by
a number of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that constitute a Change of Control
would constitute a mandatory prepayment event and/or a default due to a breach of undertaking
under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. The future Indebtedness of the Parent Guarantor and
its Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a Change of
Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the
exercise by the holders of the Notes of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could
cause a default under such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the
financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. Finally, the ability of the Issuer to pay cash to the
holders of the Notes upon a repurchase may be limited by its then existing financial resources. There
can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required
repurchases.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if (1) a
third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in
compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer
made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under the Change
of Control Offer, or (2) a notice of redemption has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described
under the caption “—Optional Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in payment of the
applicable redemption price. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of
Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation


-----

of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time
the Change of Control Offer is made.

The definition of Change of Control includes a phrase relating to the direct or indirect sale, lease,
transfer, conveyance or other disposition of “all or substantially all” of the properties or assets of the
Parent Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is a limited body of
case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the
phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of Notes to require the Issuer to
repurchase its Notes as a result of a sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of less
than all of the assets of the Parent Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to
another Person or group may be uncertain.

The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase
the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the consent of the
holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes prior to the occurrence of the Change of
Control.

For so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and
admitted for trading on the Euro MTF market and its rules so require, the Issuer will publish notices
relating to the Change of Control Offer on the website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange
(www.bourse.lu).

The Issuer or the Parent Guarantor (as the case may be) will comply with the requirements of Rule
14e-l under the US Exchange Act and any other applicable securities laws and regulations to the
extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with each repurchase of Notes
pursuant to a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or
regulations conflict with the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer or the Parent
Guarantor will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to
have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of
such compliance.

**Selection and Notice**
If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Paying Agent (or the Registrar, as
appropriate) will select Notes for redemption on a pro rata basis (or, in the case of Notes issued in
global form, in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and as
discussed under the caption “Book-Entry; Delivery and Form”), unless otherwise required by law or
applicable stock exchange or depository requirements. None of the Trustee, the Paying Agent or the
Registrar shall be liable for any selections made by it in accordance with this paragraph.

No Notes of €100,000 or less can be redeemed in part. Notices of redemption will be mailed by first
class mail at least 10 but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of Notes
to be redeemed at its registered address, except that redemption notices may be mailed more than
60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the
Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture.

If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note will state
the portion of the principal amount of that Note that is to be redeemed. A new Note in principal
amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the original Note will be issued in the name of the holder
of Notes upon cancellation of the original Note. Notes called for redemption become due on the date
fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or
portions of Notes called for redemption.

For Notes which are represented by global certificates held on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream,
notices may be given by delivery of the relevant notices to Euroclear or Clearstream for
communication to entitled account holders in substitution for the aforesaid mailing.

In addition, so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange
and admitted for trading on the Euro MTF market and its rules so require, the Issuer will publish
notices (including with respect to optional redemptions, repurchases at the option of the holders or
any exchange offer) on the website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu) and will


-----

inform the Luxembourg Stock Exchange of the outstanding aggregate principal amounts of each
series of the Notes then in issue.

**Certain Covenants**

**_Restricted Payments_**
The Parent Guarantor will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to,
directly or indirectly:

(1)   declare or pay any dividend or make any other payment or other distribution on account of the
Parent Guarantor’s or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries’ Equity Interests (including, without
limitation, any payment in connection with any merger or consolidation involving the Parent
Guarantor or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) or to the direct or indirect holders of the Parent
Guarantor’s or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries’ Equity Interests in their capacity as holders
(other than dividends or distributions payable in Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock)
of the Parent Guarantor and other than dividends or distributions payable to the Parent
Guarantor or a Restricted Subsidiary);

acquire or retire for value any Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor that is expressly
contractually subordinated in right of payment or in right of security to the Notes or to any Note
Guarantee (excluding any intercompany Indebtedness between or among the Parent
Guarantor and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries), except (i) a payment of interest or principal
at the Stated Maturity thereof or (ii) the payment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance or other
acquisition of Indebtedness purchased in anticipation of satisfying a sinking fund obligation,
principal installment or scheduled maturity, in each case due within one year of the date of
such payment, purchase, repurchase or other acquisition;

(4)   make any payment on or with respect to, or purchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or
retire for value any Subordinated Shareholder Debt (other than any payment of interest thereon
in the form of additional Subordinated Shareholder Debt); or

(5)   make any Restricted Investment,

(all such payments and other actions set forth in these clauses (1) through (5) above being
collectively referred to as “Restricted Payments”), unless, at the time of any such Restricted Payment:

(a)   no Default has occurred and is continuing or would immediately occur as a consequence
of such Restricted Payment;

(b)   the Parent Guarantor would, at the time of such Restricted Payment and after giving pro
_forma effect thereto as if such Restricted Payment had been made at the beginning of_
the applicable four-quarter period, have been permitted to incur at least €1.00 of
additional Indebtedness pursuant to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test set forth in
clause (1) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under the caption
“—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock;” and

(c)   such Restricted Payment, together with the aggregate amount of all other Restricted
Payments made by the Parent Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries since the Issue
Date (excluding Restricted Payments permitted by clauses (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8),
(9), (10), (11), (12), (15) and (19) of the next succeeding paragraph), is less than the
sum, without duplication, of:

(i)    50% of the Consolidated Net Income of the Parent Guarantor for the period (taken
as one accounting period) from the beginning of the fiscal quarter commencing
immediately prior to the Completion Date to the end of the Parent Guarantor’s
most recently ended fiscal quarter for which internal financial statements are


-----

available at the time of such Restricted Payment (or, if such Consolidated Net
Income for such period is a deficit, less 100% of such deficit); plus

(ii)   100% of the aggregate net cash proceeds and the Fair Market Value of property
or assets or marketable securities received by the Parent Guarantor since the

a contribution to its common equity capital or from the issue or sale of Equity
Interests of the Parent Guarantor (other than Disqualified Stock and Excluded
Contributions) or from the issue or sale of convertible or exchangeable
Disqualified Stock of the Parent Guarantor or convertible or exchangeable debt
securities of the Parent Guarantor, in each case that have been converted into or
exchanged for Equity Interests of the Parent Guarantor (other than Equity
Interests (or Disqualified Stock or debt securities) sold to a Subsidiary of the
Parent Guarantor) or from the issuance or sale of Subordinated Shareholder Debt
(other than an issuance or sale to a Subsidiary of the Parent Guarantor); plus

(iii)   to the extent that any Restricted Investment constituting a Restricted Payment that
was made after the Issue Date is (a) sold, disposed of or otherwise cancelled,
liquidated or repaid, 100% of the aggregate amount received in cash and the Fair
Market Value of the property or assets or the marketable securities received by
the Parent Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than a disposition to the
Parent Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary), or (b) made in an entity that
subsequently becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, 100% of the Fair Market Value of
the Restricted Investment of the Parent Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries
as of the date such entity becomes a Restricted Subsidiary; plus

(iv)   to the extent that any Unrestricted Subsidiary of the Parent Guarantor designated
as such after the Issue Date is redesignated as a Restricted Subsidiary or is
merged or consolidated into the Parent Guarantor or a Restricted Subsidiary, or all
of the assets of such Unrestricted Subsidiary are transferred to the Parent
Guarantor or a Restricted Subsidiary, the Fair Market Value of the property
received by the Parent Guarantor or Restricted Subsidiary or the Parent
Guarantor’s Restricted Investment in such Subsidiary as of the date of such
redesignation, merger, consolidation or transfer of assets, to the extent such
investments reduced the restricted payments capacity under this clause (c) and
were not previously repaid or otherwise reduced; plus

(v)   100% of any dividends or distributions received by the Parent Guarantor or a
Restricted Subsidiary after the Issue Date from an Unrestricted Subsidiary or a
Permitted Joint Venture, to the extent that such dividends or distributions were not
otherwise included in the Consolidated Net Income of the Parent Guarantor for
such period; plus

(vi)   upon the full and unconditional release of a Restricted Investment constituting a
Restricted Payment that is a guarantee made by the Parent Guarantor or one of
its Restricted Subsidiaries to any Person, an amount equal to the amount of such
guarantee,

_provided, that notwithstanding the foregoing, any amounts (such amounts, the “Excluded Amounts”)_
that would otherwise be included in the calculation of the amount available for Restricted Payments
pursuant to the preceding clause (c) will be excluded to the extent (1) such amounts result from the
receipt of net cash proceeds or property or assets or marketable securities received in contemplation
of, or in connection with, an event that would otherwise constitute a Change of Control pursuant to
the definition thereof, (2) the purpose of, or the effect of, the receipt of such net cash proceeds or
property or assets or marketable securities was to reduce the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio so
that there would be an occurrence of a Specified Change of Control Event that would not have been
achieved without the receipt of such net cash proceeds or property or assets or marketable securities
and (3) no Change of Control Offer is made in connection with such Change of Control in accordance
with the requirements of the Indenture.


-----

The preceding provisions will not prohibit:

(1)   the payment of any dividend or the consummation of any redemption within 60 days after the
date of declaration of the dividend or giving of the redemption notice, as the case may be, if at
the date of declaration or notice, the dividend or redemption payment would have complied
with the provisions of the Indenture;

(2)   the making of any Restricted Payment in exchange for, or out of or with the net cash proceeds
of the sale or issuance (other than to a Subsidiary of the Parent Guarantor) of, Equity Interests

a Parent Debt Contribution or Excluded Amounts), Subordinated Shareholder Debt or from the
contribution of common equity capital to the Parent Guarantor (other than through the issuance
of Disqualified Stock or through an Excluded Contribution or a Parent Debt Contribution or
Excluded Amounts) within 30 days of such Restricted Payment, excluding the Equity
Contribution; provided that the amount of any such net cash proceeds that are utilized for any
such Restricted Payment will be excluded from clause (c) (ii) of the preceding paragraph and
will not be considered to be net cash proceeds from an Equity Offering for purposes of the
“Optional Redemption” provisions of the Indenture;

(3)   any purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement of
Subordinated Indebtedness:

(a)   (i) from Net Available Cash to the extent permitted under the caption “—Asset Sales”, but

caption “—Asset Sales” and purchased all Notes tendered pursuant to any offer to
repurchase all the Notes required thereby, prior to purchasing, repurchasing, redeeming,
defeasing or otherwise acquiring or retiring such Subordinated Indebtedness; and (ii) at
a purchase price not greater than 100% of the principal amount of such Subordinated
Indebtedness plus accrued and unpaid interest;

permitted to be incurred pursuant to the covenant under the caption “—Incurrence of
_Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock;”_

portion of the funds utilized to consummate the transaction or series of related
transactions pursuant to which such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was
otherwise acquired by the Parent Guarantor or a Restricted Subsidiary or (B) otherwise
in connection with or contemplation of such acquisition) and (ii) at a purchase price not
greater than 100% of the principal amount of such Subordinated Indebtedness plus

pursuant to any equity subscription agreement, stock option agreement, restricted stock grant,
shareholders’ agreement or similar agreement (or the guarantee of any such arrangement by
any of the Parent Guarantor or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries); provided that the aggregate
price paid for all such purchased, repurchased, redeemed, defeased acquired or retired Equity
Interests may not exceed an amount equal to (x) €5.0 million, plus €2.5 million multiplied by the

the Parent Guarantor, plus (z) the cash proceeds of key man life insurance policies to the
extent the cash proceeds in (y) and (z) from the sale of Equity Interests that have not otherwise
been applied to the making of Restricted Payments pursuant to clause (c)(ii) of the preceding

of Indebtedness owing to the Parent Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary from Management
Investors and other members of management, directors, employees or consultants of the
Parent Guarantor, or any Parent Holdco or Restricted Subsidiaries in connection with a
repurchase of Equity Interests of the Parent Guarantor or of a Parent Holdco will not be
deemed to constitute a Restricted Payment for purposes of this covenant or any other
provision of the Indenture;

in any fiscal year the greater of (a) 6% of the net cash proceeds received by the Parent

the Parent Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries that are relieved thereby;

(16)  so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (or would immediately

the Restricted Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be transferred or issued by the
Parent Guarantor or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to the Restricted
Payment. Unsecured Indebtedness shall not be deemed to be subordinate or junior to secured
Indebtedness by virtue of its nature as unsecured Indebtedness.

For the purposes of calculating “Consolidated EBITDA” pro forma effect shall be given to
Consolidated EBITDA on the same basis as for calculating the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio.

**_Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock_**
The Parent Guarantor will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to,
directly or indirectly, create, incur, issue, assume, guarantee or otherwise become directly or indirectly


-----

liable, contingently or otherwise, with respect to (collectively, “incur”) any Indebtedness (including
Acquired Debt), and the Parent Guarantor will not issue any Disqualified Stock and the Parent
Guarantor will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to issue any Disqualified Stock or any
shares of preferred stock; provided, however that the Parent Guarantor may incur Indebtedness
(including Acquired Debt) or issue Disqualified Stock and the Restricted Subsidiaries may incur
Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt) or issue any Disqualified Stock or preferred stock if:

(1)   the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Parent Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries
would have been at least 2.0 to 1.0, determined on a pro forma basis (including a pro forma
application of the net proceeds therefrom), as if the additional Indebtedness had been incurred
or the Disqualified Stock or preferred stock had been issued, as the case may be, at the
beginning of such four quarter period; and

(2)   if the Indebtedness is Senior Secured Indebtedness, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net
Leverage Ratio for the Parent Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been less
than 7.1 to 1.0, determined on a pro forma basis (including a pro forma application of the net
proceeds therefrom), as if the additional Senior Secured Indebtedness had been incurred or
the Disqualified Stock or preferred stock had been issued, as the case may be, on the
Calculation Date (as defined herein).

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the incurrence of any of the following items of
Indebtedness (collectively, “Permitted Debt”):

(1)   the incurrence by the Issuer and the Guarantors of Indebtedness under Credit Facilities
(including in respect of letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances issued or created thereunder),
in an aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding under this clause (1) not to
exceed the greater of €75.0 million and 100.0% of Consolidated EBITDA plus, in the case of

aggregate amount of fees, underwriting discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses
incurred in connection with such refinancing;

this paragraph;

improvement of property (real or personal), plant or equipment or other assets used or useful in
a Permitted Business of the Parent Guarantor or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, whether
through the direct purchase of assets or the Capital Stock of any Person owning such assets,
and any Indebtedness incurred to renew, refund, replace, refinance, defease or discharge any
Indebtedness incurred pursuant to this clause (4) in an aggregate principal amount not to
exceed the greater of €20.0 million and 25.0% of Consolidated EBITDA at any time
outstanding;

(5)   the incurrence by the Parent Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary of Permitted Refinancing

Disqualified Stock and preferred stock (other than intercompany Indebtedness) that was
permitted by the Indenture to be incurred under the first paragraph of this covenant or
clauses (2) (unless such Indebtedness is refinanced pursuant to clause (19) of this paragraph),
(3), (5) or (13) of this paragraph;

(6)   the incurrence by the Parent Guarantor, the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of

Restricted Subsidiary (including any Proceeds Loan or other proceeds loan made by the Issuer
or any other Restricted Subsidiary in respect of Indebtedness incurred by such Person);
_provided that:_

(a)   if the Issuer or any Guarantor is the obligor on such Indebtedness and the payee is not
the Issuer or a Guarantor, such Indebtedness must be unsecured and ((i) except in
respect of the intercompany current liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business
in connection with the cash management operations of the Parent Guarantor and its
Restricted Subsidiaries and (ii) only to the extent legally permitted (the Parent Guarantor
and its Restricted Subsidiaries having completed all procedures required in the
reasonable judgment of directors of officers of the obligee or obligor to protect such
Persons from any penalty or civil or criminal liability in connection with the subordination
of such Indebtedness)) expressly subordinated to the prior payment in full in cash of all
Obligations then due with respect to the Notes, in the case of the Issuer, or the Note
Guarantee, in the case of a Guarantor; and

(b)   (i) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Equity Interests that results in any such
Indebtedness being held by a Person other than the Parent Guarantor or a Restricted
Subsidiary and (ii) any sale or other transfer of any such Indebtedness to a Person that

Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, that was not permitted by this clause (6);

(7)   the issuance by any Restricted Subsidiary to the Parent Guarantor or to any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries of preferred stock; provided that:

stock being held by a Person other than the Parent Guarantor or a Restricted
Subsidiary; and

(b)   any sale or other transfer of any such preferred stock to a Person that is not either the

will be deemed, in each case, to constitute an issuance of such preferred stock by such
Restricted Subsidiary that was not permitted by this clause (7);

(8)   the incurrence by the Parent Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary of Hedging Obligations
not for speculative purposes (as determined in good faith by the Parent Guarantor or such

Parent Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary (excluding any Non-Recourse Restricted
Subsidiary) to the extent that the guaranteed Indebtedness was permitted to be incurred by
another provision of this covenant; provided that if the Indebtedness being guaranteed is
subordinated to or pari passu with the Notes or a Note Guarantee, then the guarantee must be
subordinated or pari passu, as applicable, to the same extent as the Indebtedness guaranteed;
and (b) without limiting the covenant described under the caption “—Liens”, Indebtedness
arising by reason of any Lien granted by or applicable to any Person securing Indebtedness of
the Parent Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary so long as the incurrence of such
Indebtedness is permitted under the terms of the Indenture;

(10)  the incurrence by the Parent Guarantor or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness in
respect of workers’ compensation claims, self-insurance obligations, captive insurance

(11)  (a) the incurrence by the Parent Guarantor or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of

within 30 Business Days, (b) customer deposits and advance payments received in the
ordinary course of business from customers for goods or services purchased in the ordinary

date on which such Indebtedness is incurred;

(12)  Indebtedness represented by guarantees of any Management Advances;

(13)  Indebtedness of (x) the Issuer or any Guarantor used to finance an acquisition or (y) any
Person outstanding on the date on which such Person becomes a Restricted Subsidiary or is

Restricted Subsidiary (other than, in the case of this clause (y), Indebtedness incurred to
provide all or any portion of the funds used to consummate the transaction or series of related

pursuant to clause (1) of the first paragraph of this covenant, after giving effect to the
incurrence of such Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (13) or (b) the Fixed Charge Coverage
Ratio on a pro forma basis would not be less than such ratio was immediately prior to giving
effect to such acquisition or other transaction;

(14)  Indebtedness arising from agreements of the Parent Guarantor or a Restricted Subsidiary
providing for customary guarantees, indemnification, obligations in respect of earnouts or other

or any Equity Interests of a Subsidiary, provided that the maximum liability of the Parent
Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries in respect of all such Indebtedness shall at no time
exceed the gross proceeds, including the Fair Market Value of non-cash proceeds (measured
at the time received and without giving effect to any subsequent changes in value), actually
received by the Parent Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries in connection with such
disposition;

(15)  Indebtedness of the Parent Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries in respect of (A) letters of

stock incurred pursuant to this clause (17), not to exceed the greater of €32.5 million and
40.0% of Consolidated EBITDA at any time outstanding;

(18)  Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor in an aggregate outstanding principal amount
which, when taken together with any Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof
and the principal amount of all other Indebtedness incurred pursuant to this clause (18) and
then outstanding, will not exceed 100% of the net cash proceeds received by the Parent
Guarantor from the issuance or sale (other than to a Restricted Subsidiary) of its Subordinated
Shareholder Debt or Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock or Excluded Contributions or
Excluded Amounts) or otherwise contributed to equity (other than through the issuance of
Disqualified Stock or Excluded Contributions or Excluded Amounts) of the Parent Guarantor, in
each case, subsequent to the Issue Date; provided, however, that (a) any such net cash
proceeds that are so received or contributed shall be excluded for purposes of making
Restricted Payments under the first paragraph and clauses (2), (4) and (13) of the second
paragraph of the covenant described under the caption “—Restricted Payments” to the extent
the Parent Guarantor or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries incur Indebtedness in reliance
thereon and (b) any net proceeds that are so received or contributed shall be excluded for
purposes of incurring Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (18) to the extent the Parent
Guarantor or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries makes a Restricted Payment under the first
paragraph or clauses (2), (4) and (13) of the second paragraph of the covenant described
under the caption“—Restricted Payments” in reliance thereon; and

(19)  the incurrence of Indebtedness by Non-Recourse Restricted Subsidiaries provided that (a) the
proceeds of such Indebtedness shall be used to renew, refund, refinance, replace, exchange,

that was originally incurred under the Revolving Credit Facility (the proceeds of which were
used to refinance Non-Recourse Restricted Subsidiary Project Indebtedness); and (b) the
aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, if applicable), or if issued with original issue
discount, aggregate issue price) of such Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount
(or accreted value, if applicable, or if issued with original issue discount, aggregate issue price)
of the Indebtedness renewed, refunded, refinanced, replaced, exchanged, defeased or
discharged (plus all accrued interest on the Indebtedness and the amount of all fees and
expenses, including premiums, incurred in connection therewith).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Restricted Subsidiaries that are not either the Issuer or a Guarantor
may not incur any Indebtedness under the first paragraph or clauses (1), (4) or (17) of the second
paragraph of this covenant, unless the aggregate principal amount of all such Indebtedness shall not
exceed the greater of €20.0 million and 25.0% of Consolidated EBITDA outstanding at any one time.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant:

(1)   the amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date will be:

(a)   in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount, the lesser of the
accreted value of such Indebtedness and the amount of the liability in respect thereof
determined in accordance with IFRS;

(b)   the principal amount of the Indebtedness, as determined in accordance with IFRS, in the
case of any other Indebtedness; and

(c)   in respect of Indebtedness of another Person secured by a Lien on the assets of the
specified Person, the lesser of:

(i)    the Fair Market Value of such assets at the date of determination; and


-----

(ii)   the amount of the Indebtedness of the other Person, and

(2)   subject to clause (3) below, in the event that an item of Indebtedness meets the criteria of more
than one of the categories of Permitted Debt described in clauses (1) through (19) above, or is
entitled to be incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, the Parent Guarantor, in
its sole discretion, will be permitted to classify such item of Indebtedness on the date of its
incurrence and only be required to include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in one of
such clauses and will be permitted on the date of such incurrence to divide and classify an item
of Indebtedness in more than one of the types of Indebtedness described in the first and
second paragraphs of this covenant, from time to time to reclassify all or a portion of such item
of Indebtedness, in any manner that complies with this covenant;

(3)   any Indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will be deemed to be incurred
in reliance on the exception provided in clause (1) of the definition of Permitted Debt and may
not be reclassified;

(4)   Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other
similar instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the
determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;

(5)   if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments
are incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as incurred pursuant to
clause (1), (4), (17) or (18) of the second paragraph above or the first paragraph above and the
letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness,
then such other Indebtedness shall not be included;

(6)   the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Parent Guarantor or a Restricted
Subsidiary, or Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the
maximum mandatory redemption or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any
redemption or repurchase premium) or the liquidation preference thereof;

(7)   Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one
provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and
in part by one or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness;

(8)   for the purposes of determining “Consolidated EBITDA” (x) pro forma effect shall be given to
Consolidated EBITDA on the same basis as for calculating the Consolidated Net Leverage
Ratio for the Parent Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries; and (y) in relation to clause (1)
of the second paragraph of this covenant, Consolidated EBITDA shall be measured on the
most recent date on which new commitments are obtained (in the case of revolving facilities) or
the date on which new Indebtedness is incurred (in the case of term facilities) and for the
period of the most recent four consecutive fiscal quarters ending prior to such date for which
such internal consolidated financial statements of the Parent Guarantor are available; and

(9)   the incurrence by an Unrestricted Subsidiary of the Parent Guarantor of Non-Recourse Debt
will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness or an issuance of Disqualified Stock
for purposes of this covenant; provided, however, that if any such Indebtedness ceases to be
Non-Recourse Debt of such Unrestricted Subsidiary, such Indebtedness will be deemed to
constitute an incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Parent Guarantor.

The accrual of interest or preferred stock dividends, the accretion or amortization of original issue
discount, the payment of interest on any Indebtedness in the form of additional Indebtedness, the
reclassification of preferred stock as Indebtedness due to a change in accounting principles, and the
payment of dividends on preferred stock or Disqualified Stock in the form of additional shares of the
same class of preferred stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or
obligations not treated as Indebtedness as of the Issue Date (including, without limitation, capital
leases) due to a change in IFRS will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness or an
issuance of preferred stock or Disqualified Stock for purposes of this covenant.

For purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction on the incurrence of
Indebtedness, the euro equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a different
currency shall be utilized, calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the


-----

date such Indebtedness was incurred; provided, however, that (i) if such Indebtedness denominated
in non-euro currency is subject to a Currency Exchange Protection Agreement with respect to euro
the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in euro will be calculated so as to take account of the
effects of such Currency Exchange Protection Agreement; and (ii) the euro equivalent of the principal
amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the
relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date. The principal amount of any refinancing
Indebtedness incurred in the same currency as the Indebtedness being refinanced will be the euro
equivalent of the Indebtedness refinanced determined on the date such Indebtedness was originally
incurred, except that to the extent that:

(1)   such euro equivalent was determined based on a Currency Exchange Protection Agreement, in
which case the refinancing Indebtedness will be determined in accordance with the preceding
sentence; and

(2)   the principal amount of the refinancing Indebtedness exceeds the principal amount of the
Indebtedness being refinanced, in which case the euro equivalent of such excess will be
determined on the date such refinancing Indebtedness is being incurred.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the
Parent Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary may incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be
deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in exchange rates or currency values.

**_Liens_**
The Parent Guarantor will not and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to,
directly or indirectly, create, incur, assume or otherwise cause or suffer to exist or become effective
any Lien of any kind securing Indebtedness upon any of their property or assets, now owned or
hereafter acquired, except (1) in the case of any property or asset that does not constitute Collateral
or the Escrow Charge, (a) Permitted Liens or (b) if such Lien is not a Permitted Lien, to the extent
that the Notes and/or the Note Guarantees are secured on an equal and ratable pari passu basis
with, or prior to, the obligations so secured (provided that if such obligations so secured are
subordinated in right of payment to either the Notes or any Note Guarantee, on a senior priority
basis) until such time as such obligations are no longer secured by a Lien and (2) in the case of any
property or asset that constitutes Collateral, Permitted Collateral Liens.

Any such Lien thereby created in favor of the Notes or any such Guarantee pursuant to the preceding
paragraph will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon (i) the release and
discharge of the initial Lien to which it relates, (ii) in the case of any such Lien in favor of any such
Guarantee, upon the termination and discharge of such Note Guarantee in accordance with the terms
of the Indenture or (iii) any other circumstances set forth under the caption “—Security—Release.”

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, (A) a Lien securing an item of
Indebtedness need not be permitted solely by reference to one category of Permitted Liens described
in the definition of “Permitted Liens” or pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant but may be
permitted in part under any combination thereof and (B) in the event that a Lien securing an item of
Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) meets the criteria of one or more of the categories of Permitted
Liens described in the definition of “Permitted Liens” or pursuant to the first paragraph of this
covenant, the Issuer shall, in its sole discretion, classify or reclassify, or later divide, classify or
reclassify, such Lien securing each item of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) in any manner that
complies with this covenant and will only be required to include the amount and type of such Lien or
such item of Indebtedness secured by such Lien in one of the clauses of the definition of “Permitted
Liens” and such Lien securing such item of Indebtedness will be treated as being incurred or existing
pursuant to only one of such clauses or pursuant to the first paragraph hereof.

**_Asset Sales_**
The Parent Guarantor will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to,
directly or indirectly, consummate an Asset Sale unless:

(1)   the Parent Guarantor (or the Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) receives consideration
at least equal to the Fair Market Value of the assets or Equity Interests issued or sold or
otherwise disposed of; and


-----

(2)   at least 75% of the consideration received in the Asset Sale by the Parent Guarantor or such
Restricted Subsidiary is in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents (including a combination
thereof). For purposes of this provision, each of the following will be deemed to be cash:

(a)   any liabilities, as recorded on the balance sheet (or the notes thereto) of the Parent
Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than contingent liabilities), that are
assumed by the transferee of any such assets and as a result of which the Parent
Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries are no longer obligated with respect to such
liabilities or are indemnified against further liabilities;

(b)   any securities, notes or other obligations received by the Parent Guarantor or any such
Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted by the Parent Guarantor
or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents within 180 days following
the closing of the Asset Sale, to the extent of the cash or Cash Equivalents received in
that conversion;

(c)   any Capital Stock or assets of the kind referred to in clauses (3) or (5) of the next
paragraph of this covenant;

(d)   Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a
result of such Asset Sale, to the extent that the Parent Guarantor and each other
Restricted Subsidiary are released from any guarantee of such Indebtedness in
connection with such Asset Sale;

(e)   consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor received from
Persons who are not the Parent Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary that is
cancelled;

(f)    any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Parent Guarantor or any

and 15.0% of Consolidated EBITDA at the time of the receipt of such Designated NonCash Consideration (with the Fair Market Value of each item of Designated Non-Cash
Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to
subsequent changes in value); and

(g)   Replacement Assets.

Within 365 days after the receipt of any Net Available Cash from an Asset Sale, the Parent Guarantor
(or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) may apply such Net Available Cash (at
the option of the Parent Guarantor or Restricted Subsidiary):

(1)   (i) prepay, repay, purchase or redeem any Indebtedness incurred under clause (1) of the
second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness and
_Issuance of Preferred Stock”; provided, however, that, in connection with any prepayment,_
repayment, purchase or redemption of Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (1), the Parent
Guarantor or such Restricted Subsidiary will retire such Indebtedness and will cause the
related commitment (if any) to be permanently reduced in an amount equal to the principal
amount so prepaid, repaid, purchase or redeemed; (ii) unless included in the preceding clause
(1)(i), prepay, repay, purchase or redeem Notes at a price equal to at least 100% of the
principal amount of the Notes or other Indebtedness that is not subordinated in right of
payment to the Notes and that is secured by security over the Collateral that ranks equal to
security over the Collateral securing the Notes at a price of no more than 100% of the principal
amount of such applicable Indebtedness, plus in each case accrued and unpaid interest to the
date of such prepayment, repayment, purchase or redemption; or (iii) prepay, repay, purchase
or redeem any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor or any
Indebtedness that is secured by Liens on assets which do not constitute Collateral (in each
case other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor or Indebtedness owed
to the Parent Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary); provided that the Parent Guarantor or
Restricted Subsidiary shall prepay, repay, purchase or redeem Indebtedness (other than the
Notes) pursuant to sub-clause (ii) or (iii) only if the Issuer makes (at such time or in compliance


-----

with this covenant) an offer to Holders to purchase their Notes in accordance with the
provisions set forth below for an Asset Sale Offer for an aggregate principal amount of Notes
equal to the proportion that (x) the total aggregate principal amount of Notes outstanding bears
to (y) the sum total aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding plus the total
aggregate principal amount outstanding of such Indebtedness (other than the Notes);

(2)   (i) purchase Notes pursuant to an offer to all Holders of the Notes at a purchase price in cash
equal to at least 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and
Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of
Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest
payment date) or (ii) redeem the Notes pursuant to the redemption provisions of the Indenture;

(3)   to acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or any Capital Stock of, another Permitted
Business, if, after giving effect to any such acquisition of Capital Stock, the Permitted Business
is or becomes a Restricted Subsidiary;

(4)   to make a capital expenditure or invest in any Replacement Assets;

(5)   to acquire other assets (other than Capital Stock) not classified as current assets under IFRS
that are used, useful in or related to a Permitted Business;

(6)   consummate any combination of the foregoing; or

(7)   enter into a binding commitment to apply the Net Available Cash pursuant to clause (1), (2),
(3), (4), (5) or (6) of this paragraph; provided that such binding commitment shall be treated as
a permitted application of the Net Available Cash from the date of such commitment until the
earlier of (x) the date on which such acquisition or expenditure is consummated, and (y) the
180th day following the expiration of the aforementioned 365 day period.

Pending the final application of any Net Available Cash, the Parent Guarantor (or the applicable
Restricted Subsidiary) may temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise invest the Net
Available Cash in any manner that is not prohibited by the Indenture. The Parent Guarantor (or the
applicable Restricted Subsidiary) may elect to invest pursuant to clauses (3), (4) or (5) of the above
paragraph prior to receiving the Net Available Cash provided that such investment will be made no
earlier than the execution of a definitive agreement for the relevant Asset Sale.

Any Net Available Cash from Asset Sales that are not applied or invested as provided in the second
paragraph of this covenant will constitute “Excess Proceeds.” When the aggregate amount of Excess
Proceeds exceeds €22.5 million, within ten Business Days thereof, either the Issuer or the Parent
Guarantor will make an offer (an “Asset Sale Offer”) to all holders of Notes and may make an offer to
all holders of other Indebtedness that is pari passu with the Notes or any Note Guarantees and
secured by security over the Collateral that ranks equal to the security over the Collateral securing
the Notes to purchase, prepay or redeem with the proceeds of sales of assets to purchase, prepay or
redeem the maximum principal amount of Notes and such other pari passu Indebtedness (plus all
accrued interest on the Indebtedness and the amount of all fees and expenses, including premiums,
incurred in connection therewith) that may be purchased, prepaid or redeemed out of the Excess
Proceeds and Bidco will prepay the Proceeds Loans to the extent necessary to finance the
repurchase of the Notes by the Issuer. The offer price for the Notes in any Asset Sale Offer will be
equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if
any, to the date of purchase, prepayment or redemption, subject to the rights of holders of Notes on
the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date, and will be
payable in cash. If any Excess Proceeds remain after an Asset Sale Offer, the Parent Guarantor and
its Restricted Subsidiaries may use those remaining Excess Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise
prohibited by the Indenture (including to fund (to the extent consistent with any other applicable
provision of the Indenture) any general corporate purpose (including but not limited to the repurchase,
repayment or other acquisition or retirement of any Subordinated Indebtedness or the making of
Restricted Payments)). If the aggregate principal amount of Notes and other pari passu Indebtedness
tendered into (or to be prepaid or redeemed in connection with) such Asset Sale Offer exceeds the
amount of Excess Proceeds or if the aggregate principal amount of Notes tendered pursuant to a
Notes Offer exceeds the amount of the Net Available Cash so applied, the Notes and such other pari
_passu Indebtedness, if applicable, will be purchased on a pro rata basis (or in the manner described_
under the caption “—Selection and Notice”), based on the amounts tendered or required to be


-----

prepaid or redeemed. Upon completion of each Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds will
be reset at zero.

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Notes is denominated
in a currency other than the currency in which the relevant Notes are denominated, the amount
thereof payable in respect of such Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in the currency in
which such Notes are denominated that is actually received by the Parent Guarantor or the relevant
Restricted Subsidiary upon converting such portion of the Net Available Cash into such currency.

The Issuer or the Parent Guarantor (as the case may be) will comply with the requirements of Rule
14e-l under the US Exchange Act and any other applicable securities laws and regulations to the
extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with each repurchase of Notes
pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer or a Notes Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities
laws or regulations conflict with the Asset Sale or Notes Offer provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer
or the Parent Guarantor will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be
deemed to have breached its obligations under the Asset Sale or Notes Offer provisions of the
Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

**_Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries_**
The Parent Guarantor will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to,
directly or indirectly, create or permit to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or
restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to:

(1)   pay dividends or make any other distributions on its Capital Stock to the Parent Guarantor or
any Restricted Subsidiary, or with respect to any other interest or participation in, or measured
by, its profits, or pay any Indebtedness owed to the Parent Guarantor or any Restricted
Subsidiary;

(2)   make loans or advances to the Parent Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(3)   sell, lease or transfer any of its properties or assets to the Parent Guarantor or any Restricted
Subsidiary,

_provided that (x) the priority of any preferred stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions_
prior to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination of
(including the application of any standstill period to) loans or advances made to the Parent Guarantor
or any Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness incurred by the Parent Guarantor or any
Restricted Subsidiary, in each case, shall not be deemed to constitute such an encumbrance or
restriction.

However, the preceding restrictions will not apply to encumbrances or restrictions existing under or by
reason of:

(1)   any agreements as in effect on the Issue Date after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions
and any amendments, restatements, modifications, renewals, supplements, refundings,
replacements or refinancings of those agreements; provided that the amendments,
restatements, modifications, renewals, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings
are not materially more disadvantageous, taken as a whole, with respect to such dividend and
other payment restrictions than those contained in those agreements on the Issue Date after
giving pro forma effect to the Transactions (as determined in good faith by the Parent
Guarantor or a member of Senior Management thereof), or would not in the good faith
determination of the Parent Guarantor or a member of Senior Management thereof, materially
impair the ability of the Issuer to make payments on the Notes;

(2)   the Indenture, the Notes, the Guarantees, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security and
Guarantee Documents;

(3)   agreements governing other Indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the provisions of the
covenant described under the caption “—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred
_Stock” and any amendments, restatements, modifications, renewals, supplements, refundings,_
replacements or refinancings of those agreements; provided that the restrictions therein are not


-----

materially more disadvantageous, taken as a whole, to the holders of the Notes than is
customary in comparable financings (as determined in good faith by the Parent Guarantor or a
member of Senior Management thereof) or would not, in the good faith determination of the
Parent Guarantor or a member of Senior Management thereof, materially impair the ability of
the Issuer to make payments on the Notes;

(4)   applicable law, rule, regulation or order, the terms of any license, authorization, concession or
permit, or required by any governmental or regulatory authority;

(5)   any instrument governing Indebtedness or Capital Stock of a Person acquired by the Parent
Guarantor or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries as in effect at the time of such acquisition, or
pursuant to which such instrument is assumed by the Parent Guarantor or any Restricted
Subsidiary in connection with the acquisition of assets or the merger with such Person (except
to the extent such Indebtedness or Capital Stock was incurred in connection with or in
contemplation of such acquisition), which encumbrance or restriction is not applicable to any
Person, or the properties or assets of any Person, other than the Person, or the property or
assets of the Person, so acquired; provided that, in the case of Indebtedness, such
Indebtedness was permitted by the terms of the Indenture to be incurred;

(6)   customary non-assignment and similar provisions in contracts, leases, licenses and joint
venture agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business;

(7)   purchase money obligations for property acquired in the ordinary course of business and
Capital Lease Obligations that impose restrictions on the property purchased or leased of the
nature described in clause (3) of the preceding paragraph;

(8)   any agreement for the sale or other disposition of the Capital Stock or all or substantially all of
the property and assets of a Restricted Subsidiary that restricts distributions by that Restricted
Subsidiary pending its sale or other disposition;

(9)   Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness; provided that the restrictions contained in the agreements
governing such Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness are not materially more disadvantageous,
taken as a whole, than those contained in the agreements governing the Indebtedness being
refinanced as determined in good faith by the Parent Guarantor or a member of Senior
Management thereof, or would not in the good faith determination of the Parent Guarantor or a
member of Senior Management thereof, materially impair the ability of the Issuer to make
payments on the Note;

(10)  Liens permitted to be incurred under the provisions of the covenant described under the
caption “—Liens” that limit the right of the debtor to dispose of the assets subject to such Liens;

(11)  provisions limiting the disposition or distribution of assets or property in joint venture
agreements, asset sale agreements, sale-leaseback agreements, stock sale agreements and
other similar agreements (including agreements entered into in connection with a Restricted
Investment), which limitation is applicable only to the assets that are the subject of such
agreements;

(12)  restrictions on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers or suppliers or
required by insurance, surety or bonding companies, in each case, under contracts entered
into in the ordinary course of business;

(13)  any encumbrance or restriction contained in any agreement relating to, or pertaining to,
Hedging Obligations;

(14)  any encumbrance or restriction:

(a)   that restricts in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any
property or asset that is subject to a lease, license or similar contract, or the assignment
or transfer of any lease, license or other contract;

(b)   contained in mortgages, charges, pledges or other security agreements permitted under
the Indenture or securing Indebtedness of the Parent Guarantor or a Restricted
Subsidiary permitted under the Indenture to the extent such encumbrances or


-----

restrictions restrict the transfer of the property or assets subject to such mortgages,
charges, pledges or other security agreements; or

(c)   pursuant to customary provisions restricting dispositions of real property interests set
forth in any reciprocal easement agreements of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(15)  restrictions effected in connection with a Qualified Receivables Financing that, in the good faith
determination of the Board of Directors of the Parent Guarantor or a member of Senior
Management thereof, are necessary or advisable to effect such Qualified Receivables
Financing; or

(16)  any encumbrance or restriction existing under any agreement that extends, renews, refinances
or replaces the agreements containing the encumbrances or restrictions in the foregoing
clauses (1) through (15), or in this clause (16); provided that the terms and conditions of any
such encumbrances or restrictions (A) are no more disadvantageous, taken as a whole, to the
holders of the Notes than those under or pursuant to the agreement so extended, renewed,
refinanced or replaced (as determined in good faith by the Parent Guarantor or a member of
Senior Management thereof) or (B) are customary in comparable financings (as determined in
good faith by the Parent Guarantor or a member of Senior Management thereof) or (C) would
not in the good faith determination of the Parent Guarantor, materially impair the ability of the
Issuer to make payments on the Notes.

**_Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets_**

_The Parent Guarantor_
The Parent Guarantor will not, directly or indirectly: (1) consolidate or merge with or into another
Person (whether or not the Parent Guarantor is the surviving corporation) or (2) sell, assign, transfer,
lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of the Parent
Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole, in either case, in one or more related
transactions, to another Person, unless:

(1)   either: (a) the Parent Guarantor is the surviving Person; or (b) the Person formed by or
surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than the Parent Guarantor) or to which
such sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance, lease or other disposition has been made is an

Pre-Expansion European Union, Switzerland, Norway, Guernsey, Jersey, Australia, Canada,
any state of the United States or the District of Columbia;

Intercreditor Agreement and the Security and Guarantee Documents to which the Parent
Guarantor is a party;

(3)   immediately after such transaction, no Default or Event of Default exists;

(4)   the Parent Guarantor or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if

_pro forma effect thereto and any related financing transactions as if the same had occurred at_
the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period (i) be permitted to incur at least €1.00 of

-----

satisfied and that the Indenture and the Notes constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of
the Parent Guarantor or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger
(as applicable) enforceable in accordance with their terms (provided that any such opinion of
counsel may assume matters of fact, including as a factual matter that one or more conditions
precedent have occurred and include customary qualifications and reservations).

In the event of any transaction (other than a lease) described in and complying with the conditions
listed in the immediately preceding paragraph in which the Parent Guarantor is not the continuing
corporation, the successor Person formed or remaining or to which such transfer is made shall
succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of the Parent Guarantor,
and the Parent Guarantor will be discharged from all obligations and covenants under the Indenture,
the Notes and the Guarantees.

_The Issuer and Subsidiary Guarantors_

Agreement and the Security and Guarantee Documents to which it is a party, and in the
case of the Issuer, such entity is organized or existing under the laws of the United
Kingdom, any member state of the Pre-Expansion European Union, Switzerland,
Norway, Guernsey, Jersey, Australia, Canada or any state of the United States or the
District of Columbia;

(2)   immediately after giving pro forma effect to such transaction or transactions (and treating any
Indebtedness which becomes an obligation of the surviving corporation as a result of such
transaction as having been incurred by the surviving corporation at the time of such transaction
or transactions), no Default or Event of Default exists; and

(3)   the Parent Guarantor delivers to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and opinion of counsel, in

opinion of counsel may assume matters of fact, including as a factual matter that one or more
conditions precedent have occurred and include customary qualifications and reservations).

This covenant will not apply to (a) any consolidation or merger of any Restricted Subsidiary that is not
a Guarantor into the Issuer or a Guarantor, (b) any consolidation or merger among Guarantors or any
consolidation or merger among Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors, (c) any consolidation
or merger among the Issuer and any Guarantor; provided that, if the Issuer is not the surviving entity
of such merger or consolidation, the relevant Guarantor is an entity organized or existing under the
laws of the United Kingdom, any member state of the Pre-Expansion European Union, Switzerland,
Norway, Jersey, Guernsey, Australia, Canada, any state of the United States or the District of
Columbia and such Guarantor shall assume all of the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes, the


-----

Intercreditor Agreement and the Security and Guarantee Documents to which the Issuer is a party, or
(d) any sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of assets among the Parent
Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries (including, without limitation, pursuant to an adoption of a
plan relating to a liquidation or dissolution of a Restricted Subsidiary); provided that, to the extent
applicable clauses (2) and (5) under the caption “—The Parent Guarantor” and clauses (1) and (3)
under the caption “—The Issuer and Subsidiary Guarantors” of this covenant will be complied with.
Clauses (3) and (4) under the caption “—The Parent Guarantor” and clause (2) under the caption “—
_The Issuer and Subsidiary Guarantors” of this covenant will not apply to any merger or consolidation_
of the Issuer or any Guarantor with or into an Affiliate solely for the purpose of reincorporating the
Issuer or such Guarantor in another jurisdiction, to change its domicile or to change its legal form.

**_Transactions with Affiliates_**
The Parent Guarantor will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make
any payment to or sell, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its properties or assets to, or
purchase any property or assets from, or enter into or make or amend any transaction, contract,
agreement, understanding, loan, advance or guarantee for the benefit of any Affiliate of the Parent
Guarantor (each, an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate payments or consideration in excess
of €5.0 million, unless:

(1)   the Affiliate Transaction, taken as a whole, is on terms that are not materially less favorable to
the Parent Guarantor or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary than those that would have been
obtained in a comparable transaction by the Parent Guarantor or such Restricted Subsidiary
with an unrelated Person (as determined in good faith by the Parent Guarantor or a member of
Senior Management thereof); and

(2)   with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions involving
aggregate consideration in excess of €17.5 million, the Parent Guarantor delivers to the
Trustee, a resolution of the Board of Directors of the Parent Guarantor set forth in an Officer’s
Certificate certifying that such Affiliate Transaction complies with this covenant and that such
Affiliate Transaction has been approved by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors
of the Parent Guarantor.

The following items will not be deemed to be Affiliate Transactions and, therefore, will not be subject
to the provisions of the prior paragraph:

(1)   any employment agreement, collective bargaining agreement, consultant, employee benefit

Restricted Subsidiary, including under any stock option, stock appreciation rights, stock

of directors’ and officers’ insurance premiums) and reimbursements of expenses and legal fees

limitation, the payment of any bonus);

(5)   any issuance of Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Parent Guarantor to
Affiliates of the Parent Guarantor;

(6)   any Investment (other than a Permitted Investment) or other Restricted Payment, in either

-----

(7)   any Permitted Investment (other than Permitted Investments described in clauses (3), (15) and
(19) of the definition thereof);

(8)   the incurrence of any Subordinated Shareholder Debt and any amendment, waiver or other
transaction with respect to any Subordinated Shareholder Debt in compliance with the other
provisions of the Indenture;

(9)   transactions pursuant to, or contemplated by any agreement in effect on the Issue Date and
transactions pursuant to any amendment, modification or extension to such agreement, so long
as such amendment, modification or extension, taken as a whole, is not-materially more
disadvantageous to the holders of the Notes than the original agreement as in effect on the
Issue Date (as determined in good faith by the Parent Guarantor or a member of Senior
Management thereof);

(10)  the entering into any agreement to pay and the payment of Management Advances (including

providers of employees or other labor, in each case in the ordinary course of business and
otherwise in compliance with the terms of this Indenture that are fair to the Parent Guarantor or
the Restricted Subsidiaries, or are on terms at least as favorable as might reasonably have
been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated Person, in either case, in the good faith
determination of the Board of Directors of the Parent Guarantor or a member of Senior
Management thereof;

(12)  payments pursuant to any tax sharing agreement or arrangement among the Parent Guarantor
and its Restricted Subsidiaries and other Persons with which the Parent Guarantor or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries is required or permitted to file a consolidated tax return or with which
the Parent Guarantor or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries is a part of a group for tax purposes;
_provided, however, that such payments will not exceed the amount of tax that the Parent_
Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries would owe on a standalone basis if the Parent
Guarantor were filing a separate tax return (or a separate consolidated or combined tax return
with its Restricted Subsidiaries that are part of that consolidated or combined group);

(13)  issuances or sales of Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Parent Guarantor

Directors of the Parent Guarantor;

(14)  any transactions for which the Parent Guarantor or a Restricted Subsidiary delivers to the
Trustee a letter from an independent financial advisor stating that such transaction is (i) fair to
the Parent Guarantor or such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view or (ii) on
terms not materially less favorable than might have been obtained in a comparable transaction
at such time on an arm’s length basis from a Person who is not an Affiliate;

(15)  any transaction effected as part of a Qualified Receivables Financing;

(16)  any participation in a public tender or exchange offers for securities or debt instruments issued

(18)  investments by any of the Permitted Holders in securities of any of the Parent Guarantor’s

-----

on the same or more favourable terms and (iii) the investment constitutes less than 5.0% of the
proposed issue amount of such class of securities.

**_Additional Guarantees_**
The Parent Guarantor will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that are not
Guarantors or the Issuer, directly or indirectly, to guarantee the payment of, assume or in any manner
become liable with respect to any other Indebtedness under Credit Facilities or Public Debt of the
Issuer or a Guarantor unless such Restricted Subsidiary simultaneously executes and delivers a
supplemental indenture providing for the Note Guarantee of the payment of the Notes by such
Restricted Subsidiary, which Note Guarantee will be senior to or pari passu with such Restricted
Subsidiary’s guarantee of such other Indebtedness.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Note Guarantee shall be required under this
covenant if such Note Guarantee (in the good faith determination of the Parent Guarantor or a
member of Senior Management thereof) could reasonably be expected to give rise to or result in:

-    any violation (or any material risk of any such violation) of applicable law that cannot be
avoided or otherwise prevented through measures reasonably available to the Parent
Guarantor (including any reasonably available “whitewash” procedures or similar procedures
that would be required in order to enable such Note Guarantee to be provided in accordance
with applicable law);

-    any personal liability (criminal, civil, administrative or other) (or any material risk of any such
liability) for any of the officers, directors or shareholders of the Parent Guarantor, any
Subsidiary thereof (including such Restricted Subsidiary) or any parent company; or

-    any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including, without limitation, any Tax or any obligation
to pay any Additional Amount) other than (i) reasonable, routine and immaterial out-of-pocket
expenses; and (ii) reasonable expenses incurred in connection with (x) any governmental or
regulatory filings required as a result of such Note Guarantee or (y) any “whitewash”
procedures (or similar procedures that would be required in order to enable such Note
Guarantee to be provided in accordance with applicable law) undertaken in connection with
such Note Guarantee, which cannot be avoided through measures reasonably available to the
Parent Guarantor or the Restricted Subsidiary.

Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Indenture, each Note Guarantee shall be in such form
and substance, and subject to such terms, conditions, limitations, qualifications and restrictions as
may be necessary or appropriate (in the good faith determination of the Parent Guarantor or a
member of Senior Management thereof) by reason of or to comply with any applicable law, rule or
regulation, including the law of any jurisdiction where the relevant Guarantor is organized or conducts
business, or as necessary to recognize certain defenses generally available to guarantors (including
those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance,
corporate purpose, thin capitalization, distributable reserves, capital maintenance or similar laws,
regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally or otherwise relating to the
insolvency of debtors).

Each Note Guarantee shall be released in accordance with the provisions described under the
caption “—Releases of the Guarantees”. Upon any such occurrence, the Trustee shall execute any
documents reasonably requested in order to evidence such release, discharge and termination in
respect of the applicable Note Guarantee.

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**
The Parent Guarantor will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, take
or knowingly or negligently omit to take, any action that would have the result of materially impairing
the security interest with respect to the Collateral (it being understood that the incurrence of Liens on
the Collateral permitted by the definition of Permitted Collateral Liens shall under no circumstances
be deemed to materially impair the security interest with respect to the Collateral) for the benefit of
the Trustee and the holders of the Notes; and the Parent Guarantor will not, and will not cause or
permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, grant to any Person other than the Security Agent, for the
benefit of the Trustee and the holders of the Notes and the other beneficiaries described in the


-----

Security and Guarantee Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, any interest whatsoever in any of the Collateral; provided that (a) nothing in this provision
will restrict the discharge or release of the Collateral in accordance with the Indenture, the Security
and Guarantee Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
and (b) the Parent Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries may incur Permitted Collateral Liens;
and provided further, that no Collateral Documents may be amended, extended, renewed, restated,
supplemented or otherwise modified, replaced or released other than as provided in the previous
clauses (a) and (b), unless contemporaneously with such amendment, renewal, replacement,
restatement, supplement, modification, extension or release, the Parent Guarantor delivers to the
Trustee one of the following: (1) a solvency opinion from an internationally recognized investment
bank or accounting firm, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee confirming the
solvency of the Parent Guarantor and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to any
transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, supplement, modification, replacement
or release, (2) a certificate from the board of directors or chief financial officer of the Parent
Guarantor (acting in good faith), in the form set forth as an exhibit to the Indenture, that confirms the
solvency of the Person granting such Lien after giving effect to any transaction related to such
amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification, replacement or release or
(3) an opinion of counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee (subject to
customary exceptions, qualifications and assumptions), confirming that, after giving effect to any
transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification
or replacement, the Lien or Liens securing the Notes created under the Security and Guarantee
Documents so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, modified, replaced or released
and retaken are valid and perfected Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new
hardening period, in equity or at law, and that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to
immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification,
replacement or release.

At the direction of the Issuer and without the consent of the holder of Notes, the Security Agent may
from time to time enter into one or more amendments to the Security and Guarantee Documents to:
(i) cure any ambiguity, mistake, omission, defect or inconsistency therein, (ii) subject to compliance
with the first paragraph of this covenants, provide for Permitted Collateral Liens, (iii) comply with the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (iv) add to the
Collateral, (v) evidence the succession of another Person to the Issuer or any Guarantor and the
assumption by such successor of the obligations under the Indenture, the Notes and the Security and
Guarantee Documents, in each case, including in accordance with the caption “—Certain
_Covenants—Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets”, (vi) provide for the release of property and_
assets constituting Collateral from the Lien of the Security and Guarantee Documents and/or the
release of the Note Guarantee of a Guarantor, in each case, in accordance with the terms of the
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant
Security and Guarantee Documents, in each case, (vii) conform the Security and Guarantee
Documents to this “Description of Notes”, (viii) to evidence and provide for the acceptance of the
appointment of a successor Trustee or Security Agent or (ix) make any other change thereto that
does not adversely affect rights of the holders of the Notes in any material respect.

In the event that the Issuer complies with this covenant, the Trustee and the Security Agent will
(subject to customary protections and indemnifications) consent to such amendment, extension,
renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement with no need for instructions from
holders of the Notes.

**_Collateral_**
The Parent Guarantor will, and will procure that each of its Restricted Subsidiaries will, at its own
expense, execute and do all such acts and things and provide such assurances as the Security Agent
(if applicable) may reasonably require (1) for registering any Security and Guarantee Documents in
any required register and for perfecting or protecting the security intended to be afforded by such
Security and Guarantee Documents; and (2) if such Security and Guarantee Documents have
become enforceable, for facilitating the realization of all or any part of the assets which are subject to
such Security and Guarantee Documents and for facilitating the exercise of all powers, authorities
and discretions vested in the Security Agent or in any receiver of all or any part of those assets. The
Parent Guarantor will, and will procure that each of its Restricted Subsidiaries will, execute all


-----

transfers, conveyances, assignments and releases of that property whether to the Security Agent or
to its nominees and give all notices, orders and directions which the Security Agent may reasonably
request, in each case, as applicable.

**_Limitation on Issuer Activities_**
The Issuer will not engage in any business activity except any activity (a) reasonably relating to the
offering, sale, issuance, incurrence and servicing, purchase, redemption, amendment, exchange,
refinancing or retirement of the Notes (including Additional Notes), the incurrence of Indebtedness
represented by the Notes or other Indebtedness of the Issuer permitted by the Indenture (including
any Indebtedness incurred in the future and the making of any guarantee) and distributing, lending or
otherwise advancing the proceeds thereof to the Parent Guarantor or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries, including making Investments pursuant to the Proceeds Loans or any Additional
Proceeds Loan with the proceeds thereof permitted by the Indenture (including the lending of the
proceeds from the incurrence of such Indebtedness and the receipt of interest thereon),
(b) undertaken with the purpose of, related or ancillary to, or otherwise incidental or resulting from the
incurrence of such Indebtedness or the making of such Investments; including any obligations under
the Security and Guarantee Documents, the Proceeds Loans, the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and any repurchase, purchase, repayment, redemption,
refinancing or prepayment of, or any consent or amendment with respect to, such Indebtedness,
(c) undertaken with the purpose of, related or ancillary to or otherwise incidental or resulting from the
establishment and maintenance of the Issuer’s corporate existence, (d) other activities that are not
material or de minimis in nature (as compared to the consolidated business activities of the Parent
Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole) or otherwise could not reasonably be
expected to result in an Event of Default pursuant to clause (8) of the definition thereof, (e) relating to
the granting of Permitted Liens and Permitted Collateral Liens if the granting of such Liens was
otherwise permitted by the Indenture, (f) involving the provision of administrative or other related
services, (g) related to any purchase agreement (including the Acquisition Agreement), and/or any
document entered into in connection with the issuance of the Notes or any other Indebtedness or
other activity or action permitted under the Indenture; (h) related to or in connection with the
Transactions or as otherwise described in the Offering Memorandum; or (i) reasonably related to any
or a combination of the foregoing. The Issuer shall not (a) issue any Capital Stock (other than as
permitted by the covenant under the caption “—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets” or the
issuance of directors’ qualifying shares and other nominal amounts of Capital Stock that are required
to be held by other Persons under applicable law) or (y) undertake any transaction that will require
the Issuer to register as an “investment company” or an entity “controlled by an investment company”
as defined in the US Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended and the rules and regulations
thereunder.

The Issuer and Bidco will not (i) sell, dispose, encumber, prepay, repay, repurchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire, reduce or retire any amounts outstanding under the Proceeds Loans except (a) in
connection with a redemption of outstanding Notes in a manner permitted by the Indenture, (b) in
connection with the making of a Permitted Collateral Lien, (c) as provided for in the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Documents or as provided under the
caption “—Security—Release” and (d) in connection with a transaction permitted by the covenant
described under the caption “—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets” or (ii) amend, modify,
supplement or waive any rights under the Proceeds Loans in a manner that would adversely affect in
any material respect the rights of the Issuer or its creditors with respect to the Proceeds Loans.

**_Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries_**

The Board of Directors of the Parent Guarantor may designate any Restricted Subsidiary to be an
Unrestricted Subsidiary if that designation would not cause a Default. If a Restricted Subsidiary is
designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the aggregate Fair Market Value of all outstanding
Investments owned by the Parent Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary
designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be deemed to be an Investment made as of the time of
the designation and will reduce the amount available for Restricted Payments under the covenant
described under the caption “—Restricted Payments” or under one or more clauses of the definition
of Permitted Investments, as determined by the Parent Guarantor. That designation will only be
permitted if the Investment would be permitted at that time and if the Restricted Subsidiary otherwise


-----

meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary. The Parent Guarantor may redesignate any
Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary if that redesignation would not cause a Default.

Any designation of a Subsidiary of the Parent Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be
evidenced to the Trustee by filing with the Trustee a copy of a resolution of the Parent Guarantor’s
Board of Directors giving effect to such designation and an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such
designation complies with the preceding conditions and was permitted by the covenant described
under the caption “—Restricted Payments.” If, at any time, any Unrestricted Subsidiary would fail to
meet the preceding requirements as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, it will thereafter cease to be an
Unrestricted Subsidiary for purposes of the Indenture and any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary will
be deemed to be incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date and, if such Indebtedness is not
permitted to be incurred as of such date under the covenant described under the caption
“—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock,” the Parent Guarantor will be in
default of such covenant. The Board of Directors of the Parent Guarantor may at any time designate
any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary; provided that such designation will be
deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary of any outstanding
Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary, and such designation will only be permitted if (1) such
Indebtedness is permitted under the covenant described under the caption “—Incurrence of
_Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock,” calculated on a pro forma basis as if such_
designation had occurred at the beginning of the applicable reference period; and (2) no Default or
Event of Default would be in existence following such designation.

**_Maintenance of Listing_**

The Issuer will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain the listing of the Notes
on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange for trading on the Euro MTF market for so
long as such Notes are outstanding; provided that if the Issuer is unable to obtain such listing and
admission to trading or if at any time the Issuer determines that it will not maintain such listing, it will
use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain a listing of such Notes on another
“recognized stock exchange” as defined in Section 1005 of the Income Tax Act 2007 of the United
Kingdom. In no event will this covenant require the Issuer to obtain or maintain the listing of the
Notes on any exchange that requires financial reporting for any fiscal period in addition to the fiscal
periods required by the covenant described under the caption “—Reports.”

**_Reports_**

For so long as any Notes are outstanding, the Parent Guarantor will furnish to the Trustee the
following reports:

(1)   within 120 days (150 days for the first fiscal year following the Issue Date) after the end of
each of the Parent Guarantor’s fiscal years, annual reports containing the following information:
(a) audited consolidated balance sheet of the Parent Guarantor as of the end of the two most
recent fiscal years and audited consolidated income statements and statements of cash flow of
the Parent Guarantor for the two most recent fiscal years, including footnotes to such financial
statements and the report of the independent auditors on the financial statements; (b) pro
_forma income statement and balance sheet information of the Parent Guarantor (which need_
not comply with Article 11 of Regulation S-X under the US Exchange Act), together with
explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations that have
occurred since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal year as to which such
annual report relates (unless such pro forma information has been provided in a previous
report pursuant to clauses (2) or (3) below), provided that such pro forma financial information
will be provided only to the extent available without unreasonable expense, in which case, the
Parent Guarantor will provide, in the case of a material acquisition, acquired company
financials to the extent reasonably available; (c) to the extent relating to annual periods, an
operating and financial review of the audited financial statements, including a discussion of the
results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and capital resources, and a discussion of
material commitments and contingencies and critical accounting policies; (d) a description of
the business, senior management and principal shareholders of the Parent Guarantor, material
affiliate transactions and material debt instruments; and (e) material risk factors and material
recent developments (to the extent not previously reported pursuant to clause (2) or (3) below);


-----

_provided that the information described in clauses (d) and (e) may be provided in the footnotes_
to the audited financial statements;

(2)   within 60 days (or 75 days for the report provided by the Parent Guarantor following the
completion of the second quarter of each year) following the end of each of the first three fiscal
quarters in each fiscal year of the Parent Guarantor, quarterly reports containing the following
information: (a) an unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of the end of such
fiscal quarter and unaudited condensed statements of income and cash flow for the year to
date periods ending on the unaudited condensed balance sheet date, and the comparable prior
year periods for the Parent Guarantor, together with condensed footnote disclosure; (b) pro
_forma income statement and balance sheet information of the Parent Guarantor (or any_
predecessor entity) (which need not comply with Article 11 of Regulation S-X under the US
Exchange Act), together with explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions
or recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of the most recently completed
fiscal quarter as to which such quarterly report relates (unless such pro forma information has
been provided in a previous report pursuant to clauses (1) above or (3) below), provided that
such pro forma financial information will be provided only to the extent available without
unreasonable expense, in which case, the Parent Guarantor will provide, in the case of a
material acquisition, acquired company financials to the extent reasonably available; (c) a
summary operating and financial review of the unaudited financial statements, including a
summary discussion of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the
Parent Guarantor and any material change between the current fiscal quarter and the
corresponding period of the prior year; and (d) material recent developments (to the extent not
previously reported pursuant to clauses (1) above or (3) below), provided that the information
described in clause (d) may be provided in the footnotes to the audited financial statements;
and

(3)   promptly after the occurrence of any material acquisition, disposition or restructuring of the
Parent Guarantor and the Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or any changes of the
Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer at the Parent Guarantor or change in auditors
of the Parent Guarantor or any other material event that the Parent Guarantor announces
publicly, a report containing a description of such event,

_provided, however, that the reports set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above will not be required to_
(i) contain any reconciliation to US generally accepted accounting principles and (ii) include separate
financial statements for the Issuer, any Guarantor or non-guarantor Subsidiaries of the Parent
Guarantor.

In addition, if the Parent Guarantor has designated any of its Subsidiaries as Unrestricted
Subsidiaries and such Subsidiaries are Significant Subsidiaries, then the quarterly and annual
financial information required by the preceding paragraph will include a reasonably detailed
presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial
condition and results of operations of the Parent Guarantor and the Restricted Subsidiaries separate
from the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Parent
Guarantor.

All financial statement information shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS as in effect on the date
of such report or financial statement (or otherwise on the basis of IFRS as then in effect) and on a
consistent basis for the periods presented, except as may otherwise be described in such
information; provided, however, that the reports set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above may, in the
event of a change in IFRS, present earlier periods on a basis that applied to such periods. Except as
provided above, no report need include separate financial statements for any Subsidiaries of the
Parent Guarantor or any disclosure with respect to the results of operations or any other financial or
statistical disclosure not of a type included in this Offering Memorandum.

For purposes of this covenant, an acquisition or disposition shall be deemed to be material if the
entity or business acquired or disposed of represents greater than 20% of the Parent Guarantor’s
(a) total revenue or Consolidated EBITDA for the most recent four quarters for which annual or
quarterly financial reports have been delivered to the Trustee or (b) consolidated assets as of the last
day of the most recent quarter for which annual or quarterly financial reports have been delivered to
the Trustee. In addition, for so long as any Notes remain outstanding, the Issuer has agreed that it


-----

will furnish to the holders and to securities analysts and prospective investors, upon their request, the
information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the US Securities Act.

Contemporaneously with the furnishing of each such report discussed above, the Issuer will post
such report on a publicly accessible website maintained by the Parent Guarantor or any of its
Affiliates for such purpose.

If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and
admitted for trading on the Euro MTF market and the rules of that exchange will so require, the above
information will also be made available through the office of the Registrar or the registered office of
the Issuer.

In the event that (i) the Parent Guarantor becomes subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the US Exchange Act, or elects to comply with such provisions, for so long
as it continues to file the reports required by Section 13(a) with the SEC or (ii) the Parent Guarantor
elects to provide to the Trustee reports which, if filed with the SEC, would satisfy (in the good faith
judgment of the Parent Guarantor or a member of Senior Management thereof) the reporting
requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the US Exchange Act (other than the provision of US GAAP
information, certifications, exhibits or information as to internal controls and procedures), for so long
as it elects, the Parent Guarantor will make available to the Trustee such annual reports, information,
documents and other reports that the Issuer is, or would be, required to file with the SEC pursuant to
such Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the US Exchange Act.

The Parent Guarantor may comply with any requirement to provide reports or financial statements
required by this covenant by providing any report or financial statement of a direct or indirect parent
of the Parent Guarantor so long as the Parent Guarantor is a wholly owned subsidiary of such parent
and such parent provides a Guarantee of the Notes; provided that, if the financial statements of a
parent are included in such report, a reasonably detailed description of material differences between
the consolidated financial statements of such parent and the Parent Guarantor shall be provided.
Upon complying with the foregoing requirement, the Parent Guarantor will be deemed to have
complied with the provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs.

**_Suspension of Certain Covenants when Notes Rated Investment Grade_**
If on any date following the Completion Date:

(1)   the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status; and

(2)   no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and is continuing on such date,

then, beginning on that day and continuing until such time, if any, at which the Notes cease to have
Investment Grade Status (such period, the “Suspension Period”), the covenants set forth under the
following captions in this “Description of Notes” will no longer be applicable to the Notes and any
related default provisions of the Indenture will cease to be effective and will not be applicable to the
Parent Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries:

(1)   “—Asset Sales;”

(2)   “—Restricted Payments;”

(3)   “—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock;”

(4)   “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries;”

(5)   “—Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries;”

(6)   “—Transactions with Affiliates;”

(7)   “—Additional Guarantees;” and

(8)   clause (4) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under the caption “—Merger,
_Consolidation or Sale of Assets.”_


-----

Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with regard to the actions of the Parent Guarantor
and the Restricted Subsidiaries properly taken during the continuance of the Suspension Period;
_provided that (1) with respect to the Restricted Payments made after any such reinstatement, the_
amount of Restricted Payments will be calculated as though the covenant described under the
caption “—Restricted Payments” had been in effect prior to, but not during, the Suspension Period
and (2) all Indebtedness incurred, or Disqualified Stock or preferred stock issued, during the
Suspension Period will be classified to have been incurred or issued pursuant to clause (2) of the
second paragraph of the covenant described under the caption “—Incurrence of Indebtedness and
_Issuance of Preferred Stock.” Upon the occurrence of a Suspension Period, the amount of Excess_
Proceeds shall be reset at zero. In addition, the Indenture will also permit, without causing a Default
or Event of Default, the Parent Guarantor or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to honor any
contractual commitments or take actions in the future after any date on which the Notes cease to
have an Investment Grade Status as long as the contractual commitments were entered into during
the Suspension Period and not in anticipation of the Notes no longer having an Investment Grade
Status. The Parent Guarantor or the Issuer shall notify the Trustee that the conditions set forth in the
first paragraph under this caption has been satisfied, provided that, no such notification shall be a
condition for the suspension of the covenants described under this covenant to be effective. The
Trustee shall not be obligated to notify holders of such event.

There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain an Investment Grade Status.

**_Financial Calculations for Limited Condition Acquisitions_**
When calculating the availability under any basket or ratio under the Indenture, in each case in
connection with a Limited Condition Acquisition, the date of determination of such basket or ratio and
of any Default or Event of Default shall, at the option of the Parent Guarantor or the Issuer, be the
date the definitive agreements for such Limited Condition Acquisition are entered into, and such
baskets or ratios shall be calculated with such pro forma adjustments as are appropriate and
consistent with the pro forma provisions set forth in the definition of Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio
after giving effect to such Limited Condition Acquisition and the other transactions to be entered into
in connection therewith (including any incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof)
as if they occurred at the beginning of the applicable period for purposes of determining the ability to
consummate any such Limited Condition Acquisition (and not for purposes of any subsequent
availability of any basket or ratio), and, for the avoidance of doubt, (1) if any of such baskets or ratios
are exceeded as a result of fluctuations in such basket or ratio (including due to fluctuations in the
Consolidated EBITDA of the Parent Guarantor or the target company) subsequent to such date of
determination and at or prior to the consummation of the relevant Limited Condition Acquisition, such
baskets or ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded as a result of such fluctuations solely for
purposes of determining whether the Limited Condition Acquisition is permitted hereunder and
(2) such baskets or ratios shall not be tested at the time of consummation of such Limited Condition
Acquisition or related transactions; provided, further, that if the Parent Guarantor or the Issuer elects
to have such determinations occur at the time of entry into such definitive agreement, any such
transactions (including any incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds therefrom) shall be
deemed to have occurred on the date the definitive agreements are entered and outstanding
thereafter for purposes of calculating any baskets or ratios under the Indenture after the date of such
agreement and before the consummation of such Limited Condition Acquisition.

**Additional or Amended Intercreditor Agreement**
The Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Issuer or the Parent Guarantor, at the time of, or
prior to, the incurrence by the Issuer or any Guarantor of Indebtedness permitted pursuant to (x) the
first paragraph of the covenant described under the caption “—Certain Covenants —Incurrence of
_Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock” or clauses (1), (4), (8), (13), (17) and (18) of the_
second paragraph of the covenant described under the caption “—Certain Covenants —Incurrence of
_Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock” and (y) any Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness in_
respect of Indebtedness referred to in the foregoing clause (x) as well as clause (3) of the second
paragraph of the covenant described under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Incurrence of
_Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock”, the Issuer, the relevant Guarantors, the Trustee and_
the Security Agent will (without the consent of the holders of the Notes) enter into an additional
intercreditor agreement (each an “Additional Intercreditor Agreement”) on terms substantially similar


-----

to the Intercreditor Agreement (or not materially less favorable to the holders of the Notes taken as a
whole) or an amendment to or an amendment and restatement or other modification of the
Intercreditor Agreement (which amendment does not adversely affect the rights of holder of the Notes
in any material respect); provided that such Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor
Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or the Security Agent or adversely
affect the rights, duties, liabilities, indemnifications or immunities of the Trustee or the Security Agent
under the Indenture, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Intercreditor Agreement without the
consent of the Trustee or Security Agent.

The Indenture also will provide that, at the direction of the Parent Guarantor and without the consent
of holders of the Notes, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or
more amendments to any Intercreditor Agreement to: (1) cure any ambiguity, omission, error, defect
or inconsistency of any such agreement, (2) increase the amount or types of Indebtedness covered
by any such agreement that may be incurred by the Parent Guarantor or a Restricted Subsidiary that
is subject to any such agreement (including with respect to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, the addition of provisions relating to new Indebtedness ranking junior in right
of payment to the Notes), (3) add Restricted Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor Agreement or an
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (4) further secure the Notes (including Additional Notes), (5) make
provision for equal and ratable pledges of the Collateral to secure Additional Notes, (6) implement
any Permitted Collateral Liens, (7) amend the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof or (8) make any other change to any such
agreement that does not adversely affect the holders of the Notes in any material respect. The Parent
Guarantor shall not otherwise direct the Trustee or the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to
any Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of the holders of the Notes of the majority in
aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, except as otherwise permitted below
under the caption “—Amendment, Supplement and Waivers,” and the Parent Guarantor may only
direct the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to the extent such amendment
does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the
Trustee or Security Agent, adversely affect their respective rights, duties, liabilities, indemnifications
or immunities under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement without the consent of the Trustee or Security Agent.

The Indenture shall also provide that, in relation to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee (and Security Agent, if applicable) shall consent on behalf of the
holders of the Notes to the payment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition,
retirement or redemption of any obligations subordinated to the Notes thereby; provided, that such
transaction would comply with the covenant described under the caption “—Certain Covenants—
_Restricted Payments.”_

The Indenture will provide that each holder of a Note, by accepting such Note, will be deemed to
have agreed to, accepted the terms and conditions of, and to have directed the Trustee and the
Security Agent to enter into, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
and any amendment, restatement or other modification referred to in the preceding paragraph
(whether then entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to the provisions described herein)
and the Trustee or the Security Agent will not be required to seek the consent of any holders of Notes
to perform its obligations under and in accordance with this covenant.

**Events of Default and Remedies**
Each of the following is an “Event of Default” under the Indenture:

(1)   default for 30 continuous days in the payment when due of interest or Additional Amounts, if
any, with respect to the Notes;

(2)   default in the payment when due (at maturity, upon redemption or otherwise) of the principal of,
or premium, if any, on, the Notes;

(3)   failure by the Issuer or relevant Guarantor for 60 continuous days after written notice (i) to the
Issuer by the Trustee or (ii) to the Issuer and the Trustee by the holders of at least 30% in
aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding voting as a single class to comply


-----

with any of the agreements in the Indenture (other than a default in performance, or breach, or
a covenant or agreement which is specifically dealt with in clauses (1) or (2));

(4)   default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by
which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Parent
Guarantor or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is guaranteed by the
Parent Guarantor or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries), whether such Indebtedness or
guarantee now exists, or is created after the Issue Date, if that default:

(a)   is caused by a failure to pay principal when due of such Indebtedness immediately upon
the expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness (a “Payment Default”);
or

(b)   results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its express maturity,

and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal
amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a Payment Default or the
maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates €20.0 million or more;

(5)   failure by the Parent Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Significant Subsidiary or
any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a Significant
Subsidiary, to pay final judgments entered by a court or courts of competent jurisdiction
aggregating in excess of €20.0 million (exclusive of any amounts that an insurance company
has acknowledged liability for), which judgments shall not have been discharged or waived and
there shall have been a period of 60 consecutive days during which a stay of enforcement of
such judgment or order, by reason of an appeal, waiver or otherwise, shall not have been in
effect;

(6)   except as permitted by the Indenture (including with respect to any limitations), any Note
Guarantee of a Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary or any group of Guarantors that,
taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary is held in any judicial proceeding to be
unenforceable or invalid or ceases for any reason to be in full force and effect, or any
Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary or any group of Guarantors that, taken together,
would constitute a Significant Subsidiary, or any Person acting on behalf of any such Guarantor
or Guarantors, denies or disaffirms its obligations under its Note Guarantee and such Default
continues for 60 consecutive days;

(7)   (a) any security interest over Collateral with a Fair Market Value greater than €5.0 million
created by any Security and Guarantee Document ceases to be in full force and effect (except
as permitted by the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security and
Guarantee Documents) or any assertion by Holdco, the Parent Guarantor or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries that any such Collateral is not subject to a valid, perfected security
interest (except as permitted by the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and the
Security and Guarantee Documents); provided that, there is a material and adverse effect on
the interest of the holders of Notes or (b) the repudiation by Holdco, the Parent Guarantor or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of any of its material obligations under any Security and
Guarantee Document affecting Collateral with a Fair Market Value greater than €5.0 million,
and in either the case of (a) or (b) such Default continues for 60 consecutive days; and

(8)   certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency described in the Indenture with respect to Holdco,
the Parent Guarantor or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that is a Significant Subsidiary or any
group of its Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a Significant
Subsidiary.

In the case of an Event of Default arising from certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency, with
respect to the Issuer or any Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary or any group of Guarantors
that, taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary, all outstanding Notes will become due
and payable immediately without further action or notice or other act on the part of the Trustee or any
holders of Notes. If any other Event of Default occurs and is continuing and subject to the terms and
conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee or the
holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes by written notice
to the Issuer (and to the Trustee if such notice is given by the holders) may and the Trustee, upon the


-----

written request of such holders, shall declare all amounts in respect of the Notes to be due and
payable immediately.

Subject to certain limitations and subject to the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement or
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
then outstanding Notes may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee may
withhold from holders of the Notes notice of any continuing Default or Event of Default if it determines
that withholding notice is in their interest, except a Default or Event of Default relating to the payment
of principal, interest or Additional Amounts or premium, if any.

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, in case an Event of
Default occurs and is continuing of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has written notice of, the
Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the
request or direction of any holders of Notes unless such holders have offered (and if accepted,
provided) to the Trustee indemnity and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability
or expense. Except (subject to the provisions described under the caption “—Amendment,
_Supplement and Waiver”) to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium, if any, or_
interest or Additional Amounts when due, and subject to the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, no holder of a Note may pursue any remedy
with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless:

(1)   such holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2)   holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have
requested, in writing, that the Trustee pursue the remedy;

(3)   such holders have offered the Trustee security and/or indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee
against any loss, liability or expense;

(4)   the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request
and the offer of security and/or indemnity; and

(5)   holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have not
given the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.

The holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding may,
on behalf of the holders of all outstanding Notes, waive any past default under the Indenture and its
consequences, except a continuing default in the payment of the principal of premium, if any, any
Additional Amounts or interest on any Note held by a non-consenting holder (which may only be
waived with the consent of each holder of Notes affected).

The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an
Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default or Event of Default that
occurred during the previous fiscal year. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within
30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would
constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Parent Guarantor and/or the Issuer is
taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.

The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a report or a required
certificate in connection with another default (an “Initial Default”), then at the time such Initial Default
is cured, such Default for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the
Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for
the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant described under the caption
“—Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other
provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required
by such covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the
prescribed period specified in the Indenture.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Stockholders**
No director, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder of the Issuer, any Guarantor or any of their
shareholders or Affiliates, as such, will have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer or the
Guarantors under the Notes, the Indenture and the Note Guarantees or for any claim based on, in


-----

respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each holder of Notes by accepting a
Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for
issuance of the Notes. The waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under applicable securities
laws.

**Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance**
The Issuer may at any time, at the option of its Board of Directors evidenced by a resolution set forth
in an Officer’s Certificate, elect to have all of its obligations discharged with respect to the outstanding
Notes and all obligations of the Guarantors discharged with respect to their Note Guarantees (“Legal
_Defeasance”) except for:_

(1)   the rights of holders of outstanding Notes to receive payments in respect of the principal of, or
interest (including Additional Amounts) or premium, if any, on, such Notes when such payments
are due from the trust referred to below;

(2)   the Issuer’s obligations with respect to the Notes concerning issuing temporary Notes,
registration of Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an
office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust;

(3)   the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee, and the Issuer’s and the
Guarantors’ obligations in connection therewith; and

(4)   the Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance provisions of the Indenture.

In addition, the Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have the obligations of the Issuer
and the Guarantors released with respect to certain covenants (including its obligation to make
Change of Control Offers and Asset Sale Offers) that are described in the Indenture (“Covenant
_Defeasance”) and thereafter any omission to comply with those covenants will not constitute a_
Default or Event of Default with respect to the Notes. In the event Covenant Defeasance occurs, all
Events of Default described under the caption “—Events of Default and Remedies” (except those
relating to payments on the Notes or, solely with respect to the Issuer, bankruptcy or insolvency
events) will no longer constitute an Event of Default with respect to the Notes.

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance:

(1)   the Issuer must irrevocably deposit with the Trustee (or such other entity designated or
appointed (as agent) by it for such purpose), in trust, for the benefit of the holders of the Notes,
cash in euro, European Government Obligations or a combination of cash in euro and
European Government Obligations, in amounts as will be sufficient, in the opinion of a
nationally recognized investment bank, appraisal firm or firm of independent public
accountants, to pay the principal of, or interest (including Additional Amounts and premium, if
any) on the outstanding Notes on the stated date for payment thereof or on the applicable
redemption date, as the case may be, and the Issuer must specify whether the Notes are being
defeased to such stated date for payment or to a particular redemption date;

(2)   in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an opinion of United
States counsel confirming that (a) the Issuer has received from, or there has been published
by, the US Internal Revenue Service a ruling or (b) since the Issue Date, there has been a
change in the applicable US federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and based
thereon such opinion of counsel will confirm that, the holders of the outstanding Notes will not
recognize income, gain or loss for US federal income tax purposes as a result of such Legal
Defeasance and will be subject to tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the
same times as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred;

(3)   in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an opinion of
United States counsel confirming that the holders of the outstanding Notes will not recognize
income, gain or loss for US federal income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant
Defeasance and will be subject to US federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same
manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance had
not occurred;


-----

(4)   the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not
made by the Issuer with the intent of preferring the holders of Notes over the other creditors of
the Issuer or the Guarantors with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding any
creditors of the Issuer, the Guarantors or others; and

(5)   the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an opinion of counsel, subject
to customary assumptions and qualifications, each stating that all conditions precedent relating
to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant Defeasance have been complied with.

**Amendment, Supplement and Waiver**
Except as provided otherwise in the succeeding paragraphs, the Indenture, the Notes, the Note
Guarantees, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security and
Guarantee Documents may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the holders of at least
a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including, without limitation,
consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes), and
any existing Default or Event of Default or compliance with any provision of the Indenture, the Notes,
the Note Guarantees, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or any
Security and Guarantee Documents may be waived with the consent of the holders of a majority in
aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes (including, without limitation, consents
obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes).

If any amendment, supplement or waiver to the Indenture, the Notes, the Note Guarantees or the
Security and Guarantee Documents will only affect the Fixed Rate Notes or the Floating Rate Notes,
only the Holders of a majority (or super majority, as the case may be) in aggregate principal amount
of the then outstanding Fixed Rate Notes or Floating Rate Notes (and not the consent of the Holders
of the majority (or super majority, as the case may be) of all of the Notes), as the case may be, shall
be required. Notwithstanding the foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt, it is understood and
agreed that (a) any matter described in clause (1), (2), (3), (5) and (6) in the next succeeding
paragraph that by its terms applies to the Fixed Rate Notes shall require the consent of 90% of the
holders of the Fixed Rate Notes in order for it to be binding on all holders of the Fixed Rate Notes
and (b) any matter described in clause (1), (2), (3), (5) and (6) in the next succeeding paragraph that
by its terms applies to the Floating Rate Notes shall require the consent of 90% of the holders of the
Floating Rate Notes in order for it to be binding on all holders of the Floating Rate Notes.

Unless consented to by the holders of at least 90% (or, in the case of clause (8) below, 75%) of the
aggregate principal amount of then outstanding Notes (including, without limitation, consents obtained
in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes), without the consent of
each holder of Notes affected, an amendment, supplement or waiver may not (with respect to any
Notes held by a non-consenting holder):

(1)   reduce the principal of or change the fixed maturity of any Note or alter the provisions with
respect to the redemption of the Notes (other than provisions relating to the covenants
described under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Repurchase at the Option of Holders”);

(2)   reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest, including default interest, on any
Note;

(3)   impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with respect to such
holder’s Notes or any guarantee in respect thereof;

(4)   waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of, or interest, Additional
Amounts or premium, if any, on, the Notes (except a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by
the holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes
and a waiver of the Payment Default that resulted from such acceleration);

(5)   make any Note payable in money other than that stated in the Notes (except to the extent the
currency stated in the Notes has been superseded or replaced pursuant to applicable law);

(6)   waive a redemption payment with respect to any Note (other than a payment required by one
of the covenants described under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Repurchase at the
_Option of Holders”);_


-----

(7)   release the Parent Guarantee or release any Subsidiary Guarantor that is a Significant
Subsidiary or any group of Subsidiary Guarantors that, taken together, would constitute a
Significant Subsidiary from any of their obligations under their Note Guarantees or the
Indenture, except in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor
Agreement;

(8)   release all or substantially all of the Liens on the Collateral granted for the benefit of the
holders of Notes, except in accordance with the terms of the relevant Security and Guarantee
Documents, the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement; or

(9)   make any change in the preceding amendment and waiver provisions.

For the avoidance of doubt, no amendment to or deletion of, or actions taken in compliance with, the
covenants described under the caption “—Certain Covenants,” shall be deemed to impair or affect
any rights of holders of the Notes to receive payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on,
the Notes.

Notwithstanding the preceding, without the consent of any holder of Notes, the Issuer, the
Guarantors, the Security Agent and the Trustee (as applicable) may amend or supplement the
Indenture, the Notes, the Note Guarantees, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement or any Security and Guarantee Documents:

(1)   to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, error or inconsistency;

(2)   to provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes (provided, that
the uncertificated Notes are issued in registered form for purposes of Section 163(f) of the
US Internal Revenue Code);

(3)   to provide for the assumption of the Issuer’s or a Guarantor’s obligations to holders of Notes
and Note Guarantees in the case of a merger or consolidation or sale of all or substantially all
of the Issuer’s or such Guarantor’s assets, as applicable;

(4)   to make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the holders of Notes
or that does not adversely affect the legal rights under the Indenture of any such holder in any
material respect;

(5)   to conform the text of the Indenture, the Note Guarantees, the Notes or the Security and
Guarantee Documents to any provision of this “Description of Notes” to the extent that such
provision in this “Description of Notes” was intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision
of the Indenture, the Note Guarantees, the Notes or the Security and Guarantee Documents;

(6)   to release any Note Guarantee and/or to release a Lien over any of the Collateral securing the
Notes in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Security and Guarantee Documents;

(7)   to make provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Issuer or a member of
Senior Management thereof) to provide for the issuance of Additional Notes; provided the
issuance of such Additional Notes is in compliance with the covenants described under the
captions “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock”
and “—Certain Covenants—Liens”;

(8)   to provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Guarantee in accordance with the
covenant described under the captions “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness and
_Issuance of Preferred Stock” or “—Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees”, to add_
Guarantees with respect to the Notes, to add security to or for the benefit of the Notes, or to
confirm and evidence the release, termination, discharge or retaking of any Guarantee or Lien
(including the Collateral and the Security and Guarantee Documents) or any amendment in
respect thereof with respect to or securing the Notes when such release, termination,
discharge or retaking or amendment is provided for under the Indenture, the Security and
Guarantee Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(9)   to enter into additional or supplemental Security and Guarantee Documents or otherwise add
to the Collateral;


-----

(10)  to add additional parties to the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
or any Security and Guarantee Document to the extent permitted hereunder or thereunder and
to make changes contemplated under the Indenture, or to enter into an Additional Intercreditor
Agreement pursuant to the provisions under, the caption “—Additional or Amended Intercreditor
_Agreement”; or_

(11)  to evidence and provide the acceptance of the appointment of a successor Trustee or the
Security Agent under the Indenture or to evidence and provide the acceptance of the
appointment of a Security Agent under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement or any applicable Collateral Document.

The consent of the holders of Notes is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular
form of any proposed amendment, supplement or waiver. It is sufficient if such consent approves the
substance of the proposed amendment, supplement or waiver. A consent to any amendment,
supplement or waiver under the Indenture by any holder of Notes given in connection with a tender of
such holder’s Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender.

In connection with such matters, the Trustee and Security Agent (as applicable) shall be entitled to
rely absolutely on an opinion of counsel and an Officer’s Certificate.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**
The Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to all Notes issued
thereunder, when:

(1)   either:

(a)   all Notes that have been authenticated and delivered, except lost, stolen or destroyed
Notes that have been replaced or paid and Notes for whose payment money has been
deposited in trust and thereafter repaid to the Issuer or discharged from such trust as
provided for in the Indenture, have been delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation;
or

(b)   all Notes that have not been delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation have become
due and payable by reason of the mailing of a notice of redemption or otherwise or will
become due and payable within one year and the Issuer or any Guarantor has
irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or such other entity
designated or appointed (as agent) by it for such purpose) as trust funds in trust solely
for the benefit of the holders, cash in euro, European Government Obligations or a
combination of cash in euro and European Government Obligations, in amounts as will
be sufficient, without consideration of any reinvestment of interest, to pay and discharge
the entire Indebtedness on the Notes not delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation
for principal, premium and Additional Amounts, if any, and accrued interest to the date of
maturity or redemption;

(2)   the Issuer or any Guarantor has paid or caused to be paid all sums payable by the Issuer and
the Guarantors under the Indenture; and

(3)   the Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee under the Indenture to apply the
deposited money toward the payment of the Notes at maturity or on the redemption date, as
the case may be.

In addition, the Issuer must deliver an Officer’s Certificate and an opinion of counsel to the Trustee
stating that all conditions precedent in the Indenture relating to satisfaction and discharge have been
satisfied; provided that any such counsel may rely on any Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact
(including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (1), (2) and (3)). If requested by the Issuer in
writing, the Trustee may distribute any amount deposited in trust to the Holders prior to the Stated
Maturity or the redemption date, as the case may be; provided, however, that the Holders shall have
received at least five Business Days’ notice from the Issuer of such earlier payment date (which may
be included in the notice of redemption).


-----

**Currency Indemnity and Calculation of Euro-denominated Restrictions**
The euro is the sole currency of account with respect to the Notes and payment for all sums payable
by the Issuer and the Guarantors under or in connection with the Notes, including damages. Any
amount received or recovered in a currency other than the euro, whether as a result of, or the
enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of
the Issuer or any Guarantor or otherwise by any Holder of a Note, as the case may be, or by the
Trustee, in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from the Issuer or any Guarantor shall only
constitute a discharge to the Issuer or any Guarantor to the extent of the euro amount which the
recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in that other currency on the
date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not practicable to make that purchase on that date, on the
first date on which it is practicable to do so).

If that euro amount is less than the euro amount expressed to be due to the recipient or the Trustee
under any Note the Issuer will indemnify them against the cost of making any such purchase. For the
purposes of this currency indemnity provision, it will be prima facie evidence of the matter stated
therein for the Holder of a Note or the Trustee to certify in reasonable detail in a manner satisfactory
to the Issuer (indicating the sources of information used) the loss it incurred in making any such
purchase. These indemnities, to the extent permitted by law, constitute a separate and independent
obligation from the Issuer’s other obligations, will give rise to a separate and independent cause of
action, will apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any Holder or the Trustee (other than a waiver
of the indemnities set out under the caption “—Currency Indemnity and Calculation of Euro_denominated Restrictions”) and will continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment, order,_
claim or proof for a liquidated amount in respect of any sum due under any Note or to the Trustee.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any
euro-denominated restriction herein, the Euro Equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is
denominated in a non-euro currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange
rate in effect on the date such non-euro amount is incurred or made, as the case may be.

**Concerning the Trustee**
The Issuer shall deliver written notice to a responsible officer of the Trustee within 30 days of
becoming aware of the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default. The Trustee will be permitted
to engage in other transactions with the Issuer and the Guarantors; however, if it acquires any
conflicting interest it must eliminate such conflict within 90 days or resign as Trustee.

The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes will have the
right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy
available to the Trustee, subject to certain exceptions. The Indenture provides that in case an Event
of Default occurs and is continuing, of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has written notice of,
the Trustee will be required, in the exercise of its power, to use the degree of care of a prudent
person in the conduct of their own affairs. Subject to such provisions, the Trustee will be under no
obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Indenture at the request of any holder of
Notes, unless such holder has offered (and if accepted, provided) to the Trustee security and/or
indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense.

The Issuer and the Guarantors jointly and severally will indemnify the Trustee for certain claims,
liabilities and expenses incurred without gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud on its part,
arising out of or in connection with its duties.

**Listing**
Application will be made to list the Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and
to admit the Notes to trading on the Euro MTF market. There can be no assurance that the
application to list the Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and to admit the
Notes for trading on the Euro MTF market will be approved and settlement of the Notes is not
conditioned on obtaining this listing.


-----

**Governing Law**
The Indenture, the Notes and the Guarantees will be governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the laws of the State of New York. The Intercreditor Agreement, Revolving Credit Facility Agreement,
the Escrow Agreement and the Escrow Charge will be governed by, and construed in accordance
with, English law. The Security and Guarantee Documents will be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, Spanish law, Portuguese law and Luxembourg law, as applicable. For the
avoidance of doubt, Articles 84 to 94-8 of the Luxembourg Act dated August 10, 1915 on commercial
companies, as amended will not be applicable to the Notes.

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service of Process**
The Indenture will provide that the Issuer and each Guarantor, will appoint Corporation Service
Company (CSC), as its authorized agent for service of process in any suit, action or proceeding with
respect to the Indenture, the Notes and the Notes Guarantees brought in any US federal or New York
state court located in the City of New York and will submit to such jurisdiction.

**Enforceability of Judgments**
Since all of the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors are outside the United States, any judgment
obtained in the United States against the Issuer or any Guarantor, may not be collectable within the
United States. See the caption “Enforcement of Civil Liabilities.”

**Prescription**
Claims against the Parent Guarantor, the Issuer or any Guarantor for the payment of principal of, or
interest, premium, or Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes will become void unless presentation
for payment is made as required in the Indenture within a period of seven years, in the case of
principal, or five years, in the case of interest, premium or Additional Amounts, if any, from the
applicable original payment date therefor.

**Certain Definitions**

the aggregate principal amount of Additional Notes issued.

“Affiliate” of any specified Person means any other Person directly or indirectly controlling or
controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with such specified Person. For purposes of
this definition, “control,” as used with respect to any Person, means the possession, directly or

shall be included as though such synergies had been achieved on the first day of the relevant

# Book-Entry; Delivery and Form

**General**
Certain defined terms used but not defined in this section have the meanings assigned to them in the
Indenture, as described in the “Description of Notes”.

Notes sold to “qualified institutional buyers” as defined in Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act
(“Rule 144A”) in reliance on Rule 144A will initially be represented by a global note in registered form
without interest coupons attached (the “Rule 144A Global Note”). Notes sold to persons outside the
United States in offshore transactions (as defined in Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act
(“Regulation S”)) in reliance on Regulation S will initially be represented by a global note in registered
form without interest coupons attached (the “Regulation S Global Note” and, together with the Rule
144A Global Note, the “Global Notes”). The Global Notes will be deposited, on the closing date, with,
or on behalf of, a common depositary and registered in the name of the nominee of the common
depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Note (“Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests”) and
ownership of interests in the Regulation S Global Note (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests” and,
together with the Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests, the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to
persons that have accounts with Euroclear and/or Clearstream or persons that hold interests through
such participants and has to be in accordance with applicable transfer restrictions set out in the
Indenture and in any applicable securities laws of any state of the United States or of any other
jurisdiction. See “Notice to U.S Investors”, “Notice to Certain European Investors” and “Notice to
_Investors”. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in the Global Notes on behalf of their_
participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their
respective depositaries. Except under the limited circumstances described below, Book-Entry
Interests will not be held in definitive certificated form.

Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records
maintained in book-entry form by Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants pursuant to
customary procedures and subject to the applicable rules and procedures established by Euroclear or
Clearstream and their respective participants. Except under the limited circumstances described
below, owners of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will not be entitled to receive definitive notes
in registered form (“Definitive Registered Notes”). Instead, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit on
their respective book-entry registration and transfer systems a participant’s account with the interest
beneficially owned by such participant. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states of the
United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such
securities in definitive certificated form. The foregoing limitations may impair the ability to own,
transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while the Notes are in global form, holders of
Book-Entry Interests will not be considered the owners or “holders” of Notes for any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable (or their
respective nominees), will be considered the sole holders of Global Notes for all purposes under the
Indenture governing the Notes. As such, participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear, Clearstream and the
participants through which they own Book-Entry Interests, to transfer their interests or to exercise any
rights of holders under the Indenture governing the Notes.

Neither the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Trustee, the Calculation Agent, any Paying Agent, the Transfer
Agent, the Registrar nor any of their respective agents will have any responsibility, or be liable, under
the Indenture governing the Notes for any aspect of the records relating to the Book-Entry Interests.

**Redemption of the Global Notes**
In the event that any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream
(or their respective nominees), as applicable, will redeem an equal amount of the Book-Entry
Interests in such Global Note from the amount received by it in respect of the redemption of such
Global Note. The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry
Interests will be equal to the amount received by Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, in


-----

connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). The Issuer understands
that, under the existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all the Notes are to be
redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their respective participants’ accounts on
a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions), by lot or on such other basis as they
deem fair and appropriate; provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest of less than €100,000
principal amount may be redeemed in part.

**Payments on Global Notes**
Payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal, premium, interest
and additional amounts) will be made by the Issuer to the Paying Agent. The Paying Agent will, in
turn, make such payments to Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable. Euroclear or Clearstream will
in turn distribute such payments to participants in accordance with its procedures. The Issuer will
make payments of all such amounts without deduction or withholding for or on account of any present
or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature except as may be
required by law.

The Issuer expects that standing customer instructions and customary practices will govern payments
by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through such participants, as is now the case
with securities held for the accounts of customers registered in “street name”. Payments by
participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the responsibility of such
participants, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of customers registered in “street
name”.

In order to tender Book-Entry Interests in a change of control offer or asset sale offer, the holder of
the applicable Global Note must, within the time period specified in such offer, give notice of such
tender to the Paying Agent and specify the principal amount of Book-Entry Interests to be tendered.

Under the terms of the Indenture governing the Notes, the Issuer, the Trustee, any Paying Agent, the
Transfer Agent and the Registrar will treat the registered holder of the Global Notes (e.g., Euroclear
or Clearstream (or their respective nominees)) as the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving
payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, none of the Issuer, the Trustee, any Paying
Agent, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar or any of its or their respective agents has or will have
any responsibility or liability for:

-    any aspect of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant
relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest or for maintaining,
supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect
participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest; or

-    Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant.

The Notes will be issued in denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess
thereof. We will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Notes; however, owners of the
Book-Entry Interest may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of
accounts in Euroclear or Clearstream.

**Currency of Payment for the Global Notes**
The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the
Global Notes will be paid in euro. Payments will be subject in all cases to any fiscal or other laws and
regulations (including any regulations of the applicable clearing system) applicable thereto.

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**
Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that they will take any action permitted to be
taken by a holder of Notes (including the presentation of Notes for exchange as described above)
only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests in the
Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of
Notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction. Euroclear and
Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the taking of any
other action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is an event of default under the Notes,


-----

Euroclear and Clearstream reserve the right to exchange the Global Notes for Definitive Registered
Notes, and to distribute Definitive Registered Notes to its participants.

**Transfers**
Transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in accordance with
Euroclear and Clearstream rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder
requires physical delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell Notes to
persons in states which require physical delivery of securities or to pledge such securities, such
holder must transfer its interests in the Global Notes in accordance with the normal procedures of
Euroclear and Clearstream and in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture.

The Rule 144A Global Note will have a legend to the effect set forth under “Notice to Investors”.
Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers and
certification requirements discussed under “Notice to Investors”.

Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a
Regulation S Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the
form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with
Regulation S or Rule 144 under the U.S. Securities Act or any other exemption (if available under the
U.S. Securities Act).

Through and including the 40th day after the later of the commencement of the offering of the Notes
and the closing of the offering (the “40-day period”), Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be
transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Rule 144A Book-Entry Interest
denominated in the same currency only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the
form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the
transferor reasonably believes is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A in a
transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer
restrictions described under “Notice to Investors” and in accordance with any applicable securities
laws of any other jurisdiction.

After the expiration of the 40-day Period, beneficial interests in a Regulation S Global Note may be
transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a beneficial interest in the Rule 144A Global
Note without compliance with these certification requirements.

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for a Rule
144A Book-Entry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal
amount of the Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the
Rule 144A Global Note.

Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery
in the form of a Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a BookEntry Interest in the first- mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in such other
Global Note, and accordingly will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other
procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it remains
such a Book-Entry Interest.

**Definitive Registered Notes**
Under the terms of the Indenture governing the Notes, owners of the Book-Entry Interests will receive
Definitive Registered Notes only in the following circumstances:

-    if Euroclear or Clearstream notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as
depositary and a successor depositary is not appointed by the Issuer within 120 days; or

-    if the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through
Euroclear or Clearstream following an Event of Default which results in action by the Trustee
pursuant to the enforcement provisions under the Indenture.

Euroclear has advised the Issuer that upon request by an owner of a Book-Entry Interest described
above, its current procedure is to request that Definitive Registered Notes be issued to all owners of
Book-Entry Interests and not only to the owner who made the initial request.


-----

In any such events described above, the Registrar will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered
in the name or names, and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of
Euroclear and/or Clearstream (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and certain
certification requirements and based upon directions received from participants reflecting the
beneficial ownership of the Book-Entry Interests). The Definitive Registered Notes will bear a
restrictive legend with respect to certain transfer restrictions, unless that legend is not required by the
Indenture or by applicable law.

In the case of the issuance of Definitive Registered Notes, the holder of a Definitive Registered Note
may transfer such note by surrendering it to the registrar or a transfer agent. In the event of a partial
transfer or a partial redemption of a holding of Definitive Registered Notes represented by one
Definitive Registered Note, a Definitive Registered Note will be issued to the transferee in respect of
the part transferred and a new Definitive Registered Note in respect of the balance of the holding not
transferred or redeemed will be issued to the transferor or the holder, as applicable; provided that no
Definitive Registered Note in a denomination less than €100,000 will be issued. The Issuer will bear
the cost of preparing, printing, packaging and delivering the Definitive Registered Notes.

The Issuer will not be required to register the transfer or exchange of Definitive Registered Notes for
a period of 15 calendar days preceding (i) the record date for any payment of interest on the Notes;
(ii) any date fixed for redemption of the Notes; or (iii) the date fixed for selection of the Notes to be
redeemed in part. Also, the Issuer is not required to register the transfer or exchange of any Notes
selected for redemption or which the holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in
connection with a change of control offer or asset sale offer. In the event of the transfer of any
Definitive Registered Note, the trustee may require a holder, among other things, to furnish
appropriate endorsements and transfer documents as described in the Indenture. The Issuer may
require a holder to pay any transfer taxes and fees required by law and permitted by the Indenture
and the Notes.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such a Definitive Registered
Note has been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, or if such Definitive Registered Note is mutilated
and is surrendered to the registrar or at the office of a transfer agent, the Issuer will issue and the
Trustee will authenticate a replacement Definitive Registered Note if the Trustee’s and the Issuer’s
requirements are met. The Issuer or the Trustee may require a holder requesting replacement of a
Definitive Registered Note to furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of both to protect
themselves, the Trustee or the Paying Agent appointed pursuant to the Indenture from any loss which
any of them may suffer if a Definitive Registered Note is replaced. The Issuer may charge for its
expenses incurred in replacing a Definitive Registered Note.

In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is
about to become due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by the Issuer pursuant
to the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer, in its discretion, may, instead of issuing a new Definitive
Registered Note, pay, redeem or purchase such Definitive Registered Note, as the case may be.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global
Note only in accordance with the Indenture and, if required, only after the transferor first delivers to
the trustee a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer
will comply with the transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes. See “Notice to Investors”.

So long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules
of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer will publish a notice of any issuance of
Definitive Registered Notes in a newspaper having general circulation in the Grand Duchy of
Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger Wort). Payment of principal, any repurchase
price, premium and interest on Definitive Registered Notes will be payable at the office of the Paying
Agent in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg or at the registered office of the Issuer so long as the
Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require.

**Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream**
All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and
Clearstream, as applicable. The Issuer provides the following summaries of those operations and


-----

procedures solely for the convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each
settlement system are controlled by that settlement system and may be changed at any time. Neither
the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustees, any Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent nor the
Registrar nor any of their respective agents are responsible for those operations or procedures.

The Issuer understands as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream. Euroclear and
Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They also facilitate the clearance and
settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic bookentry changes in accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services
to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and
borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic
securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as
underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations.
Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers,
dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodian relationship with a Euroclear
or Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf
of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge
such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or
otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate
for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of
securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons
may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream
systems will receive distributions attributable to the 144A Global Notes only through Euroclear or
Clearstream participants.

**Global Clearance and Settlement Under the Book-Entry System**
The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be listed on the Official List of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on the Euro MTF market. Transfers of interests
in the Global Notes between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary
way in accordance with their respective rules and operating procedures.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate
transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case
may be, they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such
procedures may be discontinued or modified at any time. None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the
Transfer Agent, the Registrar or any Paying Agent nor any of their respective agents will have any
responsibility for the performance by Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective participants or
indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their
operations.

**Initial Settlement**
Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in Euros. Book-Entry Interests owned through Euroclear
or Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional bonds in
registered form. Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear
and Clearstream holders on the business day following the settlement date against payment for value
of the settlement date.

**Secondary Market Trading**
The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear or Clearstream and will settle in
same-day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at
the time of trading of any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts
are located to ensure that settlement can be made on the desired value date.

# Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations

**European Union Insolvency**
The Issuer and the Guarantors are incorporated and/or organized under the laws of Member States
of the European Union.

From June 26, 2017, the new Regulation 2015/848, of the European Parliament and of the Council,
of May 20, 2015, on insolvency proceedings (recast) (“Regulation 2015/848”) is applicable to all EU
countries except Denmark. This means that this new regulation shall be applicable to all those
insolvency proceedings that are initiated in a EU country (except Denmark), when the centre of main
interest (“COMI”) of the debtor is located in a EU country (except Denmark) instead of Regulation
(EC) 1346/2000.

In addition to the new information duties between the countries (e.g. such countries must create an
insolvency registry), Regulation 2015/848 introduced the following measures:

(a)   The type of proceedings to which this regulation applies (foreseen under Annex A of Regulation
2015/848) has increased, and pre-insolvency proceedings are now included. With regards to
Spain, Regulation 2015/848 includes homologation proceedings, extrajudicial payment
proceedings, or anticipated arrangement proposals and with regards to Portugal includes the
“processo especial de revitalização”.

(b)   The determination on the judicial competence to declare the principal insolvency proceeding is
explained in more detail. In this sense, the definition of COMI is now set out under article 3,
which states that the COMI shall be the place where the debtor conducts the administration of
its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties. In the case of a
company or legal person, the place of the registered office shall be presumed to be the COMI
in the absence of proof to the contrary. That presumption shall only apply if the registered office
has not been moved to another Member State within the three-month period prior to the
request for the opening of insolvency proceedings.

(c)   A new chapter on the insolvency of companies that belong to the same group has been
included. Regulation 2015/848 aims to ensure that more cooperation and coordination among
insolvency receivers, courts and other entities in charge of each proceeding, and has even
included a new proceeding called “group coordination proceeding”, which is voluntary and
enables the insolvency proceedings of group companies to be processed jointly.

If the COMI of a company is in one Member State (other than Denmark) under Article 3(2) of the EU
Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to
open insolvency proceedings against that company only if such company has an “establishment” in
the territory of such other Member State. An “establishment” is defined as any place of operations
where a debtor carries out or has carried out in the 3-month period prior to the request to open main
insolvency proceedings on non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets. The
effects of those insolvency proceedings opened in that other Member State are restricted to the
assets of the company situated in such other Member State.

Where main proceedings have been opened in the Member State in which the company has its
COMI, any proceedings opened subsequently in another Member State in which the company has an
establishment shall be secondary proceedings. Where main proceedings in the Member State in
which the company has its COMI have not yet been opened, territorial insolvency proceedings can be
opened in another Member State where the company has an establishment only where either: (a)
insolvency proceedings cannot be opened in the Member State in which the company’s COMI is
situated under that Member State’s law; or (b) the opening of territorial insolvency proceedings is
requested by:


-----

i.    a creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection with the operation of an establishment
situated within the territory of the Member State where the opening of territorial proceedings is
requested; or

ii.    a public authority which, under the law of the Member State within the territory of which the
establishment is situated, has the right to request the opening of insolvency proceedings.

When main insolvency proceedings are opened, the territorial insolvency proceedings shall become
secondary insolvency proceedings.

Any judgment opening insolvency proceedings handed down by a court of a Member State which has
jurisdiction pursuant to Article 3 shall be recognized in all other Member States from the moment that
it becomes effective in the Member State of the opening of proceedings. This shall also apply where,
on account of a debtor’s capacity, insolvency proceedings cannot be brought against that debtor in
other Member States.

Recognition of main proceedings shall not preclude the opening of a secondary proceeding. The
liquidator appointed by a court in a Member State that has jurisdiction to open main proceedings
(because the company’s centre of main interests is there) may exercise the powers conferred on him
by the law of that Member State in another Member State (such as to remove assets of the company
from that other Member State), subject to certain limitations, so long as no insolvency proceedings
have been opened in that other Member State or any preservation measure taken to the contrary
further to a request to open insolvency proceedings in that other Member State where the company
has assets.

**Spain**

**_Spanish Insolvency Laws_**
Under Spanish insolvency law, your right to receive payments of interest and principal on the Notes in
case of insolvency may be more limited than would be the case under U.S. bankruptcy laws.

The Spanish Insolvency Law 22/2003, as amended, governs certain out-of court restructurings or
refinancings and court insolvency proceedings. This section summarizes the main aspects of Spanish
insolvency law affecting corporations, and not individuals, as there are certain specialties for the
insolvency of the latest.

The Spanish Insolvency Law foresees a pre-insolvency mechanism whereby the debtor may file the
communication foreseen under Article 5 bis which provides him with a total of four additional months
to reach an agreement with its main creditors and avoid filing for insolvency. The main effect of filing
the 5 bis communication is that during the four-month period all enforcement proceedings against the
debtor regarding necessary assets for the debtor’s activity are suspended, and no enforcement
proceedings can be filed against the debtor either, at least until: (i) a refinancing agreement foreseen
under article 71 bis 1 of the Spanish Insolvency Law is agreed on; (ii) a ruling from the court
admitting the application to homologate a refinancing agreement is issued; (iii) an extrajudicial
payment agreement is reached; (iv) enough adhesions to an anticipated arrangement proposal are
obtained; or (v) the insolvency proceeding has been declared. These exceptions are not applicable to
enforcement proceedings regarding credits of public authorities. Enforcement proceedings regarding
security may be filed but will be immediately suspended at least until any of the aforementioned
scenarios takes place.

Spanish insolvency law also foresees under Additional Provision IV the possibility of a debtor to
homologate a refinancing agreement with its financial creditors. The main effect of this type of
agreement is that it foresees cramming down mechanisms if certain majorities are met, and that the
agreement cannot be subject to claw back actions. In this regard, pursuant to the homologacion of a
refinancing agreement (i) stays of payments of up to 10 years, (ii) any discharge of debt, (iii)
conversion of debts into equity of the refinanced debtor, (iv) conversion of debts into profit
participating loans (préstamos participativos) with a term of up to 10 years and (v) transfer of assets
or rights to the creditors in payment for all or part of their debt can be extended to creditors holding
financial liabilities.


-----

Under current Spanish insolvency law, a debtor shall apply for an insolvency proceeding, which are
known as “concurso de acreedores” when it is not able to meet its current obligations or when it
expects that it will shortly be unable to do so (unless the company has made a pre-insolvency filing in
accordance with Article 5 bis that allows for a four-month period to close a refinancing agreement
with its creditors as previously explained). The filing of such declaration of insolvency may be
requested by the debtor, any creditor thereof and the mediator, the latter only when an out-of-court
payment process has taken place before. If filed by the debtor, the insolvency is deemed “voluntary”
(concurso voluntario) and, if filed by a creditor, the insolvency is deemed “mandatory” (concurso
_necesario). In the case of voluntary insolvency, as a general rule, the debtor still maintains the_
management and full powers of disposal over its assets, although it is subject to the intervention
(intervención) of the insolvency administrator (administrador concursal) or administrators, as
applicable. In the case of mandatory insolvency, as a general rule, the debtor’s management powers
are suspended, and management’s former power, including the power to dispose of assets, is
conferred solely upon the insolvency administrators (sustitución). The time between the petition and
the insolvency declaration by the court will depend upon a number of factors, including whether the
filing has been made by the debtor or the creditor (and, in turn, whether the debtor has challenged
the petition made by the creditor), whether all appropriate documentation has been submitted on a
timely basis or is incomplete, and the workload of the court.

Creditors may apply for a joint insolvency declaration of two or more of its debtors if either (i) the
assets of the relevant debtor are commingled, or (ii) they form part of the same group of companies.
Therefore, the request for the joint insolvency of two or more legal entities may only be filed by a
common creditor of the relevant companies and each of the affected companies must in fact be
separately insolvent. Joint insolvency may also be requested by the companies themselves, provided
that they form part of the same group. Any of the insolvent debtors, or any of the insolvency
administrators, as the case may be, may apply for the accumulation of insolvency proceedings
already declared under certain circumstances (and, in particular, if the insolvent debtors form part of
the same group of companies). In addition, creditors may apply for the accumulation of the insolvency
proceedings of two or more of its debtors already declared if either (i) the assets of the relevant
debtor are commingled, (ii) they form part of the same group of companies, or (iii) they are managers,
shareholders, partners or members personally liable for the debts of the debtor if it is a legal entity,
_provided that a petition has not been submitted by any of the insolvent debtors or by the insolvency_
administrators. Insolvency proceedings declared jointly or accumulated are processed in coordination,
without consolidation of the estate of the insolvent debtors. As a result, and as a general rule, a
“group insolvency” does not lead to a commingling of the debtors’ assets and creditors of such group.
This means that the creditors of one company of the group will not have recourse against other
companies of the same group (except where cross-guarantees exist). The current system is basically
a procedural one, aimed at making the insolvency proceedings as time and cost efficient as possible.
However, exceptionally, and for the purpose of the drafting of the insolvency report by the insolvency
administrators only, assets and liabilities amongst the companies declared insolvent may be
consolidated where there is a confusion of states, and assets and liabilities belonging to each of the
companies cannot be identified.

The general principle of “no termination effect” is established such that all agreements remain
effective at the time of the insolvency. Therefore, the declaration of insolvency does not impair the
existence of the contracts entered into by the debtor, which would remain in force. Any contractual
arrangements establishing the termination of a contract and/or entitling the relevant creditor to
terminate it in the event of the declaration of insolvency of the debtor will be unenforceable.

As a general rule, the declaration of insolvency does not alter the general contractual rules on
termination, but under the Spanish Insolvency Law, the judge may decide to remedy an eventual
default of the insolvent party by reinstating an agreement, with the effect that any outstanding
amounts and further payments under the agreement will be post-insolvency claims. If the court
deems it appropriate for the interests of the insolvent party, it is also entitled to terminate an
agreement, with compensation for damages if it deems it is best for the insolvency proceeding. There
are specific rules for employment agreements, mainly affecting collective dismissals, which are dealt
with by the insolvency judge.

There is a two-year clawback period starting backward from the date on which insolvency is declared,
although transactions within that period will not automatically become void as a result of the initiation


-----

of insolvency proceedings but instead the insolvency administrators must expressly challenge those
transactions. Also, creditors who have applied to exercise any clawback action (stating the specific
action they aim to contest or revoke and their grounds), shall be entitled to exercise such action if the
insolvency administrators do not do so within the two months following their request. Under such
clawback action, acts detrimental (perjudiciales) to the debtor’s estate carried out during the two
years prior to the date the insolvency is declared may be rescinded, regardless of fraudulent intention
(transactions taking place earlier than two years before insolvency has been declared are subject to
the general regime of rescission). Acts where no consideration is received for a disposed asset and
acts that result in the early repayment or settlements of obligations which would have become due
after the declaration of insolvency (unless such obligations were secured by means of an in rem
security) are deemed detrimental, and this is a non-rebuttable presumption. In addition, unless the
debtor or another affected party (such as a creditor) can prove otherwise to the court’s satisfaction, a
disposal made in favor of a “related person or entity” (as detailed in the following paragraph) as well
as the creation of a security interest securing a preexisting obligation or a new obligation that
replaces an existing one, and those payments or other acts extinguishing obligations that would have
become due after the declaration of insolvency and which are secured by means of an in rem
security, are presumed to be detrimental, and this is a rebuttable presumption. In the case of actions
not covered by the presumptions above, the burden of proof is on the person bringing the action of
rescission. Acts deriving from the debtor’s ordinary course of business made at arm’s length and
certain refinancing arrangements (acuerdos de refinanciación) meeting certain legal requirements set
forth in Article 71 bis of the Spanish Insolvency Law, and, as applicable, the Fourth Additional
Provisions of the Spanish Insolvency Law, as well as the business, acts and payments made in the
ordinary course of business and the security created in connection therewith, may not be rescinded.
According to the latest Spanish Supreme Court case law, intra-group guarantees are not free of
charge transactions when, in exchange for providing the said guarantees, the guaranteed creditor
undertakes to provide something in exchange. In this regard, the latest case law applies a
presumption that contextual intra-group guarantees that are provided at the same time as the
guaranteed financing are not free of charge transactions (although this presumption vanishes if it is
evidenced that the guarantee was spontaneously granted). On the other hand, if an intra-group
guarantee benefiting a third party was granted after the obligation arose (whereby it would not be
contextual), the guarantee would be considered a free of charge transaction unless there is evidence
that the guarantee was granted in exchange for a consideration or advantage. For these purposes,
this benefit or compensation does not have to be a payment or direct capital allocation, but rather it
may consist of an indirect benefit for the guarantor.

In the case of a legal entity, the following shall be deemed to be “related person”: (i) shareholders
with unlimited liability; (ii) limited liability shareholders holding 10% or more of the insolvent
company’s share capital (or 5% if the company is listed) by the time the credit right under dispute in
the insolvency scenario arises; (iii) directors (including shadow directors), liquidators and those
holding general powers of attorney from the insolvent company, as well as such individuals holding
such positions within two years prior to the declaration of insolvency; and (iv) companies pertaining to
the same group as the debtor and their common shareholders provided such shareholders meet the
minimum shareholding requirements set forth in (ii) above. In addition, it is established the rebuttable
presumption that the assignees of the above are also “specially related persons” if the assignment
has occurred within two years prior to the declaration of insolvency.

In any event, set-off is prohibited unless the requirements for the set-off were satisfied prior to the
declaration of insolvency or the claim of the insolvent is governed by a law that permits set-off.

The current Spanish Insolvency Law makes a distinction between general debts under insolvency
proceedings and debts against the insolvency estate (créditos contra la masa). Debts against the
insolvency estate, which include, among others, (i) certain amounts of the employee payroll, (ii) costs
and expenses of the insolvency proceedings, (iii) certain amounts arising from services provided by
the insolvent debtor under reciprocal contracts and outstanding obligations that remain in force after
insolvency proceedings are declared and deriving from obligations to return and indemnify in cases of
voluntary termination or breach by the insolvent debtor, (iv) those that derive from the exercise of a
clawback action within the insolvency proceedings of acts performed by the insolvent debtor and
correspond to a refund of consideration received by it (except in cases of bad faith), (v) certain
amounts arising from obligations created by law or from the non-contractual liability of the insolvent
debtor after the declaration of insolvency and until its conclusion, (vi) 50% of the funds lent under a


-----

refinancing arrangement entered into in compliance with the requirements set forth in Article 71 bis or
Additional Provision IV of the Spanish Insolvency Law and (vii) certain debts incurred by the debtor
following the declaration of insolvency, are not considered part of the debtor’s general debt and are
payable when due according to their own terms (and, therefore, are paid before other debts under
insolvency proceedings).

The Spanish Insolvency Law procedure includes a common phase (during which, among others,
insolvency administrators are appointed, an inventory of the assets and a list of creditors is prepared
and claims ranked, as detailed below) and three potential results: (i) a composition agreement
between the creditors and the debtor (“CVA”), (ii) the debtor’s liquidation or (iii) termination of the
proceedings due to a debtor’s overcoming its insolvency.

A CVA may be entered into between the debtor and the majority of the creditors involving a delay in
payment, partial cancellation of debts, partial conversion of debts into equity of the insolvent debtor,
convertible bonds, subordinated loans, profit participating loans, PIK loans or any other different
financing instrument with a different ranking, maturity or any other different features than the financing
instruments previously held by the relevant creditor. It is not effective until the court gives its approval.
The court may refuse to do so when there has been a breach of the law or when the parties have
shown that the debtor will not be able to fulfill the arrangement. The arrangement may be imposed on
ordinary or subordinated creditors but also on secured creditors if certain majorities are met within
categories. For this purpose the Spanish Insolvency Law divides secured creditors and creditors with
a general priority into four categories: (a) employees; (b) public authority creditors; (c) financial
creditors (regardless of whether they are supervised by a regulatory body such as the Bank of
Spain); and (d) any other creditors – mainly commercial creditors.

Although upon approval of the arrangement most of the effects of the insolvency proceedings cease,
strictly speaking the proceedings do not terminate until the terms of the arrangement are completely
fulfilled.

In the case of liquidation, the debtor ceases to manage its assets (in the case of a company, its
directors would cease to act), and is replaced with the court receiver. The court receiver liquidates the
debtor’s assets by selling them to distribute the money obtained among the creditors according to the
priority rules established by the Spanish Insolvency Law (as explained below). For these purposes a
liquidation plan is produced by the court receiver and approved by the Insolvency Judge (creditors
may provide comments and suggestions to the relevant plan).

Article 176.4 of the Spanish Insolvency Law also foresees the termination of the insolvency
proceeding at any stage when it is proven that all credits have been paid, or that all creditors have
been entirely satisfied by other means, or that the situation of insolvency (i.e. the impossibility to face
payment obligations regularly) has been overcome.

Finally, it must be noted that article 176 bis of the Spanish Insolvency Law foresees the termination of
the insolvency proceeding at any time when no future claw back actions are envisaged, nor actions
claiming liability to third parties, nor the assessment of the proceeding as guilty, and the current
assets are not enough to pay post insolvency debt.

Upon a filing for insolvency proceedings, the court issues an insolvency order containing an express
request for the creditors of the insolvent debtor to declare all debts owed to them by the debtor,
providing documentation to justify such debts, within a period of one month from the publication in the
Spanish Official Gazette (BOE). Based on the documentation provided by the creditors and
documentation held by the debtor, the court receivers draw up a list of acknowledged creditors and
classify them according to the categories established under law:

-    Debts benefiting from special privileges (“créditos con privilegio especial”), representing
security on certain assets (in essence, security). For the purposes of Article 90.3, the value of
the collateral constituted to secure the claims that have special preference shall be stated. To
determine this, the debts pending that have a preferential security on the same asset shall be
deducted from the nine tenths of the fair value of the asset or right on which the security is
created, without the value of the security being lower than zero in any case, nor exceeding the
value of the preferential credit or the value of the maximum mortgage or pledge liability that
has been agreed.


-----

For these exclusive purposes, fair value is construed as:

a)    In the case of securities listed on an official secondary market, or on another regulated
market, or money market instruments, the average weighted price at which they have
been negotiated on one or several regulated markets in the last quarter prior to the date
of declaration opening the insolvency proceedings, pursuant to the certification issued by
the company governing the concerned official secondary market or the regulated market.

b)    In the case of real estate, that resulting from the report issued by a recognized appraisal
company registered with the Special Register of the Bank of Spain.

c)    In the case of assets or rights other than those stated in the preceding paragraphs, that
resulting from a report issued by an independent expert pursuant to the generally
accepted principles and rules of valuation recognized for such assets.

-    These privileges may entail separate proceedings, subject to certain restrictions derived from a
waiting period that may last up to one year. In general terms, privileged creditors are not
subject to the CVA, except if they give their express support by voting in favor of the
restructuring arrangement or certain qualified majorities are met. In the event of liquidation,
they are the first to collect payment against the assets on which their debt is secured.

However, the insolvency administrator has the option to halt any enforcement of the security
and pay these claims under specific payment rules.

-    Debts benefiting from general privileges (“créditos con privilegio general”) including, among
others, labor and public debts. General privileges for public debt, other than debt relating to tax
withholdings and certain social security obligations, are recognized for half of the amount of the
debt. General privileges are also recognized for half of the amount of debt held by the first
creditor to apply for the insolvency proceedings of the debtor. Funds lent under a refinancing
arrangement entered into in compliance with the requirements set forth in Article 71.6 of the
Spanish Insolvency Law in the amount not admitted as a debt against the insolvency estate
shall be also considered as debts with general privileges. Creditors whose debt benefits from
general privileges are not affected by CVA provided that they do not agree to it or that certain
majorities are not met, and, in the event of liquidation, they are the first to collect payment, in
the order established under law and out of the non-charged assets of the insolvent debtor once
all claims against the estate have been settled.

-    Ordinary debts (non-subordinated and non-privileged creditors). Creditors of ordinary debt
(“créditos ordinarios”) will be paid after creditors benefiting from special or general privileges on
a pro rata basis vis à vis each other.

-    Subordinated debts (classified as such by virtue of the underlying credit agreement or pursuant
to law). Subordinated debts (“créditos subordinados”) include, among others, debts
communicated late (outside the specific one-month period mentioned above), credits that are
contractually subordinated vis-à-vis all other credits of the debtor; credits relating to surcharge
and unpaid interest claims (including default interest) except for those credits secured with an
_in rem right up to the secured amount; fines, debts held by “specially related persons”, as_
explained above, claims resulting from acts that were set aside where the creditor was
declared in the judgment to have acted in bad faith; and certain credits deriving from contracts
with reciprocal obligations if the creditor attempts to prevent the fulfillment of the contract to the
detriment of the insolvency interests. Subordinated creditors are not entitled to vote on the CVA
and in practice usually have very limited chances of collection, as a result of the ranking
established by law.

Under the current Spanish Insolvency Law, the intercompany loans between Bidco and Empark and
between Bidco and the Issuer would be treated as subordinated debt.

_Applicable jurisdiction_
The applicable jurisdiction to conduct an insolvency proceeding is the one in which the insolvent party
has its COMI. This COMI is deemed to be where the insolvent party conducts the administration of its
interests on a regular basis and which may be recognized as such by third parties (although under
European Union and Spanish law there is a presumption that a debtor’s COMI is located where its


-----

registered address is). Insolvency proceedings conducted by the court of the COMI are considered
“the principal insolvency proceedings” and have universal reach affecting all the assets of the
insolvent party worldwide. If the COMI is not in Spain, but the insolvent party has a permanent
establishment in Spain, Spanish courts will only have jurisdiction over the assets located in Spain (the
“territorial insolvency proceedings”).

In the event that any of the Guarantors becomes insolvent and is subject to the current Spanish
Insolvency Law, its Guarantee will be treated as ordinary debt unless it is either (a) secured; or (b)
subordinated by application of any of the criteria indicated above. In addition, creditors may seek
repayment directly from the insolvent entity’s directors or shadow directors if a court determines that
the insolvency resulted from their negligence (concurso culpable).

In this respect, please note that the proceedings to characterize the insolvency as guilty
(characterization proceedings) only commence: (i) in insolvencies where the company is liquidated, in
all cases, and (ii) in insolvencies which conclude with an arrangement being reached, only when this
imposes a debt reduction of more than one third and a moratorium of debt in excess of three years.

The characterization proceedings start with the allegations of the interested parties, followed by the
reports of the insolvency receivers and the public prosecutor. If either of these two bodies proposes
characterizing the insolvency as ‘negligent’, the procedure will continue in relation to the people who
the former has identified as being affected by the characterization, who are summonsed at that time,
so that they may make allegations and present evidence. After the hearing, the insolvency
characterization proceedings conclude with the characterization (assessment) of the insolvency as
‘fortuitous’ or ‘negligent’, by virtue of the judgment.

In order for an insolvency to be characterized as ‘negligent’, serious fraud or negligence on the part
of the debtor or its directors or shadow directors must be detected. However, the law also establishes
assumptions of negligence with regard to the insolvency. Some assumptions do not admit proof to the
contrary (e.g. substantial irregularities in the accounting, serious inaccuracies in the documents
submitted with the application, concealment of assets); whereas others do admit proof to the contrary
(e.g. breach of the legal duties to apply for the declaration of insolvency, to approve annual accounts
or to collaborate with the insolvency receivers, or refusing to capitalize credits without just cause).

If the insolvency is characterized as ‘negligent’, the people affected by this characterization will be
barred from acting as directors and will lose any rights they may have in the insolvency proceedings.

If the insolvency is classified as ‘negligent’ and concludes with the company’s liquidation, the
directors may also be sentenced to pay the company’s debts that have not been settled with the
proceeds obtained from the company´s liquidation, in full or in part. This exceptional provision only
seems to apply where the directors have acted with malice or serious negligence and damage
derives for the creditors from said action. However, because the legal wording is vague, it causes
great uncertainty.

Liability in the context of an insolvency extends, as in the commercial context, to the directors and
shadow directors, with the latter being understood as those individuals who, with no formal
designation, exercise the authority corresponding to the members of the company’s management
body (which entails a transfer of duties, without their prior appointment for this purpose).

Furthermore, in the context of an insolvency, anyone who held the post of director in the two years
prior to the declaration of insolvency can be held liable, provided that the events that led to the
characterization of the insolvency can be attributed to them.

In order to ensure this liability, from the time insolvency is declared, the judge of the insolvency
proceedings may order, at his or her own initiative or at the justified request of the insolvency
receivers, as a precautionary measure, the seizure of assets and rights of the company’s directors
and shadow directors, attorneys and any other parties holding this post during the two years prior to
the date of declaration of insolvency, when the actions justify the possibility that, in the judgment on
the insolvency characterization proceedings, the persons affected by the seizure of assets may be
ordered to cover the deficit resulting from the liquidation.

Finally, shareholders may also be found liable for refusing to capitalize credits without just cause.


-----

_Moratorium_
Current Spanish insolvency law imposes a moratorium on the enforcement of secured creditor’s
rights (in rem security) in the event of insolvency. The moratorium would take effect following the
declaration of insolvency until the earlier of (i) one year from the declaration of the insolvency if the
insolvent company has not been placed in liquidation or (ii) the date the creditors reach an agreement
that does not affect the exercise of the rights granted by the security interest, with the limitations
explained above. This moratorium only affects those assets that are considered as necessary for the
debtor´s activity.

In this regard, shares or stakes in companies intended exclusively for holding assets and liabilities
necessary for its financing shall not be considered necessary to continue the activity, as long as
enforcement of the security created on these does not give rise to a cause of resolution or
amendment of the contractual relations that allow the insolvent debtor to maintain operation of the
asset.

Additionally, once the insolvency proceedings are open, singular, judicial or extrajudicial enforcements
may not be initiated, nor may administrative or tax demands for payment to be collected coercively
against the assets of the debtor be continued.

As a general rule, insolvency proceedings are not compatible with other enforcement proceedings.
When compatible, in order to protect the interests of the debtor and creditors, the Spanish Insolvency
Law extends the jurisdiction of the court dealing with insolvency proceedings, which is then legally
authorized to handle any enforcement proceedings or interim measures affecting the debtor’s assets
(whether based upon civil, labor or administrative law).

Creditors holding security over an asset of the insolvent party may seek its enforcement after the
declaration of insolvency, unless the asset over which security is created is considered “necessary”
for its business activities. In that case, creditors may seek to obtain a declaration of the Insolvency
Judge confirming that the relevant asset is not considered “necessary” for its business activities.
Otherwise, they will not be able to seek enforcement until an arrangement is approved whose content
does not affect the exercise of this right, or until one year has elapsed from the declaration of
insolvency without an arrangement being approved or the liquidation stage having commenced.

The one year moratorium does not apply to financial collateral considered as such under Royal
Decree 5/2005, dated 11 March. In any event, Royal Decree 5/2005 will not always be applicable to
financial collateral. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes—The Notes will be secured only
_to up to the lesser of (a) the extent of the value of the Collateral that has been granted as security_
_for the Notes and the Note Guarantees and (b) the maximum guaranteed or secured amount, and_
_such security may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations under the Notes and the Note_
_Guarantees”._

In the case of security, an enforcement proceeding may resume if the judge in charge of the
insolvency proceeding renders an order declaring that the secured asset is not necessary for the
debtor’s activity, and also once the one-year moratorium has elapsed and none of the
aforementioned scenarios have taken place. However, once the liquidation stage has begun, secured
creditors will not be able to initiate separate enforcement proceedings and the secured asset will form
part of the collective enforcement proceeding although the proceeds obtained from the enforcement
of the charged asset will be paid to the relevant secured creditors.

_Limited history_
Finally, please note that the current Spanish Insolvency Law came into effect in September 2004, and
as such, there is only a relatively limited history of its application by Spanish courts and with limited
high court resolutions about it.

**Limitation on validity and enforcement of Guarantees and Collateral granted by any Spanish**
**Guarantor**
Under Spanish law, claims may become time-barred (five years being the general term established
for obligations in personam under Article 1,964 of the Spanish Civil Code (Código Civil)) or may be or
become subject to the defense of set-off or counterclaim.


-----

The terms “enforceable”, “enforceability”, “valid”, “legal”, “binding” and “effective” (or any combination
thereof) mean that all of the obligations assumed by the relevant party under the relevant documents
are of a type enforced by Spanish courts; the terms do not mean that these obligations will
necessarily be enforced in all circumstances in accordance with their terms. Enforcement before the
courts will in any event be subject to:

-    the nature of the remedies available in the courts; and

-    the availability of defenses such as (without limitation) set-off (unless validly waived) or
counter-claim, circumvention of law (fraude de ley), abuse of rights (abuso de derecho),
misrepresentation, force majeure, unforeseen circumstances, undue influence, duress, and
abatement

In general terms, under Spanish law, any guarantee, pledge or mortgage must guarantee or secure
another obligation to which it is ancillary, which must be clearly identified in the relevant guarantee or
security agreement. Therefore, the guarantee or security interest follows the underlying obligation in
such a way that nullity of the underlying obligation entails nullity of the guarantee or security and
termination of the underlying obligation entails termination of the guarantee or security. In the event
that the security providers are able to prove that there are no existing and valid guaranteed
obligations, Spanish courts may consider that the security providers’ obligations under the relevant
guarantees or securities are not enforceable.

Following the amendment of paragraph 6 of section 1 article 90 of the Spanish Insolvency Law (Ley
_22/2003 de 9 de julio) effective from October 22, 2015, registering pledges over future credit rights_
(prenda de derechos de credito futuros) is only a requirement for non possessory liens. In the case of
possessory pledges over future credit rights, the pledge is valid in order to have a credit with a
special privilege if it is documented in a notarial deed, if the future credit rights derive from
agreements or juridical relations that have been created prior to the declaration of insolvency, and
(only in the case of credit rights that derive from the termination of concession agreements), if the
requirements foreseen under Public Sector regulation are met.

Spanish law prohibits financial assistance within the meaning of Article 150 of the Spanish
Companies Act in relation to any Spanish guarantor incorporated or organized as a public limited
company (“sociedad anónima”) under the laws of Spain or Article 143.2 of the Spanish Companies
Act in relation to any Spanish guarantor incorporated or organized as a private limited liability
company (“sociedad limitada”) under the laws of Spain. Therefore, any guarantee, security or
indemnity granted or assumed by the Spanish Guarantors shall not extend to any payment obligation
incurred for the purpose of acquiring the shares or participations of such Guarantor or the shares of
its direct or indirect parent company or, in the case of a private limited liability company, of any
company within its group. Guarantees, security or indemnities granted in breach of financial
assistance limitations can be considered null and void, and can result in the imposition of fines to the
relevant directors of the companies committing the infraction. All provisions of such Guarantee shall
be construed accordingly in the sense that in no case can any Guarantee or security given by the
Guarantor secure repayment of the amounts used for these purposes, i.e. amounts used to finance
the Acquisition and related fees and costs.

The security interests in the Collateral that will secure the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes
will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes but will be granted only in favor of the Trustee.
It should be noted that the concepts of trust and the parallel debt concept are not recognized in
Spain. The Indenture will provide (along with the Intercreditor Agreement) that only the Security Agent
has the right to enforce the Security and Guarantee Documents. As a consequence, holders of the
Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement action in
respect of the Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Trustee, who will (subject to the
provisions of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement) provide instructions to the Security Agent
in respect of the Collateral. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if enforcement of any security interest in
Spain was to be carried out by the Security Agent in Spain, it may be necessary (i) that each of the
secured parties benefiting from such Collateral prove its title to the secured obligations, ratify such
Collateral and accept the benefit of the security interest in their respective names and (ii) to prove
that the Security Agent is duly and expressly empowered by means of duly notarized powers of
attorney granted in favor of the Security Agent by each of the actual or future creditors, if necessary,
with the Apostille of The Hague Convention dated October 5, 1961. Therefore, there could be a delay


-----

in the enforcement of the Collateral in Spain while the Security Agent obtains such powers and the
relevant public deeds as granted.

In the absence of the notarized and apostilled powers of attorney, the Security Agent may not be able
to enforce the relevant Spanish security interest on behalf of the holders of the Notes, and there is a
risk that the Security Agent would only be able to enforce the security interest against the debt that it
individually holds, and not for the full amount owed to creditors for whom it may be acting as Security
Agent. Further, those beneficial holders of the security who have not accepted the security or duly
empowered (by means of notarial and apostilled powers of attorney) the Trustee or Security Agent to
do so may be treated, from a Spanish law perspective including without limitation in an insolvency
scenario, as unsecured creditors.

Further, it is worth noting that there is a risk that the relevant court or notary public before whom any
Spanish security interest may eventually be enforced might request both the notarization of the
documents from which the relevant obligations arise, and the notarization of each and every one of
the transfer certificates regarding each and every transfer of the Notes.

**Portuguese Insolvency Laws**
Two of the Guarantors of the Notes are incorporated under the laws of Portugal. The Portuguese
insolvency law (approved by Decree-Law no. 53/2004, of March 18, and generally termed CIRE
(Código da Insolvência e da Recuperação de Empresas), as amended) governs court insolvency
proceedings, as opposed to out-of-court liquidation.

As a general rule insolvency proceedings governed by the CIRE are only available when the debtor
has sufficient assets to meet its liabilities and are applicable to all persons and entities, subject to
certain exceptions, such as public entities, state-owned companies and insurance companies, credit
institutions, financial companies, investment companies, which render services related with the
holding of funds or securities on behalf of third parties, and collective investment schemes to the
extent that the submission to the insolvency proceeding would be contradictory/incompatible with the
special legal frameworks of such entities. These proceedings may lead either to the restructuring of
the business (by the approval of an insolvency plan) or to the liquidation of the assets of the debtor. A
debtor may apply for insolvency proceedings when it finds itself unable to meet its obligations as they
become due or when it expects that it will shortly be unable to do so. In such cases, insolvency
proceedings are available as a type of legal protection that the debtor may request in order to avoid
the seizure of its assets by its creditors. Where a debtor becomes insolvent, failing to meet its current
outstanding obligations on a regular basis, the debtor (or, in the case of a company, its directors) is
under a legal obligation to file for insolvency proceedings.

Please note that in the case of legal entities, the debtor is also considered to be in an insolvency
situation when, according to accounting criteria, the liabilities of the debtor clearly excess its assets
(balance sheet test).

There are two types of claims for the purposes of the insolvency proceedings: the insolvency claims
(i.e. the debts before the creditors of the insolvent company, “dividas da insolvencia”) and the costs
and debts of the insolvency estate (“dividas da massa insolvente”), including amongst others, costs of
the proceedings and remuneration of the insolvency administrator which are paid prior to the
insolvency claims.

Upon the issue by a filing for insolvency proceedings by the court of an insolvency declaration, the
creditors of the insolvent debtor (including secured creditors) have to claim all debts owed to them by
the debtor and, provide documentation to justify such debts, within a period of up to 30 days. Based
on the documentation provided by the creditors and documentation held by the debtor, the insolvency
administrator draws up a list of acknowledged creditors and classifies them according to the
categories established under law:

(a)   Secured credits: credits secured by in rem guarantees (garantias reais) including special
statutory liens (privilégios creditórios especiais), e.g.:

    -    Real estate special statutory liens (e.g.: state credits related with real estate property tax
“IMI”)


-----

    -    Third parties credits (e.g. mortgage, income assignment, pledge)

    -    Movable assets special statutory liens (e.g. credits resulting from court expenses
incurred in the interest of the creditors)

(b)   Privileged credits: credits secured by general statutory liens (privilégios creditórios gerais) over
assets integrated in the insolvency estate up to the amount corresponding to the value of the
assets granted in guarantee or the general statutory liens, e.g.:

    -    Labor, tax and social security debts;

    -    Real estate general statutory liens.

(c)   Common credits: all credits not included in any other category.

(d)   Subordinated credits: (classified as such by virtue of the underlying credit agreement or
pursuant to law). Subordinated credits include, among others, credits held by parties in special
relationships with the debtor, such as, in the case of an individual, credits held by his/her
relatives; in the case of a legal entity, credits held by the members of the management body,
group companies and controlling shareholders or shareholders in a group relationship,
including intercompany loans. Certain subordinated creditors are not entitled to vote on the
restructuring arrangement and usually subordinated creditors have very limited chances of
collection, as a result of the ranking established by law.

The payment to creditors of the incolvent entity will be performed according to the credit ranking,
being firstly paid the secured credits, followed by privileged credits (in the event of liquidation, they
are the first to collect payment against the assets on which their debt is secured or over which they
have privileges in the order established by law), common credits and finally subordinated credits. If
the assets of the insolvency estate are insufficient to fully pay all creditors, the payment to common
creditors will be made by apportionment amongst all creditors and in proportion of their credits. The
payment of subordinated credits will only take place after full payment of common credits.

All creditors may be subject to the restructuring arrangement. However, whilst secured and privileged
creditors can dispute the restructuring arrangement by opposing the insolvency plan and claiming that
they will be in a worse position than if the restructuring plan was not approved, the remaining
creditors may only do so provided that certain requirements set forth by law are met.

Please note that payments described above are discounted for the payment of certain liquidation and
insolvency expenses (the “dividas da massa insolvente”).

Insolvency proceedings are not compatible with other enforcement proceedings filed, or to be filed
against the debtor.

The CIRE provides that, upon the insolvency of a debtor, acts entered into or omitted within the two
years prior to the beginning of the insolvency proceeding may be cancelled in favor of the insolvency
estate if they: (i) are detrimental to the insolvency estate (i.e., actions that reduce, frustrate, obstruct,
jeopardize or delay the payment to the insolvency estate’s creditors), and (ii) have been carried out in
bad faith;. The insolvency administrator has six months to cancel these actions from the moment it
becomes aware of them, but may, as a rule, never do so after a two year period has elapsed from the
declaration of insolvency. Bad faith for these purposes is the acknowledgment, as of the date of the
transaction in question, that (i) the debtor was insolvent, (ii) insolvency proceedings had commenced
against the debtor or (iii) the transaction in question would be detrimental to the creditors of the
debtor and such debtor was in an imminent insolvency situation. There is a refutable presumption of
“bad faith” if the transaction is entered into within the two years prior to the commencement of
insolvency proceedings and is made with certain related parties.

As an exception to the above rules, article 121 of the CIRE identifies certain actions that are
automatically (iuris et de iure) considered as hindering the insolvency estate and that may be
cancelled irrespective of bad faith. These actions include (i) acts entered into by the company within
the two years prior to the beginning of the insolvency proceedings which can be qualified as a
gratuity; (ii) payments or other forms of debt extinction made in the six month period prior to the
commencement of the insolvency procedure and carried out in unusual terms for standard market
practice and that the creditor could not demand; (iii) payments or other forms of debt extinction made


-----

before the relevant credits had become due and that occurred in the six month period prior to the
commencement of the insolvency procedure or after such commencement but before the credits had
become due; (iv) granting in rem security interests (garantias reais) to pre-existing credits or others
that replace them in the six month period prior to the commencement of the insolvency procedure;
(v) granting in rem security interests (garantias reais) simultaneously with the secured obligation in
the 60 day period prior to the commencement of the insolvency procedure; (vi) granting personal
guarantees in the six month period prior to the commencement of the insolvency procedure that do
not relate to business transactions with a real interest to the debtor; and (vii) reimbursement of
shareholder’s loans (“suprimentos”) occurred during the year before the beginning of the insolvency
proceedings.

Under Portuguese law there is no legal concept of “trustee” or “parallel debt” and its use in the
context of an insolvency proceeding subject to the CIRE may be disputed as (i) it may lead to argue
that the holders of the Notes should not be ranked as guaranteed creditors since they do not have
direct secured claims (as security was granted to the Security Agent), (ii) the holder of the Notes may
not have the ability to directly enforce the security interest, (iii) there is a risk that the Security Agent
would only be able to enforce the security interest against the debt that it individually holds, and not
for the full amount owed to creditors for whom it may be acting as Security Agent and (iv) a
Portuguese insolvency court may decide not to enforce the terms of intercreditor agreements, when
allocating the proceeds, as in such allocation they are bound to comply with the rules set forth by the
CIRE.

_Recovery procedure_
The recovery procedure (hereinafter “PER”) established in the CIRE aims to allow a company debtor
in financial difficulties or in an imminent insolvency situation but whose recovery is still possible, to
reach an agreement with its creditors in an attempt to restructure and preserve the business.

The main aim of the PER is to allow the recovery of a company when that is deemed to be possible.

When a company applies to the PER, this prevents any proceedings to recover debts being brought
against such company and, while the negotiations are on-going, it suspends any proceedings to
recover debt against the company that are still pending. If a recovery plan is approved the
proceedings against the company to recover debts are extinguished, unless otherwise provided in the
plan.

Additionally, when a company applies to the PER, it suspends any proceedings against it seeking its
insolvency declaration, save if a declaration of insolvency has already been issued by the competent
court The PER procedure starts with a written declaration signed by the company and by at least one
of its creditors (not being necessary for it to be the main creditor but must be holder of at least 10%
of the non-subordinated credits of the company) stating that the company intends to enter into
negotiations with the creditors pursuant to its revitalization by the approval of a recovery plan and
demonstrating that the company fulfils the requirements for the PER to be granted evidenced by an
independent auditor report.

If the recovery plan is approved by the creditors, the judge may either ratify or refuse to ratify the
plan.

The court’s decision binds all creditors, even those that have not participated or approved in the
negotiations. Moreover, the court’s decision to definitively put an end to any suspended debt recovery
actions, except when the plan expressly states otherwise.

If the company or a majority of its creditors conclude, in advance, that it is not possible to reach an
agreement or an agreement is not achieved by the deadline for concluding the negotiations, the
negotiating process is terminated. If the company is not yet in an insolvency situation, the PER is
brought to an end and its effects are extinguished. Should the company be already in an insolvency
situation, the PER proceeding will be converted into an insolvency proceeding (as detailed above).

_Extrajudicial agreement_
Further to the main PER procedure abovementioned, the Portuguese insolvency law also sets forth
another sub-type of recovery procedure which is initiated with the execution of a recovery plan by


-----

way of an agreement negotiated and concluded before the judicial procedure by and between the
company and some (or all) of its creditors, that is brought to the court for ratification, as defined by
law.

**Luxembourg Insolvency Laws**
The Notes will be issued by the Issuer, which is a private liability company (société à responsabilité
_limitée), incorporated under Luxembourg law, with its registered office at 46, Place Guillaume II,_
L-1648 Luxembourg, Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and is in the process of being registered with the
Luxembourg Register of Commerce and companies and will be guaranteed by the Parent (the
“Luxembourg Guarantor ”). Under Luxembourg insolvency laws, your ability to receive payments of
interest and principal on the Notes and under the Note Guarantees, may be more limited than would
be the case under U.S. or other bankruptcy laws. Luxembourg courts should have, in principle,
jurisdiction to open main insolvency proceedings with respect to the Issuer and the Luxembourg
Guarantor, as entities, having their respective registered office, central administration (administration
_centrale) and COMI, as used in the EU Insolvency Regulation 2017, in the Grand Duchy of_
Luxembourg, such proceedings to be governed by Luxembourg insolvency laws. According to article
3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation 2017, there is a rebuttable presumption that a company has its
COMI in the jurisdiction in which it has the place of its registered office. As a result, there is a
rebuttable presumption that the COMI of the Issuer and the Luxembourg Guarantor is in the Grand
Duchy of Luxembourg and consequently that any “main insolvency proceedings” (as defined in the
EU Insolvency Regulation 2017) would be opened by a Luxembourg court and be governed by
Luxembourg law. Under Luxembourg law, the following types of proceedings (together referred to as
insolvency proceedings) may be opened against a company incorporated (i) having its COMI in
Luxembourg, or (ii) in the case the COMI of such company is in a jurisdiction which is outside of the
territorial scope of the EU Insolvency Regulation 2017, if its place of central administration
(administration centrale) is in Luxembourg:

-    Bankruptcy proceedings (faillite), the opening of which may be requested by the Luxembourg
company, by any of its creditors or by the courts ex officio. Following such a request, the
Luxembourg courts having jurisdiction may open bankruptcy proceedings if the Luxembourg
company (i) is in a state of cessation of payments (cessation des paiements) and (ii) has lost
its commercial creditworthiness (ébranlement du crédit). The main effect of such proceedings is
the sale of the assets and allocation of the proceeds of such sale between creditors taking into
account their rank of privilege, as well as the suspension of all measures of enforcement
against the company, except, subject to certain limited exceptions, for enforcement by secured
creditors, such as secured creditors enjoying a financial collateral arrangement falling within
the scope of the Collateral Act 2005, and the payment of the secured creditors in accordance
with their rank upon realization of the assets. In addition, the managers or directors of a
Luxembourg company that ceases its payments (i.e. is unable to pay its debts as they fall due
with normal means of payment) must within one month of them having become aware of the
company’s cessation of payments, file a petition for bankruptcy (faillite) with the court clerk of
the district court of the company’s registered office. If the managers or directors fail to comply
with such provision they may be held (i) liable towards the company or any third parties on the
basis of principles of managers’ / directors’ liability for any loss suffered and (ii) criminally liable
for simple bankruptcy (banqueroute simple) in accordance with article 574 of the Luxembourg
commercial code.

-    Controlled management proceedings (gestion contrôlée), the opening of which may only be
requested by the company and not by its creditors and under which a Luxembourg court may
order the provisional stay of enforcement of claims except for certain secured creditors (see
the below applicable provisions of the Collateral Act 2005); or

-    Composition with creditors proceedings (concordat préventif de la faillite), which may be
requested only by the company (subject to obtaining prior consent of the majority of its
creditors representing at least three-quarters of its debts) and not by its creditors directly. The
Luxembourg court’s decision to admit a company to the composition proceedings triggers a
provisional stay on enforcement of claims by creditors except for certain secured creditors (see
the below applicable provisions of the Collateral Act 2005).


-----

-    In relation to secondary proceedings within the meaning of the EU Insolvency Regulation 2017,
if an entity has an establishment (as described in the EU Insolvency Regulation 2017) in the
Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the only insolvency proceedings that may be opened will be
bankruptcy proceedings (faillite) with limited effects to the assets located in Luxembourg.

-    In addition to the proceedings described above, your ability to receive payment on the Notes
and the Note Guarantees may be affected by a decision of a Luxembourg court to grant a stay
on payments (sursis de paiements) or to put a Luxembourg company into judicial liquidation
(liquidation judiciaire). Judicial liquidation proceedings may be opened at the request of the
public prosecutor against companies pursuing an activity violating criminal laws, or that are in
serious breach or in violation of the Luxembourg commercial code or of the Luxembourg law
dated 10 August 1915 on commercial companies, as amended (the “Luxembourg Companies
_Law”). The management of such liquidation proceedings will generally follow the rules_
applicable to Luxembourg bankruptcy proceedings.

The Issuer’s liabilities in respect of the Notes and the Luxembourg Guarantor’s liabilities in respect of
the Note Guarantees will, in the event of a liquidation of the Issuer following, in particular, bankruptcy
or judicial liquidation proceedings, only rank after the cost of liquidation (including any debt incurred
for the purpose of such liquidation) and any claims that are preferred under Luxembourg law.
Preferential claims under Luxembourg law include, among others:

-    amounts owed to the Luxembourg Revenue;

-    value added tax and other taxes and duties owed to the Luxembourg Customs and Excise;

-    employees’ and employer’s social security contributions;

-    landlord, pledgor not under the Collateral Act 2005; and

-    remuneration owed to employees (last six months’ wages amounting to a maximum of six
times the minimum social salary).

For the avoidance of doubt, the above list is not exhaustive.

Assets over which a security interest has been granted will, in principle, not be available for
distribution to unsecured creditors (except after enforcement and, only to the extent a surplus is
realized, and subject to preferential claims, liens and privileges arising under mandatorily law, if any).

Article 20 of the Collateral Act 2005 provides that Luxembourg law collateral arrangements (pledges,
transfers of title by way of security and repo agreements) over claims and financial instruments falling
within the scope of the Collateral Act 2005, as well as all enforcement measures and valuation and
enforcement measures agreed upon by the parties in accordance with that law, are valid and
enforceable, even if entered into during the hardening period, against third parties, commissioners,
receivers, liquidators and other similar persons notwithstanding the insolvency proceedings (save in
the case of fraud).

Article 24 of the Collateral Act 2005 provides that foreign law security interests over claims or
financial instruments granted by a Luxembourg pledgor will be valid and enforceable as a matter of
Luxembourg law notwithstanding any Luxembourg insolvency proceedings, if such foreign law
security interests are similar in nature to a Luxembourg security interest falling within the scope of the
Collateral Act 2005. If Article 24 applies, Luxembourg preference period rules do not apply (save the
case of fraud).

Article 21(2) of the Collateral Act 2005 provides that where a financial collateral arrangement has
been entered into after the opening of liquidation proceedings or the coming into force of
reorganization measures or the entry into force of such measures, such arrangement is enforceable
against third parties, administrators, insolvency receivers, liquidators and other similar persons if the
collateral taker proves that it was unaware of the fact that such proceedings had been opened or that
such measures had been taken or that it could not reasonably be aware of such proceedings,
measures or arrangement.


-----

**_Impact of insolvency proceedings on transactions_**
During such insolvency proceedings, all enforcement measures by unsecured creditors are
suspended. Other than as described above in respect of the provisions of the Collateral Act 2005, the
ability of secured creditors to enforce their security interests may also be limited, in particular in the
event of controlled management proceedings expressly providing that the rights of certain secured
creditors are frozen until a final decision has been taken by a Luxembourg court as to the petition for
controlled management and may be affected thereafter by any reorganization order given by the
court. A reorganization order requires the prior approval by more than 50% of the creditors
representing more than 50% of a Luxembourg company’s liabilities in order to take effect.

Furthermore, you should note that declarations of default and any subsequent acceleration (such as
acceleration upon the occurrence of an event of default) will not be enforceable during controlled
management proceedings. However, during such controlled management proceedings a notice of
default may still be served.

Luxembourg insolvency laws may also affect transactions entered into or payments made by the
Issuer during the preference period (période suspecte) which is a maximum of six months as from the
date on which the Commercial Court formally adjudicates a company bankrupt, and, as for specific
payments and transactions, during an additional period of ten days before the commencement of
such period preceding the judgment declaring bankruptcy, except that in certain specific situations the
court may set the start of the suspect period at an earlier date, if the bankruptcy judgment was
preceded by another insolvency proceedings (e.g., a suspension of payments or controlled
management proceedings) under Luxembourg law. In particular:

-    pursuant to article 445 of the Luxembourg code of commerce (Code de Commerce), specified
transactions (such as, in particular, the granting of a security interest for antecedent debts save
in respect of financial collateral arrangements within the meaning of the Collateral Act 2005;
payment of debts which have not fallen due, whether payment is made in cash or by way of
assignment, sale, set-off or by any other means; the payment of debts which have fallen due
by any means other than in cash or by bill of exchange; the sale of assets without
consideration or with substantially inadequate consideration) entered into during the preference
period (or the ten days preceding it) must be set aside or declared null and void, if so
requested by the insolvency receiver; article 445 does not apply for financial collateral
arrangements such as Luxembourg law pledges over shares, accounts or receivables and setoff arrangements falling within the scope of the Collateral Act 2005;

-    pursuant to article 446 of the Luxembourg code of commerce, payments made for matured
debts as well as other transactions (save financial collateral arrangements within the meaning
of the Collateral Act 2005) concluded for consideration during the preference period are subject
to cancellation by the court upon proceedings instituted by the insolvency receiver if they were
concluded with the knowledge of the bankrupt party’s cessation of payments; article 446 does
not apply for financial collateral arrangements, such as Luxembourg law pledges over shares,
accounts or receivables and set-off arrangements falling within the scope of the Collateral Act
2005; and

-    pursuant to article 448 of the Luxembourg code of commerce and article 1167 of the
Luxembourg civil code (action paulienne), the insolvency receiver (acting on behalf of the
creditors) has the right to challenge any fraudulent payments and transactions, including the
granting of security with an intent to defraud, made prior to the bankruptcy, without any time
limit.

In principle, a bankruptcy order rendered by a Luxembourg court does not result in the automatic
termination of contracts except for intuitu personae agreements, that is, contracts for which the
identity of the company or its solvency were crucial (such as employment agreements and powers of
attorney). The contracts, therefore, subsist after the bankruptcy order. However, the bankruptcy
receiver may choose to terminate certain contracts so as to avoid worsening the financial situation of
the company. As of the date of adjudication of bankruptcy, no interest on any unsecured claim will
accrue vis-à-vis the bankruptcy estate. Insolvency proceedings may hence have a material adverse
effect on Luxembourg company’s business and assets and Luxembourg company’s respective
obligations under the Notes.


-----

Finally, international aspects of Luxembourg bankruptcy, controlled management or composition
proceedings may be subject to the EU Insolvency Regulation 2017. In particular, rights in rem over
assets located in another jurisdiction where the EU Insolvency Regulation 2017 will not be affected by
the opening of insolvency proceedings, without prejudice however to the applicability of rules relating
to the voidness, voidability or unenforceability of legal acts detrimental to all the creditors (subject to
the application of article 24 of the Collateral Act 2005 as described above and article 13 of the EU
Insolvency Regulation 2017).

**Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests in**
**Luxembourg**
According to Luxembourg conflict of law rules, Luxembourg courts will generally apply, in relation to
the creation, perfection and enforcement of security interests over the assets subject to such security
interests, the law of the place where such assets subject are situated. As a consequence,
Luxembourg law will apply in relation to the creation, perfection and enforcement of security interests
over assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg, such as registered shares in
Luxembourg companies, cash bank accounts held with a Luxembourg bank, receivables/claims
having debtors located in Luxembourg and/or governed by Luxembourg law, securities which are held
through an account located (or deemed to be located) in Luxembourg and bearer securities physically
held in Luxembourg.

If certain assets are located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg, the security interests over such
assets will be governed by Luxembourg law and must be created, perfected and enforced in
accordance with Luxembourg law. The creation, validity and enforcement of security interests such as
pledges and transfer of ownership as security, granted on financial instruments and claims (in order
to secure cash settlement and/or delivery of financial instruments) are notably governed by the
Collateral Act 2005. Pursuant to the Collateral Act 2005, a pledge (gage) is effected by a transfer of
possession of the pledged assets to the pledgee or to a third party acting as depository for the
pledgee and the pledgee’s preference rights over the pledged assets only remain in existence as long
as the pledgee or the depository remains in possession of such assets.

Under the Collateral Act 2005, the perfection of pledges depends on certain registration, notification
and acceptance requirements. A share pledge over registered shares in a Luxembourg company
must be acknowledged and accepted by the company which has issued the shares (that are pledged)
and, as a documentary point, be registered in the shareholders’ register of that company. If future
shares are pledged, the perfection of such pledge will require additional registration in the
shareholders’ register of the company concerned. A pledge over receivables will be validly created
and perfected provided that the receivables pledge agreement is executed by all the parties thereto.
However, if the debtor has not been notified of the receivables pledge or if it did not otherwise acquire
knowledge of the pledge, it will be validly discharged of its obligations if it pays the pledgor. A bank
account pledge agreement must be notified to and accepted by the account bank so as to ensure that
the account bank has waived any pre-existing security interests and other rights in respect of the
pledged account. If (future) bank accounts are pledged, such additional notification to, acceptance
and waiver by the account bank will be required.

The above perfection steps and actions need to be undertaken by the grantor of the security interest
and/or the Security Agent. If the relevant pledgor or the Security Agent fail or are unable to take the
necessary steps/actions required to take or perfect any of the above-mentioned security interests,
such security interests will not have been created and/or perfected with respect to the claims arising
under the Notes. Absent perfection, the Security Agent may have difficulty enforcing its rights in the
Collateral with regard to third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim
a security interest in the same collateral. Finally, since the ranking of pledges is determined by the
date on which they became enforceable against third parties, a security interest created on a later
date over the same Collateral, but which comes into force as against third parties earlier (by way of
accomplishment of the relevant perfection requirements) has priority.

Article 11 of the Collateral Act 2005 sets out the following enforcement methods, available upon the
occurrence of the relevant enforcement event in respect of a pledge governed by the provisions of
the Collateral Act 2005 (subject to certain specifications depending on the nature of the pledged
assets):


-----

-    appropriation by the pledgee or appropriation by a third party of the pledged assets at (i) a
value determined (before or after appropriation) in accordance with a valuation method agreed
upon by the parties or (ii) the listing price of the pledged assets (if the pledged assets are listed
on an official Luxembourg or foreign stock market or traded on a recognized regulated market
open to the public);

-    selling or causing the sale of the pledged assets (i) in a private transaction at commercially
reasonable terms (conditions commerciales normales), (ii) by a public sale at the stock
exchange, or (iii) by way of a public auction;

-    court allocation of the pledged assets to the pledgee in discharge of the secured obligations
following a valuation made by a court-appointed expert; or

-    set-off between the secured obligations and the pledged assets.

As the Collateral Act 2005 does not provide any specific time periods and depending on (i) the
method chosen, (ii) the valuation of the pledged assets, (iii) any possible recourses, and (iv) the
possible need to involve third parties, such as, e.g., courts, stock exchanges and appraisers, the
enforcement of the security interests might be delayed. No legal proceedings are required for most
enforcements methods.

Foreign law governed security interests and the powers of any receivers/administrators may not be
enforceable in respect of assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg. Security
interests/arrangements, which are not expressly recognized under Luxembourg law and the powers
of any receivers/administrators may not be recognized or enforced by the Luxembourg courts, in
particular where the Luxembourg security grantor becomes subject to Luxembourg insolvency
proceedings or where the Luxembourg courts otherwise have jurisdiction because of the actual or
deemed location of the relevant rights or assets, except if “main insolvency proceedings” (as defined
in the EU Insolvency Regulation 2017) are opened under Luxembourg law and such security
interests/arrangements constitute rights in rem over assets located in another Member State in which
the EU Insolvency Regulation 2017 applies, and in accordance of article 5 of the EU Insolvency
Regulation 2017.

The perfection of the security interests created pursuant to the pledge agreements does not prevent
any third party creditor from seeking attachment or execution against the assets, which are subject to
the security interests created under the pledge agreements, to satisfy their unpaid claims against the
pledgor. Such creditor may seek the forced sale of the assets of the pledgors through court
proceedings, although the beneficiaries of the pledges will in principle remain entitled in priority to the
proceeds of such sale (subject to preferred rights by operation of law).

When a Luxembourg company grants guarantees and/or security interests, applicable corporate
procedures normally entail that the decision be approved by a board resolution or by the decision of
delegates that have been appointed for such purpose. In addition, the granting of the envisaged
guarantees and/or security interests must comply with the Luxembourg company’s corporate object.

The proposed action by the company must be “in the corporate interest of the company”, which is a
translation of the French “intérêt social ”, an equivalent term to the English legal concept of corporate
benefit. The concept of “corporate interest” is not defined by law, but has been developed by doctrine
and court precedents and may be described as being “the limit of acceptable corporate behavior”.
Whereas the previous discussions regarding the limits of corporate power are based on objective
criteria (provisions of law and of the articles of association), the concept of corporate benefit requires
a subjective judgment. In a group context, the interest of the companies of the group taken
individually is not entirely eliminated.

With respect to guarantors incorporated in Luxembourg, even if the Luxembourg Companies Law,
does not provide for rules governing the ability of a Luxembourg company to guarantee the
indebtedness of another entity of the same group, it is generally held that within a group of
companies, in the context of a group of related companies, the existence of a group interest in
granting upstream or cross-stream assistance under any form (including under the form of guarantee)
to other group companies could constitute sufficient corporate benefit to enable a Luxembourg
company to grant such guarantee, provided that the following conditions are met (and subject in any
event to all the factual circumstances of the matter): (i) such guarantee must be given for the purpose


-----

of promoting a common economic, social and financial interest determined in accordance with
policies applicable to the entire group, (ii) the commitment to grant such guarantee must not be
without consideration and such commitment must not be manifestly disproportionate in view of the
obligations entered into by other group companies, and (iii) such guarantee granted or any other
financial commitments must not exceed the financial capabilities of the committing company.

It is generally considered that (i) downstream personal guarantees are in the direct interest of a
company and that hence no corporate benefit issues should arise. Indeed, the company, through its
participation in the subsidiary which it guarantees, would indirectly receive the benefits of the facilities
made available to its subsidiary and, as a result thereof, the value of its participation in such
subsidiary could increase, entitling it for instance to receive dividends or similar payments from its
subsidiary and (ii) upstream and cross-stream personal guarantees are less likely to be in the interest
of a company. As a result thereof and unless the corporate interest of a company granting an
upstream or a cross-stream guarantee derives clearly from the specific circumstances of the
transaction, upstream and cross-stream guarantees are generally limited in order to address the
requirement relating to the guarantees do not exceed the financial capabilities of the company which
bears the burden of such commitments.

Although the existence of a corporate interest in the granting of a guarantee or a security interest on
a group level is certainly important, the mere existence of such a group interest does not compensate
for a lack of corporate interest for one or more of the companies of the group taken individually. The
concept of corporate benefit is of particular importance in the context of misuse of corporate assets
provided by Article 171-1 of the Luxembourg Companies Law.

The failure to comply with the corporate benefit requirement will typically result in liability (personal
and/or criminal) for the directors or managers of the guarantor concerned. The guarantees or security
interests granted by a Luxembourg company could themselves be held void or unenforceable if their
granting is contrary to Luxembourg public policy (ordre public). It should be stressed that, as is the
case with all criminal offenses addressed by the Luxembourg Company Law, a director or a manager
of a company will in general be prosecuted for misuse of corporate assets only if someone has
lodged a complaint with the public prosecutor. This person may be an interested third party, e.g., a
creditor, a minority shareholder, a liquidator or an insolvency receiver. In addition, it cannot be
excluded that the public prosecutor could act on its own initiative if the existence of such a misuse of
corporate assets became known to him. If there is a misuse of corporate assets criminally sanctioned
by court, then this could, under general principles of law, have the effect that contracts concluded in
breach of Article 171-1 of the Luxembourg Companies Law will be held null and void. The criteria
mentioned above have to be applied on a case-by-case basis, and a subjective, fact-based judgment
is required to be made, by the directors or managers of the Luxembourg company. As a result of the
above developments, the guarantees or security interests granted by a Luxembourg company will be
subject to certain limitations, which will take the form of general limitation language (limiting the
guarantee obligations of such Luxembourg company to a certain percentage of, inter alia, its net
assets (capitaux propres) and certain intra-group liabilities), which is inserted in the relevant finance
document(s), indenture or guarantee agreements and which covers the aggregate obligations and
exposure of the relevant Luxembourg company under all finance documents, indenture or guarantee
agreements.

The registration of the Notes, the security interest agreements, the Indenture, the Note Guarantees
and the transaction documents is required if such security interest agreements, the Indenture, the
Note Guarantees and the transaction documents are either (i) attached as an annex to an act
(annexés à un acte) that itself is subject to mandatory registration or (ii) deposited in the minutes of a
notary (déposés au rang des minutes d’un notaire). In such cases, as well as in case of a voluntary
registration, the security interest agreements, the Indenture, the Note Guarantees and the transaction
documents will be subject to registration duties payable by the party registering, or being ordered to
register, the security interest agreements, the Indenture, the Note Guarantees and the transaction
documents. Depending on the nature of the security interest agreements, the Indenture, the Note
Guarantees and the transaction documents, such registration duties would be ad valorem (such as
for instance a registration duty of 0.24% calculated on the amounts mentioned in those agreements)
or fixed (such as for instance a registration duty of €12 for a pledge).


-----

The Luxembourg courts or the official Luxembourg authority may require (when these are presented
before them) that the notes, the security interest agreements, the indenture, the guarantees and the
transaction documents (and any document in connection therewith) and any judgment obtained in a
foreign court be partially or fully translated into French or German.

# Tax Considerations

**EU Savings Directive. Automatic Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes**
Pursuant to the EC Council Directive 2003/48/EC on the taxation of savings income in the form of
interest payments (the “Savings Tax Directive”), Member States were required to provide to the tax
authorities of another Member State details of payments of interest (or similar income which may
include distributions by a company) paid by a person within its jurisdiction to an individual resident in
that other Member State.

On November 10, 2015, the Council of the European Union adopted a Council Directive repealing the
Savings Tax Directive from January 1, 2017 in the case of Austria and from January 1, 2016 in the
case of all other Member States (subject to on-going requirements to fulfill administrative obligations
such as the reporting and exchange of information relating to, and accounting for withholding taxes
on, payments made before those dates).

This is to prevent overlap between the Savings Tax Directive and a new automatic exchange of
information regime to be implemented under Council Directive 2011/16/EU on Administrative
Cooperation in the field of Taxation (as amended by Council Directive 2014/107/EU) (hereinafter,
DAC2). DAC2 provides for the implementation among EU member states (and certain other countries
that have entered into information exchange agreements) of the automatic exchange of information in
respect of various categories of income and capital and broadly encompasses the regime known as
the CRS proposed by the OECD as a new global standard for the automatic exchange of information
between tax authorities in participating jurisdictions. DAC2 is generally broader in scope than the
Savings Tax Directive, although it does not impose withholding taxes.

Under the CRS, governments of participating jurisdictions (currently more than 90 jurisdictions) are
required to collect detailed information to be shared with other jurisdictions annually. A group of over
40 countries, including Ireland, have committed to the early adoption of the CRS from January 1,
2016 with the first data exchanges taking place in September 2017. All EU member states, except
Austria, will introduce the CRS from January 1, 2016. Austria will introduce the CRS from January 1,
2017.

The CRS is implemented in Ireland pursuant to the Returns of Certain Information by Reporting
Financial Institutions Regulations 2015, S.I. 583 of 2015, made under Section 891F of the Taxes Act.

DAC2 is implemented in Ireland pursuant to the Mandatory Automatic Exchange of Information in the
Field of Taxation Regulations of 2015, S.I. No. 609 of 2015 made under Section 891G of the Taxes
Act.

Pursuant to these Regulations, the Issuer will be required to obtain and report to revenue
commissioners annually certain financial account and other information for all new and existing
accountholders in respect of their Notes. The first returns must be submitted on or before June 30,
2017 with respect to the year ended December 31, 2016. The information will include amongst other
things, details of the name, address, taxpayer identification number (“TIN”), place of residence and, in
the case of accountholders who are individuals, the date and place of birth, together with details
relating to payments made to accountholders and their holdings. This information may be shared with
tax authorities in other EU member states (and in certain other countries subject to the terms of
information exchange agreements entered into with those countries) and jurisdictions which
implement the OECD Common Reporting Standard.

**Luxembourg Tax Considerations**

**_A)   Tax residency_**
A holder of Notes will not become resident, or be deemed to be resident, in Luxembourg by reason
only of the holding of the Notes, or the execution, performance, delivery and/or enforcement of the
Notes.


-----

**_B)   Luxembourg withholding tax on the Notes_**
Under Luxembourg tax law currently in effect a subject to the Luxembourg law of December 23,
2005, as amended (the “Law ”), all payments of interest (including accrued but unpaid interest) and
principal made by the Issuer in the context of the holding, disposal, redemption or repurchase of the
Notes, which are not profit sharing, can be made free and clear of any withholding or deduction for or
on account of any taxes of whatsoever nature imposed, levied, withheld, or assessed by Luxembourg
or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein, in accordance with the applicable
Luxembourg law.

Under the Law, as amended, a 20% withholding tax (the “20% Tax”) has been introduced on interest
payments made by Luxembourg paying agents (within the meaning of the Law) to Luxembourg
resident individuals.

Pursuant to the Law, Luxembourg resident individuals, acting in the course of their private wealth, can
opt to self-declare and pay a 20% levy (the “20% Levy ”) on interest payments made by paying agents
located outside Luxembourg in a Member State of either the European Union or the European
Economic Area.

The 20% Tax as described above or the 20% Levy are final when Luxembourg resident individuals
are acting the context of the management of their private wealth.

Responsibility for the withholding of tax in application of the Law, is assumed by the Luxembourg
paying agent within the meaning of the Law and not by the Issuer (unless the Issuer acts as a paying
agent).

**_C)   Luxembourg taxation of the holders of Notes_**

_Taxation of Luxembourg non-residents_
Holders of Notes who are non-residents of Luxembourg and who have neither a permanent
establishment, nor a permanent representative nor a fixed base of business in Luxembourg with
which/whom the holding of the Notes is connected are not liable to pay any Luxembourg income tax,
whether they receive payments of principal, payments of interest (including accrued but unpaid
interest), payments received upon the redemption, repurchase or exchange of the Notes, or realize
capital gains on the sale of any Notes.

_Taxation of Luxembourg residents_

General
Luxembourg resident holders of Notes will not be liable to any Luxembourg income tax on repayment
of principal.

Luxembourg resident individuals
Luxembourg resident individual holders of Notes, acting in the course of the management of their
private wealth, are subject to Luxembourg income tax at progressive rates in respect of interest
received, redemption premiums or issue discounts under the Notes, except if the 20% Tax has been
levied by a Luxembourg paying agent on such payments or, in case of a non-resident paying agent, if
they have opted to self-declare and pay the 20% Levy. The 20% Tax or the 20% Levy represent the
final tax liability on interest received for Luxembourg resident individual holders of Notes receiving the
payment in the course of the management of their private wealth and can be reduced in
consideration of foreign withholding tax, based on double tax treaties concluded by Luxembourg.

Luxembourg resident individual holders of Notes receiving interest as business income must include
interest income in their taxable basis. If applicable, the 20% Tax levied will be credited against their
final income tax liability.

Luxembourg resident individual holders of Notes are not subject to taxation on capital gains upon the
disposal of the Notes owned in the framework of the management of their private wealth, unless (i)
the disposal of the Notes precedes the acquisition of the Notes, or (ii) the Notes are disposed of
within six months of their date of acquisition. Upon redemption/sale of the Notes, the portion of the
redemption/sales price corresponding to accrued but unpaid interest will be subject to the 20% Tax or
to the 20% Levy. The 20% Tax or the 20% Levy represent the final tax liability for Luxembourg


-----

resident individual holders of Notes receiving the payment in the course of the management of their
private wealth. Luxembourg resident individual holders of Notes receiving the interest as business
income must include the portion of the redemption/sales price corresponding to this interest in their
taxable income. The 20% Tax levied will be credited against their final income tax liability.

Luxembourg resident companies
Luxembourg resident company (sociétés de capitaux) holders of Notes or foreign entities of the same
type which have a permanent establishment or a permanent representative in Luxembourg with which
the holding of the Notes is connected, must include in their taxable income any interest income
(including accrued but unpaid interest) and the difference between the sales price (including accrued
but unpaid interest) and the lower of the cost or book value of the Notes sold or converted.

Luxembourg resident companies benefiting from a special tax regime
Luxembourg resident company holders of Notes which are companies benefiting from a special tax
regime, such as, for example (i) family estate management companies subject to the Law of May 11,
2007, as amended, (ii) specialized investment funds subject to the Law of February 13, 2007, as
amended, (iii) undertakings for collective investment subject to the Law of December 17, 2010, as
amended or (iv) reserved alternative investment funds subject to the law of July 23, 2016 (which
benefit from the tax regime applicable to specialized investment funds) are neither subject to
Luxembourg income tax in respect of interest accrued or received, any redemption premium or issue
discount, nor on gains realized on the sale or disposal, in any form whatsoever, of the Notes.

**_D)   Luxembourg net wealth tax_**
An individual holder of Notes, whether he/she is resident of Luxembourg or not, should not be subject
to Luxembourg wealth tax on such Notes.

Luxembourg net wealth tax will not be levied on a corporate holder of Notes, unless:

(i)    such holder of Notes is, or is deemed to be a fully taxable Luxembourg resident company for
the purpose of the relevant provisions and is not a holder of Notes governed by (a) the law of
December 17, 2010, as amended, on undertakings for collective investment or (b) the law of
March 22, 2004, as amended, on securitization, or (c) the law of June 15, 2004, as amended,
on the investment company in risk capital, or (d) the law of May 11, 2007, as amended, on
family estate management companies or (e) the law of July 13, 2005, as amended, on
Luxembourg pension pooling vehicles or (f) the law of February 13, 2007, as amended, on
specialized investment funds or (g) the law of July 23, 2016 on reserved alternative investment
funds; or

(ii)   the Notes are attributable to an enterprise or part thereof which is carried on by a non-resident
company in Luxembourg through a permanent establishment, a permanent representative or a
fixed place of business.

Please note that securitization companies governed by the law of March 22, 2004, as amended, on
securitization, capital companies governed by the law of June 15, 2004, as amended, on venture
capital vehicles or reserved alternative investment funds governed by the law of July 23, 2016 (which
fall under the special tax regime set out under article 48 thereof) may, under certain conditions, be
subject to minimum net wealth tax.

**_E)    Other Luxembourg taxes_**
There is no Luxembourg registration tax, stamp duty or any other similar tax or duty payable in
Luxembourg by holders of Notes as a consequence of the issuance of the Notes, nor will any of
these taxes be payable as a consequence of a subsequent transfer, repurchase or redemption of the
Notes.

However, registration duty may be due upon the registration of the Notes in Luxembourg (i) in the
case of voluntary registration of the documents relating to the Notes, (ii) in the case where the
documents relating to the Notes are appended to a document that requires mandatory registration or
(iii) in the case such documents are deposited in the minutes of a notary (déposés au rang des
_minutes d’un notaire)._


-----

There is no Luxembourg value added tax payable in respect of payments in consideration for the
issuance of the Notes or in respect of the payment of interest or principal under the Notes or the
transfer of the Notes.

Luxembourg value added tax may, however, be payable in respect of fees charged for certain
services rendered to the Issuer, if for Luxembourg value added tax purposes such services are
rendered or are deemed to be rendered in Luxembourg under the reverse-charge principle and an
exemption from Luxembourg value added tax does not apply with respect to such services.

No gift, estate or inheritance taxes are levied on the transfer of the Notes upon death of a holders of
Notes in cases where the deceased was not a resident of Luxembourg for inheritance tax purposes,
or in the case of a gift, the gift is neither recorded in a Luxembourg notarial deed nor registered in
Luxembourg. However, where a holder of Notes is a resident of Luxembourg for tax purposes at the
time of his/her death, the Notes are included in his/her taxable estate for inheritance tax assessment
purposes.

**Spanish Tax Considerations**
This information has been prepared in accordance with the following Spanish tax legislation in force
at the date of this offering memorandum. Particularities approved by autonomous regions should also
be taken into account.

This section does not purport to deal with all aspects of Spanish taxation that relate to investment in
the Notes or that may be relevant to particular investors in light of their personal investment
circumstances. If you are considering buying Notes, you should consult your own tax advisor
concerning the tax consequences of holding the Notes in your particular situation.

text of such tax promulgated by Royal Legislative Decree 1/1993, of 24 September, and exempt from
value added tax, in accordance with Law 37/1992, of 28 December regulating such tax.

**_Individuals and Legal Entities with tax residency in Spain_**

_Personal Income Tax (Impuesto sobre la Renta de las Personas Físicas)_

_Interest on the Notes and disposal of the Notes_
Both interest periodically received and income derived from the transfer, redemption or repayment of
the Notes constitute a return on investment obtained from the transfer of a person’s own capital to
third parties in accordance with the provisions of Section 25 of the Personal Income Tax (“Impuesto
_sobre la Renta de las Personas Físicas”) Law, and therefore will form part of the so- called savings_
income tax base pursuant to the provisions of the Personal Income Tax Law and will be taxed at 19%
rate on the first €6,000, at 21% on the portion of the savings income between €6,001 and €50,000,
and at 23% rate on any amount exceeding €50,000 threshold.

_Spanish withholding tax on the Notes_
A withholding at a 19% rate is applicable on interest payments made to individual Spanish holders in
the event the Notes are deposited before or managed by Spanish-resident entities or persons or by
non-resident entities or persons operating in the Spanish territory through a permanent establishment
or if the above-mentioned persons or entities have been entrusted with the collection of the income
derived from the Notes, provided that such income has not been previously subject to withholding tax
in Spain. In addition, income obtained upon transfer or redemption of the Notes may also be subject
to PIT withholdings. In any event, individual Spanish holders may credit the withholding against their
final PIT liability for the relevant fiscal year.

_Wealth Tax (Impuesto sobre el Patrimonio)_
According to Wealth Tax regulations (subject to any exceptions provided under relevant legislation in
an autonomous region (Comunidad Autónoma)), the net worth of any individuals with tax residency in
Spain up to the amount of €700,000 is not subject to Wealth Tax. Therefore, they should take into
account the value of the Notes which they hold as at December 31 in each year, the applicable rates
ranging between 0.2% and 2.5%.

In accordance with article 4 of Royal Decree-Law 3/2016, of December 2, a full exemption on Net
Wealth Tax would apply in 2018 unless such exemption is revoked.

_Inheritance and Gift Tax (Impuesto sobre Sucesiones y Donaciones)_
Individuals with tax residency in Spain who acquire ownership or other rights over any Notes by
inheritance, gift or legacy will be subject to inheritance and gift tax in accordance with the applicable
Spanish regional or federal rules.

**_Legal entities with tax residency in Spain_**

_Corporate Income Tax (Impuesto sobre Sociedades)_

_Interest on the Notes_
Payments of income deriving from the transfer, redemption or repayment of the Notes constitute a
return on investments for tax purposes obtained from the transfer to third parties of own capital and
must be included in profit and taxable income of legal entities with tax residency in Spain for
corporate income tax (“CIT ”) purposes in accordance with the rules for CIT.

_Disposal of the Notes_
As a general rule, a disposal, whether in the form of a transfer, redemption or reimbursement, of the
Notes by a Spanish holder may give rise to a taxable income or an allowable loss for the purposes of
CIT.

The profit or loss arising from the disposal of the Notes for a Spanish holder (the quantification of
which, as a general rule, follows accounting rules) shall be subject to either the CIT or to the NonResident Income Tax as outlined below, as the case may be, at the relevant applicable tax rates.


-----

_Wealth Tax (Impuesto sobre el Patrimonio)_
Spanish resident legal entities are not subject to Wealth Tax.

_Inheritance and Gift Tax (Impuesto sobre Sucesiones y Donaciones)_
Legal entities with tax residency in Spain which acquire ownership or other rights over the Notes by
inheritance, gift or legacy are not subject to inheritance and gift tax and must include the market
value of the Notes in their taxable income for Spanish Corporate Income Tax purposes.

**_Individual and legal entities with no tax residency in Spain_**

_Non-Resident Income Tax (Impuesto sobre la Renta de No Residentes)_

(a)   Non-Spanish resident investors acting through a permanent establishment in Spain
Ownership of the Notes by investors who are not resident for tax purposes in Spain will not in
itself create the existence of a permanent establishment in Spain.

If the Notes form part of the assets of a permanent establishment in Spain of a person or legal
entity who is not resident in Spain for tax purposes, the tax rules applicable to income deriving
from such Notes are the same as those for Spanish CIT taxpayers.

(b)   Non-Spanish resident investors not acting through a permanent establishment in Spain
Payments of income deriving from the transfer, redemption or repayment of the Notes,
obtained by individuals or entities who have no tax residency in Spain, and which are NonResident Income Tax taxpayers with no permanent establishment in Spain will not be subject to
taxation in Spain.

_Wealth Tax (Impuesto sobre el Patrimonio)_
Individuals resident in a country with which Spain has entered into a double tax treaty in relation to
the Wealth Tax would generally not be subject to such tax. Otherwise, non-Spanish resident
individuals whose properties and rights located in Spain, or that can be exercised within the Spanish
territory exceed €700,000 would be subject to Wealth Tax, the applicable rates ranging between 0.2%
and 2.5%.

In accordance with article 4 of Royal Decree-Law 3/2016, of December 2, a full exemption on Net
Wealth Tax would apply in 2018 unless such exemption is revoked.

Non-Spanish resident legal entities are not subject to Wealth Tax.

_Inheritance and Gift Tax (Impuesto sobre Sucesiones y Donaciones)_
Individuals who do not have tax residency in Spain who acquire ownership or other rights over the
Notes by inheritance, gift or legacy, and who reside in a country with which Spain has entered into a
double tax treaty in relation to inheritance and gift tax will be subject to the relevant double tax treaty.

If the provisions of the foregoing paragraph do not apply, such individuals will be subject to
inheritance and gift tax in accordance with Spanish legislation.

Non-Spanish resident legal entities which acquire ownership or other rights over the Notes by
inheritance, gift or legacy are not subject to inheritance and gift tax. They will be subject to NonResident Income Tax. If the legal entity is resident in a country with which Spain has entered into a
double tax treaty, the provisions of such treaty will apply. In general, double-tax treaties provide for
the taxation of this type of income in the country of residence of the beneficiary.

**_Tax treatment of income payments made under the Note Guarantees by the Parent Guarantor or_**
**_other Spanish Guarantors_**
Any payments of principal and interest made by the Guarantors under the Guarantee should be
characterized as an indemnity and, therefore, be made free and clear of, and without withholding or
deduction for, any taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatsoever nature
imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by the Kingdom of Spain or any political subdivision
or authority thereof or therein having power to tax.


-----

However, although no clear precedent, statement of law or regulation exits in relation thereto, in the
event that the Spanish tax authorities take the view that the Guarantor has validly, legally and
effectively assumed all the obligations of the Issuer of the Notes subject to and in accordance with
the Guarantee, they may attempt to impose withholding tax in the Kingdom of Spain on any
payments made by any Guarantor resident in Spain for tax purposes, in respect of interest, unless
the recipient is the beneficial owner of the payment and is:

-    resident for tax purposes in a Member State of the European Union, other than Spain, or is a
permanent establishment of such resident situated in another Member State of the European
Union not resident in or acting through a territory considered as a tax haven pursuant to
Spanish law (currently set out in Royal Decree 1080/1991 of July 5) nor through a permanent
establishment in Spain or in a country outside the European Union, or

-    resident of a state with which Spain has entered into a Double Taxation Treaty which makes
provision for full exemption from tax imposed in Spain on such payment under the Double
Taxation Treaty,

provided that in either case of (i) and (ii) above, such recipient submits to the Guarantor the relevant
tax residence certificate, issued by the corresponding tax authorities in its own jurisdiction stating its
residence for tax purposes either within the relevant European Union Member State or in the relevant
country for the purposes of the Double Taxation Treaty, such certificate being valid for the period of
one year beginning from its date of issue under Spanish law. If such certificate is not provided or
payment is made to a holder of Notes who is not resident in the countries set out in (i) or (ii), the
Guarantor, or the Paying Agent acting on its behalf, would be required to withhold tax from the
relevant interest payments at the general withholding tax rate (as at the date of this offering
memorandum, 19%).

In connection with Spanish tax resident holders and non-Spanish tax resident holders acting with
respect to the Notes through a permanent establishment in Spain, income deriving from the
Guarantee will be subject to withholding tax according to the applicable general rules.

On the basis that the provisions of Law 10/2014 are applicable to the Notes, the Guarantor, in
accordance with such Law and with Royal Decree 1065/2007, would not be obliged to withhold taxes
in Spain on any interest paid under the Guarantee to the beneficial owners of the income arising from
the Notes (whether tax resident in Spain or not), provided that the Paying Agent complies with the
information procedures described in “—Information about the Notes in connection with payments”.

Otherwise, the Guarantor, or the Paying Agent acting on the Guarantor’s behalf, would be required to
withhold tax from the relevant interest payments at the general withholding tax rate (as at the date of
this offering memorandum, 19%).

**_Information about the Notes in connection with payments_**
As at the date of this offering memorandum, the Guarantor is required by Spanish law to file an
annual return with the Spanish tax authorities in which it reports on certain information relating to the
Notes. In accordance with Section 44 of Royal Decree 1065/2007, for the purpose of preparing the
annual return referred to above, certain information with respect to the Notes must be submitted to
the Issuer (and the Guarantor) at the time of each payment.

Such information would be the following:

a)    identification of the Notes (as applicable) in respect of which the relevant payment is made;

b)    date on which relevant payment is made;

c)    the total amount of the relevant payment; and

d)    the amount of the relevant payment and to each entity that manages each clearing and
settlement system for securities situated outside Spain.

In particular, the Issuing and Paying Agent must certify the information above about the Notes by
means of a certificate.


-----

In light of the above, the Issuer (and the Guarantor) and the Issuing and Paying Agent have arranged
certain procedures to facilitate the collection of information concerning the Notes. The procedures for
providing documentation referred to in this section are set out in detail in the Indenture which may be
inspected during normal business hours at the specified office of the Issuing and Paying Agent.

**Portuguese Tax Considerations**
The information below provides a general description of the tax rules applicable to the acquisition,
ownership and subsequent transfer of the Notes under Portuguese tax law in force as of the date of
this offering memorandum, and does not take into account any developments or amendments thereof
after that date whether or not such developments or amendments have retroactive effect. This section
does not intend to deal with all aspects of Portuguese taxation that relate to investment in the Notes
or that may be relevant to particular investors in light of their personal investment circumstances.
Prospective purchasers of the Notes are advised to consult their own tax advisors as to the tax
consequences of holding the Notes.

**_Tax treatment of individuals with tax residence in Portugal_**

_Interest on the Notes and disposal of the Notes_
Interest and other investment income obtained by Portuguese resident individuals or by a nonPortuguese resident individual having a permanent establishment in the Portuguese territory to which
income are imputable on the Notes is subject to Personal Income Tax. If the interest income is paid or
made available through a Portuguese resident entity or a Portuguese branch of a non-resident entity
(Portuguese paying agent), such payments will be subject to final withholding taxation at a flat rate of
28%. When subject to final withholding tax the income does not need to be included in the yearly tax
return.

The individual may nonetheless opt for the aggregation of such income with the remaining taxable
income, which is subject to tax at progressive rates up to 48% (additional solidarity income tax herein
excluded but due as detailed below), plus an extraordinary surtax levied at a progressive rate up to
3.21%. Additional solidarity surtax will be due on the part of the taxable income exceeding €80,000 as
follows: (i) 2.5% on the part of the taxable income exceeding €80,000 up to €250,000 and (ii) 5% on
the remaining part (if any) of the taxable income exceeding €250,000. In this case, the tax already
withheld is considered as payment on account of the final tax due.

If interest is not derived through a Portuguese paying agent, the income is not subject to withholding
taxation in Portugal at the time of the payment but the taxpayer is required to include the income in
the yearly tax return and apply an autonomous flat rate of 28%, unless an option for aggregation is
made (in which case taxation is due under the rules of the previous paragraph).

Resident beneficiaries are entitled under certain circumstances to claim an appropriate credit for any
foreign withholding tax against their personal income tax liability.

Non-habitual resident individuals in Portugal may be exempt from investment income arising from the
Notes issued by non-resident entities, under certain circumstances.

The disposal of the Notes by a Portuguese resident individual may generate capital gains taxed at a
flat rate of 28% levied on the positive difference between the capital gains and capital losses realized
each year on the transfer of securities and derivatives, unless the individual elects to include such
income in his taxable income, in which case it will be subject to tax at progressive income tax rates of
up to 48% plus an extraordinary surtax levied at a progressive rate up to 3.21%. An additional
solidarity income tax will be due on the part of the taxable income exceeding €80,000 as follows: (i)
2.5% on the part of the taxable income exceeding €80,000 up to €250,000 and (ii) 5% on the
remaining part (if any) of the taxable income exceeding €250,000.

The computation of the annual balance of gains and losses for income tax purposes does not include
losses arising from transactions entered into with counterparts resident in a country, territory or region
subject to a more favorable tax regime, listed in Ministerial Order 150/2004 of 13 February (as
amended from time to time).

No stamp tax applies to the acquisition through gift or inheritance of Notes by an individual. A 10%
stamp tax will apply to the acquisition through gift or inheritance of Notes deposited in Portugal,


-----

however an exemption applies to close family members (i.e. gifts or inheritance between father and
son or between spouses). There is no wealth or estate tax in Portugal.

**_Corporations resident in Portugal for tax purposes or permanent establishments in Portugal of_**
**_non-Portuguese tax residents_**

_Interest on the Notes and disposal of the Notes_
Interest income and capital gains derived from the disposal of the Notes by legal persons resident for
tax purposes in Portugal or attributable to a permanent establishment in Portugal of a non-resident
entity are included in their taxable base and subject to corporate tax at a rate of 21%. An additional
municipal surtax (derrama municipal) of up to 1.5% of the taxable profit may apply. A state surtax
(derrama estadual) of 3% on the portion of taxable profits which exceeds €1,500,000, of 5% on the
portion of taxable profits which exceeds €7,500,000 and of 7% on the portion of taxable profits which
exceeds €35,000,000 is also applicable.

A CIT exemption may apply to specific entities (such as pension funds, retirement and/or education
savings funds, share savings funds and venture capital funds constituted under the laws of Portugal).

Non-exempt resident beneficiaries are entitled to claim an appropriate credit for any foreign
withholding tax against their final corporate income tax liability.

The acquisition of Notes through gift by a Portuguese resident legal person or attributable to a
Portuguese permanent establishment of a non-resident entity is also subject to corporate tax at a rate
of 21%. The surtaxes mentioned above may also apply.

**Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations**
The following is a summary of certain material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the
acquisition, ownership and disposition of Notes by a U.S. Holder (as defined below). This summary
deals only with initial purchasers of Notes at the issue price that are U.S. Holders and that will hold
the Notes as capital assets. The summary does not cover all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation
that may be relevant to, or the actual tax effect that any of the matters described herein will have on,
the acquisition, ownership or disposition of Notes by particular investors, and does not address any
tax consequences arising under U.S. federal estate and gift tax laws or under the laws of any state,
local, non-U.S. or other taxing jurisdiction. This summary also does not discuss all the tax
considerations that may be relevant to certain types of investors subject to special treatment under
the U.S. federal income tax laws (such as financial institutions, insurance companies, investors liable
for the alternative minimum tax, individual retirement accounts and other tax-deferred accounts, taxexempt organizations, dealers in securities or currencies, traders that elect to mark to market, real
estate investment trusts, regulated investment companies, grantor trusts, investors that will hold the
Notes as part of straddles, hedging transactions or conversion transactions for U.S. federal income
tax purposes or investors whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar).

As used herein, the term “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of Notes that is, for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, (i) an individual citizen or resident of the U.S., (ii) a corporation (or any other
entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized under the
laws of the U.S., any State thereof or the District of Columbia, (iii) an estate the income of which is
subject to U.S. federal income tax without regard to its source or (iv) a trust if a court within the U.S.
is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S.
persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or the trust has elected to
be treated as a domestic trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

The U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in a partnership (or other entity or arrangement
treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) that holds Notes will depend on the
status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Prospective purchasers that are
partnerships (or other entities or arrangements treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax
purposes) should consult their tax advisers concerning the U.S. federal income tax consequences to
their partners of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of Notes by the partnership.

The summary is based on the tax laws of the U.S., including the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the “Code”), its legislative history, existing and proposed regulations thereunder, published


-----

rulings and court decisions, all as of the date hereof and all subject to change at any time, possibly
with retroactive effect.

**THE SUMMARY OF U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES SET OUT BELOW IS FOR**
**GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY. ALL PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR**
**TAX ADVISERS AS TO THE PARTICULAR TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF OWNING THE**
**NOTES, INCLUDING THE APPLICABILITY AND EFFECT OF STATE, LOCAL, FOREIGN AND**
**OTHER TAX LAWS AND POSSIBLE CHANGES IN TAX LAW.**

**Characterization of the Notes**
No authority directly addresses the characterization of securities like the Notes for U.S. federal
income tax purposes and no ruling will be received from the IRS as to the characterization of the
Notes for such purposes. To the extent relevant for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Issuer
intends to treat the Notes as indebtedness for such purposes consistent with their form. It is possible,
however, that the Notes could be treated as equity interests in the Issuer. No assurance can be given
that the IRS will not assert, or a court would not sustain, a position regarding the characterization of
the Notes that is contrary to this discussion. If the Notes were treated as equity interests in the Issuer,
U.S. Holders may be treated as owning interests in a passive foreign investment company (or
“PFIC”), which could have materially adverse tax consequences for a U.S. Holder. Prospective
investors should seek advice from their own tax advisers as to the consequences to them of
alternative characterizations of the Notes, the possibility that the Notes will be classified as equity
interests in a PFIC and the consequences of owning an equity interest in a PFIC. The discussion
below assumes that the Notes will be treated as debt for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

**_Payments of interest_**
“Qualified stated interest” paid by the Issuer on the Notes (including any amounts withheld and any
Additional Amounts paid in respect of withholding taxes imposed on payments on the Notes) will
generally be taxable to a U.S. Holder as ordinary income at the time it is received or accrued,
depending on the U.S. Holder’s method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The term
“qualified stated interest” generally means stated interest that is unconditionally payable in cash or in
property, other than debt instruments of the Issuer, at least annually at a qualifying rate during the
entire term of the Note. The Issuer expects that stated interest on the Notes will be treated as
qualified stated interest.

If the issue price of the Notes is less than their principal amount by more than a de minimis amount,
U.S. Holders will be subject to special U.S. federal income tax rules with respect to this original issue
discount (“OID”). Generally, OID will be considered to be de minimis if it is less than .25% of the
principal amount multiplied by the number of complete years to maturity. U.S. Holders will be required
to include any OID in income for U.S. federal tax purposes as it accrues in accordance with a
constant yield method based on a compounding of interest, even though the cash attributable to this
income will not be received until the Notes are sold, exchanged or retired. U.S. Holders should
consult their own tax advisers concerning how to account for any OID that may accrue on the Notes.

The amount of interest income recognized by a cash basis U.S. Holder will be the U.S. dollar value of
the qualified stated interest payment, based on the “spot rate” (as such term is defined in the U.S.
Treasury Regulations) on the date of receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted
into U.S. dollars.

An accrual basis U.S. Holder may determine the amount of income recognized with respect to a
qualified stated interest payment denominated in Euro in accordance with either of two methods.
Under the first method, the amount of income accrued will be based on the average spot rate in effect
during the interest accrual period (or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years of
a U.S. Holder, the part of the period within the taxable year).

Under the second method, the accrual basis U.S. Holder may elect to determine the amount of
income accrued on the basis of the spot rate in effect on the last day of the accrual period (or, in the
case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years, the spot rate in effect on the last day of the
part of the period within the taxable year). Additionally, if a payment of interest is actually received
within five business days of the last day of the accrual period, an electing accrual basis U.S. Holder
may instead translate the accrued interest into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect on the day


-----

of actual receipt. Any such election will apply to all debt instruments held by the U.S. Holder at the
beginning of the first taxable year to which the election applies or thereafter acquired by the U.S.
Holder, and will be irrevocable without the consent of the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS ”).

Rules similar to those applicable to accrual basis U.S. Holders with respect to income from qualified
stated interest payments will apply to cash basis and accrual basis U.S. Holders with respect to OID.

Upon receipt of the interest payment (including a payment attributable to accrued but unpaid interest
upon the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note) denominated in Euros, the
accrual basis U.S. Holder will generally recognize U.S. source exchange gain or loss (taxable as
ordinary income or loss) equal to the difference, if any, between the amount received (translated into
U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the date of receipt) and the amount that was taken into income in the
manner described above, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars.

Interest income will generally constitute foreign source “passive category” income for foreign tax
credit purposes. The rules relating to foreign tax credits and the timing thereof are complex and a
U.S. Holder should consult its own tax adviser regarding the availability of a foreign tax credit and the
application of the foreign tax credit limitations to their particular situation.

**_Disposition of the Notes_**
A U.S. Holder will generally recognize gain or loss on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable
disposition of a Note equal to the difference between the amount realized on the disposition (less an
amount equal to any accrued but unpaid qualified stated interest, which will be taxable as interest
income to the extent not previously included in income) and the U.S. Holder’s tax basis of the Note. A
U.S. Holder’s tax basis in a Note will generally be its U.S. dollar cost (as defined below), decreased
by any cash payments on the Note other than qualified stated interest and increased by OID included
in income. The U.S. dollar cost of a Note purchased with Euro will generally be the U.S. dollar value
of the purchase price on the date of purchase, or the settlement date for the purchase, in the case of
Notes traded on an established securities market, within the meaning of the applicable U.S. Treasury
Regulations, that are purchased by a cash basis U.S. Holder (or an accrual basis U.S. Holder that so
elects). The amount realized on a sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition for an
amount in Euros will be the U.S. dollar value of this amount on the date of the disposition, or the
settlement date of the disposition, in the case of Notes traded on an established securities market,
within the meaning of the applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations, sold by a cash basis U.S. Holder (or
an accrual basis U.S. Holder that so elects). The election available to accrual basis U.S. Holders in
regards to the purchase and sale of Notes traded on an established securities market must be
applied consistently to all debt instruments from year to year and cannot be changed without the
consent of the IRS.

A U.S. Holder will recognize U.S. source exchange rate gain or loss (taxable as ordinary income or
loss) on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note equal to the difference,
if any, between the U.S. dollar values of (i) the principal amount of the Note, determined on the date
of disposition and (ii) the principal amount of the Note on the date on which the U.S. Holder acquired
the Note. Any such exchange rate gain or loss (including any exchange gain or loss with respect to
the receipt of accrued but unpaid interest) will be realized only to the extent of total gain or loss
realized on the sale or retirement. Gain or loss realized on a sale, exchange or retirement of a Note
that is attributable to fluctuation in currency exchange rates will be ordinary income or loss.

Except to the extent attributable to changes in exchange rates, gain or loss recognized by a U.S.
Holder on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note will be capital gain or
loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the Note was held by the U.S. Holder for more than
one year. Long-term capital gains recognized by an individual U.S. holder generally are subject to tax
at a lower rate than short-term capital gains or ordinary income. The deductibility of capital losses is
subject to significant limitations.

Gain or loss realized by a U.S. Holder on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition
of a Note generally will be U.S. source. Prospective purchasers should consult their tax advisers as
to the foreign tax credit implications of the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of
Notes.


-----

**_Backup withholding and information reporting_**
Payments of principal and interest on, and the proceeds of sale, exchange, retirement or other
taxable disposition of Notes may be reported to the IRS and to the U.S. Holder. Backup withholding
may apply to these payments if the U.S. Holder fails to provide an accurate taxpayer identification
number or otherwise comply with the backup withholding rules. Backup withholding is not an
additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund
or a credit against a U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability provided the required information is
timely furnished to the IRS.

U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding any additional tax reporting or filing
requirements they may have as a result of the acquisition, ownership or disposition of the Notes.
Failure to comply with applicable reporting obligations could result in the imposition of substantial
penalties.

# Certain ERISA Considerations

The following is a summary of certain considerations associated with the purchase of the Notes by
employee benefit plans that are subject to Title I of the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), plans, individual retirement accounts and other arrangements
that are subject to Section 4975 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
“Code”) or provisions under any other federal, state, local, non-U.S. or other laws or regulations that
are similar to such provisions of ERISA or the Code (collectively, “Similar Laws”), and entities whose
underlying assets are considered to include “plan assets” of such plans, accounts and arrangements
pursuant to the U.S. Department of Labor “plan assets” regulation, 29 CFR Section 2510.3-101, as
amended by Section 3(42) of ERISA (each, a “Plan”).

**General Fiduciary Matters**
ERISA and the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of a Plan subject to Title I
of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (an “ERISA Plan”) and prohibit certain transactions involving
the assets of an ERISA Plan and its fiduciaries or other interested parties. Under ERISA and the
Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of such
an ERISA Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of such an ERISA Plan, or who
renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation to such an ERISA Plan, is generally
considered to be a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan.

In considering an investment in the Notes of a portion of the assets of any Plan, a fiduciary should
determine whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing
the Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law relating to the
fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including, without limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of
control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable Similar
Laws.

**Prohibited Transaction Laws**
Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit ERISA Plans from engaging in specified
transactions involving plan assets with persons or entities who are “parties in interest”, within the
meaning of Section 3(14) of ERISA, or “disqualified persons”, within the meaning of Section 4975 of
the Code, unless an exemption is available. A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in
a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities
under ERISA and the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of the ERISA Plan that engaged in such a nonexempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and/or the
Code.

The acquisition and/or holding of the Notes by a Plan with respect to which the Issuer is a party in
interest or a disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction
under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and
is held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction
exemption. In this regard, the U.S. Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class
exemptions (“PTCEs”) that may apply to the acquisition and holding of the Notes. These class
exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 respecting transactions determined by
independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1 respecting insurance company
pooled separate accounts, PTCE 91-38 respecting bank collective investment funds, PTCE 95-60
respecting life insurance company general accounts and PTCE 96-23 respecting transactions
determined by in-house asset managers. There can be no assurance that any class exemption or any
other exemption will be available with respect to any particular transaction involving the Notes, or that
if an exemption is available, it will cover all aspects of any particular transaction.

**Representation**
Accordingly, by acceptance of a Note or any interest therein, each purchaser and holder will be
deemed to have represented and warranted that either (i) it is not acquiring or holding the Note with
the assets of a Plan, or (ii) the acquisition and holding of the Notes will not result in a non-exempt
prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a similar violation
under any applicable Similar Laws.


-----

None of the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Trustee (each, a “Transaction Party”) is undertaking to
provide impartial investment advice, or to give advice in a fiduciary capacity, in connection with the
acquisition of any of the Notes by any Plan. Each Plan fiduciary who is responsible for making the
investment decisions whether to purchase or commit to purchase and to hold Notes should determine
whether, under the general fiduciary standards of investment prudence and diversification and under
the documents and instruments governing the Plan, an investment in such Notes is appropriate for
the Plan, taking into account the overall investment policy of the Plan and the composition of the
Plan’s investment portfolio. Any Plan proposing to invest in Notes should consult with its counsel to
confirm that such investment will not result in a prohibited transaction and will satisfy the other
requirements of ERISA and the Code. Fiduciaries of plans subject to any Similar Law should confirm
that an investment in the Notes will not result in a violation of such Similar Law.

In addition, any Plan or a fiduciary purchasing the Notes on behalf of a Plan or who represents the
Plan with respect to such purchase, should consider the impact of the new Department of Labor
regulations promulgated at 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-21 on April 8, 2016 (81 Fed. Reg. 20,997) (the
“Fiduciary Rule”).

Each purchaser of the Notes that is a Plan, including any fiduciary purchasing the Notes on behalf of
a Plan or who represents the Plan with respect to such purchase, will be deemed to have
represented by its purchase of the Notes that: (1) none of the Transaction Parties has provided or will
provide advice with respect to the acquisition of the Notes by the Plan; (2) with respect to the
purchase of the Notes, the Plan is represented by a fiduciary (the “Plan Fiduciary”) that either: (a) is a
bank as defined in Section 202 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the “Advisers Act”), or similar
institution that is regulated and supervised and subject to periodic examination by a state or federal
agency; (b) is an insurance carrier which is qualified under the laws of more than one state to
perform the services of managing, acquiring or disposing of assets of a Plan; (c) is an investment
adviser registered under the Advisers Act, or, if not registered an as investment adviser under the
Advisers Act by reason of paragraph (1) of Section 203A of the Advisers Act, is registered as an
investment adviser under the laws of the state in which it maintains its principal office and place of
business; (d) is a broker-dealer registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended;
or (e) has, and at all times that the Plan is invested in the Notes will have, total assets of at least U.S.
$50,000,000 under its management or control (provided that this clause (e) shall not be satisfied if
the Plan Fiduciary is either (i) the owner or a relative of the owner of an investing individual
retirement account or (ii) a participant or beneficiary of the Plan investing in the Notes in such
capacity); (3) the Plan Fiduciary is capable of evaluating investment risks independently, both in
general and with respect to particular transactions and investment strategies, including without
limitation the acquisition by the Plan of the Notes; (4) the Plan Fiduciary is a “fiduciary” with respect to
the Plan within the meaning of Section 3(21) of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code, or both, is
“independent” within the meaning of 29 C.F.R. § 2510.3-21(c) and is independent of the Transaction
Parties for purposes of the Fiduciary Rule and responsible for exercising independent judgment in
evaluating the Plan’s acquisition of the Notes; (5) none of the Transaction Parties has exercised any
authority to cause the Plan to invest in the Notes or to negotiate the terms of the Plan’s investment in
the Notes; and (6) the Plan Fiduciary has been informed by the Transaction Parties: (a) that none of
the Transaction Parties has undertaken or will undertake to provide impartial investment advice or
has given or will give advice in a fiduciary capacity in connection with the Plan’s acquisition of the
Notes; (b) of the existence and nature of the fees, compensation arrangements and/or financial
interests of the Transaction Parties in the Plan’s acquisition of the Notes; and (c) that none of the
Transaction Parties receives a fee or other compensation from the Plan for the provision of
investment advice. The above representations in this paragraph are intended to comply with the
Fiduciary Rule. If the Department of Labor regulation 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-21(c)(1) is revoked,
repealed or no longer effective, the representations in this paragraph that are responsive to such
Department of Labor regulation shall be deemed to not be in effect.

The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all-inclusive. Due to the
complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in nonexempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries, or other persons
considering purchasing the Notes on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their
counsel regarding the potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar
Laws to such investment and whether an exemption would be applicable to the purchase and holding
of the Notes.

# Plan of Distribution

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in a purchase agreement to be dated the date of the
final offering memorandum (the “Purchase Agreement”), the Issuer has agreed to sell to each Initial
Purchaser, and each Initial Purchaser has agreed, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the
Issuer the Notes. The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to
pay for and accept delivery of the Notes are subject to, among other customary closing conditions,
the delivery of certain legal opinions by counsel.

The Issuer has agreed to pay the Initial Purchasers certain customary fees for their services in
connection with the Offering and to reimburse them for certain out-of-pocket expenses.

The Fixed Rate Notes and the Floating Rate Notes will initially be offered at the respective price
indicated on the cover page of this offering memorandum. After the initial offering, the offering price
and other selling terms of the Fixed Rate Notes and/or the Floating Rate Notes may from time to time
be varied by the Initial Purchasers without notice. The Initial Purchasers may use affiliates or other
appropriately licensed entities for sales of the Fixed Rate Notes and the Floating Rate Notes, as
applicable, in jurisdictions in which they are otherwise not permitted.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the Issuer and each Guarantor will indemnify the Initial
Purchasers against certain liabilities, including certain liabilities under the U.S. Securities Act, and will
contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof.

During a period of 90 days from the date of the this offering memorandum, no company of the Group
will offer for sale, sell, contract to sell, grant an option for the sale of, or otherwise dispose of, directly
or indirectly (except through the Initial Purchasers or with the prior written consent of the Initial
Purchasers), any other debt securities or preferred equity securities issued or guaranteed by any
company of the Group (other than the Notes) or securities of any company of the Group that are
convertible into, or exchangeable with, the Notes or such other debt securities or preferred equity
securities.

The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act. The Initial
Purchasers have agreed that they will only offer or sell the Notes (a) in the U.S. to persons
reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the U.S.
Securities Act, and (b) outside the U.S. in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the
U.S. Securities Act. Terms used above have the meanings given to them by Rule 144A and
Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act.

Until 40 days after the date the Notes are originally issued, an offer or sale of the Notes within the
U.S. by a dealer that is not participating in the Offering may violate the registration requirements of
the U.S. Securities Act if that offer or sale is made otherwise than in accordance with Rule 144A.

Each Initial Purchaser has represented that it (i) has only communicated or caused to be
communicated and will only communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement
to engage in investment activity, within the meaning of section 21 of FSMA, received by it in
connection with the issuance or sale of the Fixed Rate Notes or the Floating Rate Notes, as
applicable, in circumstances in which section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer or any
Guarantor and (ii) has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with
respect to anything done by it in relation to the Fixed Rate Notes or the Floating Rate Notes, as
applicable, in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.

The Notes will constitute a new class of securities with no established trading market. Application will
be made for the Notes to be listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and
admitted to trading on the Euro MTF market thereof. However, there can be no assurance that the
prices at which the Notes will sell in the market after the Offering will not be lower than the initial
offering price or that an active trading market for the Notes will develop and continue after the
Offering. The Initial Purchasers (or persons acting on their behalf) have advised the Issuer that they
currently intend to make a market in the Notes. However, the Initial Purchasers are not obligated to
do so, and may discontinue any market-making activities with respect to the Notes at any time
without notice. In addition, market-making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the U.S.
Securities Act and the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “U.S. Exchange Act”), and may be


-----

limited. Accordingly, there can be no assurance as to the liquidity of or the trading market for the
Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes—There may not be an active trading market
_for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be limited”._

In connection with this Offering, the Initial Purchasers are not acting for anyone other than us and will
not be responsible to anyone other than us for providing the protections afforded to their clients or for
providing advice in relation to this Offering.

Buyers of the Notes sold by the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp taxes, taxes and
other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the
initial offering price set forth on the cover of this offering memorandum.

The Issuer expects that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the Notes on or about
the date specified on the cover page of this offering memorandum, which will be business
days (as such term is used for the purposes of Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act) following the
date of pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as “T+ ”). Under Rule
15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in
two business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly,
purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of this offering memorandum or the next
succeeding business days will be required to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any
such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such trades
should consult their own advisors.

In connection with the issue of the Notes, J.P. Morgan Securities plc or persons acting on its behalf
may over-allot Notes or effect transactions with a view to supporting the market price of the Notes at
a level higher than that which might otherwise prevail. However, there is no assurance that J.P.
Morgan Securities plc or persons acting on its behalf will undertake stabilization action. Any
stabilization action may begin on or after the date on which adequate public disclosure of the terms of
the offer of Notes is made and, if begun, may be ended at any time, but it must end no later than the
earlier of 30 days after the Issue Date and 60 days after the date of the allotment of the Notes.

An affiliate of J.P. Morgan is acting as a financial advisor to certain of the Sellers in connection with
the Acquisition. The proceeds of the Offering will be used to partially fund the Acquisition. See “Use of
_Proceeds”. Certain Initial Purchasers or their affiliates are acting as arrangers and lenders under, and_
certain other Initial Purchasers are expected to be lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility.
Macquarie Capital (Europe) Limited (“Macquarie Capital”) is acting as a financial adviser to Bidco in
connection with the Acquisition and is an Initial Purchaser. The proceeds of the Offering will be used
to partially fund the Acquisition. Bidco is managed by Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets
(Europe) Limited (“MIRAEL”), a member of the Macquarie Group. MIRAEL is an indirect subsidiary of
Macquarie Group Limited, which is the ultimate parent of Macquarie Capital.

The Initial Purchasers and/or their affiliates may also receive allocations of the Notes. In addition, the
Initial Purchasers have provided certain debt financing commitments to provide financing for the
Acquisition in the event the Offerings are not consummated, and will receive customary fees and
commissions for their services in such capacities and reimbursement expenses. JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A. is acting as Escrow Agent for the Notes. The proceeds of the Offering will be used to
partially fund the Acquisition. The Initial Purchasers and/or their affiliates may also enter into hedging
arrangements with us in connection with the Transactions. The Initial Purchasers and/or their affiliates
will serve as arrangers, bookrunners and lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and
have received, or may in the future receive, customary fees and commissions for these transactions.
Certain of the Initial Purchasers are affiliates of shareholders of Empark. See “Principal Shareholder”.

A portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the Notes in this Offering will be used to make the
Debt Repayment. Certain of the Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates hold or in the
future may hold certain of the Existing Notes to be repurchased with a portion of the proceeds of this
offering and as a result may receive proceeds from the issuance of the Notes or the Additional Notes,
as applicable, in their capacities as holders of such notes. Certain of the Initial Purchasers and/or
their respective affiliates are lenders and/or arrangers under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement and may be lenders under the Project Finance Facilities and as a result, in their
capacities as lenders thereunder, will receive a portion of the proceeds of the Offering. The Initial
Purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various


-----

activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial
advisory, investment management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities.
Certain of the Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates from time to time have provided in
the past and may provide in the future investment banking, financial advisory and/or commercial
banking services to us and/or our affiliates (or former affiliates) in the ordinary course of business, for
which they have received or may receive customary fees, commissions and reimbursement of
expenses. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations
and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial
instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in
such securities and instruments. In the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial
Purchasers and their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt
and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans)
for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities
activities may involve securities and instruments of the Issuer or its affiliates. If the Initial Purchasers
or their respective affiliates have a lending relationship with the Issuer, they routinely hedge their
credit exposure to the Issuer consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, the
Initial Purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which
consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in the Issuer’s
securities, including potentially the Notes offered hereby. Any such short positions could adversely
affect future trading prices of the Notes offered hereby or may have the effect of preventing or
retarding a decline in the market price of the Notes or the Additional Notes, as applicable. The Initial
Purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and publish or express
independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or
recommend to clients that they acquire, long and short positions in such securities and instruments.

# Notice to Investors

_You are advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any offer, resale, pledge or other transfer of_
_any of the Notes offered hereby._

The Notes and the Note Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the U.S.
Securities Act, or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, and, unless so registered, may not be
offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the
registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and the securities laws of any other applicable
jurisdiction. Accordingly, the Notes offered hereby are being offered and sold only to qualified
institutional buyers (as defined in Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act) in reliance on Rule 144A
under the U.S. Securities Act and in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the U.S.
Securities Act.

We use the terms “offshore transaction” and “United States” with the meanings given to them in

or the offer or sale of any of the Notes, other than the information contained elsewhere in this
offering memorandum, which offering memorandum has been delivered to it and upon which it
is relying in making its investment decision with respect to the Notes. It acknowledges that
neither the Initial Purchasers nor any person representing the Initial Purchasers make any
representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of this offering memorandum. It

opportunity to ask questions of, and request information from, the Issuer and the Initial
Purchasers.

(4)   The purchaser is purchasing the Notes for its own account, or for one or more investor
accounts for which it is acting as a fiduciary or agent, in each case for investment, and not with

the later of the date of the original issue and the last date on which we or any of our affiliates
were the owner of such Notes (or any predecessor thereto) only (i) to us, (ii) pursuant to a
registration statement that has been declared effective under the U.S. Securities Act, (iii) for so
long as the Notes are eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act, to

Restriction Termination Date.

(6)   Each purchaser and holder of a Note represents and agrees that either (i) it is not acquiring or
holding the Note with the assets of a Plan, or (ii) the acquisition and holding of the Notes will
not result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975

such Department of Labor regulation shall be deemed to not be in effect.

(8)   Each purchaser acknowledges that each Rule 144A Note will contain a legend substantially to
the following effect:

“THIS NOTE HAS NOT BEEN AND WILL NOT BE REGISTERED UNDER THE U.S.
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE “U.S. SECURITIES ACT”), OR OTHER

# Enforcement of Civil Liabilities

The Issuer is incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg and none of its directors are residents of
the United States. Furthermore, a substantial portion of the Issuer’s assets and a substantial portion
of the assets of such persons are located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be
possible for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon the Issuer or such
persons, or to enforce against them judgments of U.S. courts predicated upon the civil liability
provisions of U.S. federal or state securities laws.

If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. court against the Issuer or a Guarantor, purchasers will need to
enforce such judgment in jurisdictions where the relevant company has assets. Even though the
enforceability of U.S. court judgments outside the United States is described below for the countries
in which the Issuer and the Guarantors are located, you should consult with your own advisors in any
pertinent jurisdictions as needed to enforce a judgment in those countries or elsewhere outside the
United States.

**Luxembourg**
We have been advised by our Luxembourg counsel that the United States and Luxembourg are not
currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other
than arbitral awards rendered in civil and commercial matters. According to such counsel, an
enforceable judgment for the payment of monies rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based
on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon the U.S. securities laws, would not be directly
enforceable in Luxembourg. However, a party who received such favorable judgment from a U.S.
state or federal court, may initiate enforcement proceedings in Luxembourg (exequatur) by requesting
enforcement of the U.S. judgment by the District Court (Tribunal d’Arrondissement) pursuant to Article
678 et seq. of the Luxembourg Nouveau Code de Procédure Civile. The District Court will authorize
the enforcement in Luxembourg of the U.S. judgment if it is satisfied that all of the following
conditions are met:

-    the U.S. court awarding the judgment has jurisdiction to adjudicate the respective matter under
its applicable U.S. federal or state jurisdictions rules, and the jurisdiction of such U.S. court is
recognized by Luxembourg private international and local law;

-    the U.S. judgment is final and enforceable (exécutoire) in the United States;

-    the U.S. court has applied the substantive law as designated by the Luxembourg conflict of
laws rules or, at least, the court order must not contravene the principles underlying those
rules;

-    the U.S. court must have applied the proper law to the matter submitted to it and has acted in
accordance with its own procedural laws;

-    the U.S. judgment must not have been obtained subsequent to an evasion of Luxembourg law
(fraude à la loi luxembourgeoise) and must have been granted following proceedings where the
counterparty had the opportunity to appear, and if appeared, to present a defense; and

-    the U.S. judgment does not contravene international public policy or order as understood under
the laws of Luxembourg and has not been given in proceedings of a criminal, penal or tax
nature (which would include awards of damages made under civil liabilities provisions of the
U.S. federal securities laws, or other laws, to the extent that the same would be classified by
Luxembourg courts as being of a penal or punitive nature (for example, fines or punitive
damages)).

Subject to the above conditions, Luxembourg courts tend not to review the merits of a foreign
judgment, although there is no clear statutory prohibition of such review.

We have also been advised by our Luxembourg counsel that if an original action is brought in
Luxembourg, Luxembourg courts may refuse to apply the designated law (i) if the choice of such law
was not made bona fide, or (ii) if the foreign law was not pleaded and proved or (iii) if pleaded and
proved, such foreign law would be contrary to mandatory Luxembourg laws or manifestly
incompatible with Luxembourg public policy or public order rules. In an action brought in Luxembourg


-----

on the basis of U.S. federal or state securities laws, Luxembourg courts may not have the requisite
power to grant the remedies sought. Also, an exequatur may be refused in respect of punitive
damages.

Further, in the event of any proceedings being brought in a Luxembourg court in respect of a
monetary obligation expressed to be payable in a currency other than euro, a Luxembourg court
would have power to give judgment expressed as an order to pay a currency other than euro.
However, enforcement of the judgment against any party in Luxembourg would be available only in
euro and for such purposes all claims or debts would be converted into euro.

**Spain and Portugal**
Empark and certain other of the Subsidiary Guarantors are organized under the laws of Spain with
limited liability. The controlling shareholders of Empark, and the directors and the executive officers of
Empark and the other Spanish Guarantors are non-residents of the United States and a significant
portion of the assets of such persons are located outside the United States. As a result, the
enforcement in Spain of a judgment entered in another jurisdiction (other than a EU Member State),
must be made in accordance with the Spanish Law 29/2015 of July 31, on International Legal
Cooperation on Civil Matters (hereinafter, the “ILCC Law”) in connection with Article 523.2 and the
derogation provision of the Spanish Civil Procedural Law (1/2000, 7 de enero, de Enjuiciamento Civil)
(“LEC 2000”). An investor may also experience difficulty in effecting service of process on or
enforcing judgments against such persons or Empark or the other Spanish Guarantors based on civil
liability provisions of the U.S. federal and state securities laws or other laws.

We have been advised by our Spanish counsel that, at the moment, the United States and Spain are
not currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments.

A party in whose favor such judgment was rendered could initiate enforcement proceedings
(exequatur) in Spain before the relevant Court of First Instance (Tribunal de Primera Instancia) or the
Commercial Court (Juzgado de lo Mercantil), as the case may be. According to the ILCC Law,
recognition and enforcement in Spain of such U.S. judgment could be obtained provided that none of
the circumstances set forth in article 46 of the ILCC apply:

-    that the judgment is contrary to Spanish public policy (“órden público”);

-    that the judgment has been rendered by clearly breaching the rights of defense of any of the
parties and, in particular, if the judgment has been rendered by default of the defendant (“en
_rebeldía”), it would be deemed to breach his rights of defense if the defendant was not_
regularly and timely notified to enable it to defend itself properly;

-    that the subject matter in respect of which the judgment has been rendered falls within the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Spanish courts or, in any other matters, if the foreign court
jurisdiction does not have a reasonable connection with the dispute;

-    that the foreign judgment is incompatible with other Spanish judgments;

-    that the foreign judgment is incompatible with another country’s judgment which meets the
requirements to be enforceable in Spain; or

-    that there is an ongoing proceeding between the same parties and dealing with the same
subject which was opened before a Spanish court prior to the opening of the proceedings
before the foreign court.

According to Article 3.2 of ILCC, Law the Spanish Government may deny cooperation with other
state’s authorities if there has been a reiteration refusal of cooperation or a legal prohibition of
providing cooperation by such other state’s authorities provided that the Spanish Government passes
a Royal Decree for these purposes.

In addition, the discovery process under actions filed in the United States could be adversely affected
under certain circumstances by Spanish law (relating to communication of documents and information
of an economic, commercial, industrial, financial or technical nature to foreign authorities or persons),
which could prohibit or restrict obtaining evidence in Spain or from Spanish persons in connection
with a judicial or administrative U.S. action.


-----

Any judgment obtained against either the Issuer or any of the Spanish Guarantors in any country
bound by the provisions of EU Regulation 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council
would be recognized and enforced in Spain in accordance with the terms set forth thereby (“EU
_Regulation 1215/2012”)._

The Spanish Courts may not recognize or enforce a judgment given by the courts of an EU Member
State if:

a)    it would be manifestly contrary to Spanish public policy;

b)    the judgment was given in default of appearance and the defendant was not served with
process in sufficient time and in such a way to enable it to arrange for its defense unless the
defendant failed to commence proceedings to challenge the judgment in the jurisdiction where
the judgment was rendered when it was possible for if to do so;

c)    the judgment is irreconcilable with a judgment given in a dispute between the same parties in
Spain;

d)    the judgment is irreconcilable with an earlier judgment given in another Member State or in a
third State involving the same cause of action and between the same parties and the earlier
judgment fulfils the conditions necessary for its recognition in Spain; or

e)    the party against which enforcement is sought is subject to insolvency proceedings and the
requirements established in Regulation 2016/848 and/or the Spanish Insolvency Law are not
met.

The enforcement of any judgments in Spain will be subject to article 54.4 of the ILCC Law and,
among others, the following formal requirements: (a) documents in a language other than Spanish
must be accompanied by a translation into Spanish (translator’s fees will be payable); (b) certain
professional fees are required for the verification of the legal authority of a party litigating in Spain if
needed; (c) the payment of certain court agent, lawyer and court fees and (d) the procedural acts of a
party litigating in Spain shall be directed by an attorney at law and the party shall be represented by a
court agent with the exception of enforcements of judgments issued in a proceeding in which such
direction and representation is not needed. In addition, rules governing Spanish civil proceedings
cannot be amended by agreement of the parties and will therefore prevail notwithstanding any
provision to the contrary in the Notes.

Under Spanish procedural law, process must be served personally on each defendant. The Spanish
Supreme Court, taking into account the circumstances of the case, could find that service of process
on an agent appointed by a Spanish Guarantor has infringed Spanish public policy or the rights of
defense of the Spanish Guarantors. Should this be the case, the judgment rendered in the United
States would not be recognized in Spain.

Pursuant to Article 54 of LEC 2000, the parties to an agreement are entitled to clearly submit to one
judge (juzgado) or court (tribunal) (provided that under the Spanish Procedural Law and the Spanish
Judicial Law (Ley 6/1985, de 1 de Julio, Orgánica del Poder Judicial) the relevant judge or court is
competent to solve the corresponding dispute); therefore, such article does not cover the validity of
nonexclusive jurisdiction clauses, at least for conflicts between different Spanish courts.

In the event that an action were brought before Spanish courts, a Spanish court may decide that it is
competent to hear the case even if the other party does not appear before it or appears and contests
its jurisdiction based on the fact that the Notes, Guarantees, Intercreditor Agreement or other
document is submitted to the jurisdiction of the courts of England or New York, provided, in the case
of submission to the courts of England, that the Spanish court grounds for jurisdiction is recognized
under the EU Regulation 1215/2012.

Additionally, the Spanish court will apply to the Notes, Guarantees, Intercreditor Agreement or any
other foreign law document the law chosen by the parties in the terms and with the limits provided for
in Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 2008 on
the law applicable to contractual obligations and, namely:

a)    A Spanish court may give effect to the overriding mandatory provisions of the law of the
country where the obligations arising out of the Guarantees or Notes have to be or have been
performed, insofar as those overriding mandatory provisions render the performance of such


-----

obligations unlawful. In considering whether to give effect to those provisions, regard shall be
made to their nature and purpose and to the consequences of their application or nonapplication;

b)    A Spanish court will apply the law of Spain in a situation where it is mandatory irrespective of
the law otherwise applicable to the Notes or Guarantees;

c)    A Spanish court may refuse to apply New York or English law in relation to the obligations
incurred under the Notes or Guarantees or under the Intercreditor Agreement if such
application violates the public policy (orden público) of Spain;

d)    Where all other elements relevant to the situation at the time of the choice are located in one
or more European Union Member States, the parties’ choice of New York law shall not
prejudice the application of provisions of European Union law, where appropriate as
implemented in Spain, which cannot be derogated from by agreement;

e)    A Spanish court shall have regard to the law of the country in which performance takes place in
relation to the manner of performance and the steps to be taken in the event of defective
performance; and

f)    A Spanish Court may require evidence satisfactory to them of the New York or English law in
accordance with article 281 of the Spanish Civil Procedural Law (Ley de Enjuiciamiento Civil)
and, exceptionally if the parties have not been able to evidence foreign law, Spanish Courts
may apply Spanish law pursuant to articles 281.2 of Law 1/2000 and 33 of the ILCC.

The Courts of Spain may render judgments in a currency other than Euros. However, for the
purposes of determining the assets that need to be seized for enforcement purposes, a judgment in a
foreign currency needs to be converted into Euros at the official selling rate prevailing on the date on
which the enforcement of the foreign judgment is agreed by the Courts of the Kingdom of Spain in
accordance to Article 577 of Law 1/2000. If the currency in which the relevant judgment is expressed
is not listed in any official market, the Spanish Courts shall apply the exchange rate that they deem
appropriate pursuant to the documents that are filed with the courts by the enforcing party.

Certain of the Guarantors, including Emparque, are organized under the laws of Portugal with limited
liability. The directors and the executive officers of the Portuguese Guarantors are non-residents of
the United States and a significant portion of the assets of such persons are located outside the
United States. As a result, a final and conclusive judgment by any federal or state court in the United
States (whether or not predicted solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws) would not
automatically be enforceable in Portugal and must be made in accordance with the Portuguese Code
of Civil Procedure.

We have been advised by our Portuguese counsel that the United States and Portugal are not
currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments. In the
absence of any such treaty such judgment will be recognized and enforced in Portugal according to
the procedures set out in Portuguese Code of Civil Procedure for the recognition of foreign
judgments. A final and conclusive judgment by a U.S. federal or state court would only be enforceable
in the courts of Portugal after having been reviewed and confirmed by a Portuguese court. The
Portuguese court with jurisdiction over such confirmation will be the “Tribunal da Relação” of the
judicial district where the relevant person against whom the judgment will be enforced is established.
The following requirements must be generally met - to the extent applicable: (i) there be no doubts
regarding the authenticity of the document containing the judgment, nor about the judgment’s
intelligence; (ii) the judgment be, a “condition of res judicata”, according to the laws of the U.S.,
where the judgment was rendered; (iii) that the competence of the court was not claimed fraudulently
in order to waive the applicable Portuguese laws and that the case submitted was not attributable to
the exclusive jurisdiction of the Portuguese Courts; (iv) the exceptions of “lis pendens” and of
“condition of res judicata”, cannot be argued based on a case pending or judged on a Portuguese
Court, except if the foreign court prevented the jurisdiction; (v) the defendant was duly notified to the
judgment, under the terms of the laws of the U.S., and in the judgment the adversarial nature of
proceedings was complied with, as well as the equality of the parties; and (vi) that the judgment
rendered is not incompatible with the international public policy of the Portuguese jurisdiction. This is
a judicial process that can be subject to opposition and the final court decision is also subject to
appeal.

## Report on Limited Review

 EMPARK APARCAMIENTOS Y SERVICIOS, S.A.

 Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Interim Consolidated Management Report for the 6-month period ended June 30, 2017


-----

Translation of a report and financial statements originally issued in Spanish. In the event of discrepancy, the
Spanish-language version prevails (See Note 29)

**REPORT ON LIMITED REVIEW OF INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

To the Shareholders of EMPARK APARCAMIENTOS Y SERVICIOS, S.A., at the request of Management:

**Introduction**

We have carried out a limited review of the accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial Statements
(hereinafter, interim consolidated financial statements) of EMPARK APARCAMIENTOS Y SERVICIOS, S.A.,
which consists of the Interim consolidated financial statement at June 30, 2017, the consolidated income
statement, the global consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of changes in equity, the
consolidated cash flow statement and the explanatory notes there to ( all of them condensed) for the 6-month
period then ended. The directors are responsible for the preparation of the Company’s interim consolidated
financial statements in accordance with International Accounting Standard (IAS) 34, Interim Financial Reporting,
as adopted by the European Union, for the preparation of interim financial information and for such internal
control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of interim financial statements that are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on said interim
consolidated financial statements based on our limited review.

**Scope of the review**

We conducted out limited review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements 2410,
“Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity”. A limited review of
interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and
accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A limited review is substantially less in
scope than an audit conducted in accordance with prevailing audit regulations in Spain and consequently does
not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified
in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion on the accompanying interim consolidated financial
statements.

**Conclusion**

As a result of our limited review, which under no circumstances should be considered an audit of financial
statements, nothing came to our attention that would lead us to conclude that the accompanying interim
consolidated financial statements for the 6-month period ended at June 30, 2017 are not prepared, in all material
respects, in conformity with International Accounting Standard (IAS) 34, Interim Financial Reporting, as adopted
by the European Union, for the preparation of interim financial statements.

**Emphasis of matter**

We draw attention to the matter described in accompanying explanatory note 2, which indicates that eh
abovementioned interim consolidated financial statements do not include all the information that would be
required for complete financial statements prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards, as adopted by the European Union and therefore, the accompanying interim consolidated financial
statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements for the year ended
December 31, 2016. This matter does not modify our conclusion.

**Restriction on distribution and use**

This report has been prepared at the request of EMPARK APARCAMIENTOS Y SERVICIOS, S.A.’s
Management exclusively in relation to the issue of bonds, the verification and registration of the Offering
Memorandum, accordingly, it should not be used by third parties or for any other purpose without our prior
written consent.

We will not accept any responsibility from any third parties different to the addressees of this report.

### EMPARK Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A. and Subsidiaries.

 Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the six months ended on 30 June 2017

**1 Group activities and consolidation scope**

**_1.1 Companies forming the Group and their business_**
The EMPARK Group, hereinafter the Group, comprises the dominant company Empark
Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A., and its subsidiaries, joint businesses and associate companies. The
registered address is: Avenida del General Perón 36, Madrid, Spain.

Through these companies, the Group engages in the following lines of business, which are its
primary reporting segments in accordance with IFRS 8.

The main business of Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A. formerly Cintra Aparcamientos, S.A.
and prior to that Ferrovial Aparcamientos, S.A. and previously Ferrevisa, S.A., is the construction and
operation of car parks under public authority concession arrangements. Said concessions stipulate
that, to fulfil the concession time frames, the car parks shall be returned to the granting entity in
perfect conditions of use, without any payment for provision of service for the Group. The
Subsidiaries carry out the same activity as the Controlling Company.

Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A., is the Controlling Company of a group of 46 subsidiaries, 6
associated and 6 JVs.

For the purpose of drawing up the interim condensed consolidated financial statements, the
assumption is that a group exists if the dominant company has one or more dependent organisations,
over which the dominant company exerts control either directly or indirectly.

Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A., the dominant company of the Group, was incorporated in
Madrid on 29 July 1986 as a public limited company. It is registered with the Company Register of
Madrid, on sheet M-53866, page 86, volume 14,090, and section 8 of the Companies Book. The most
recent adaptation and revision of its by-laws, based on the Company Register of Madrid, is registered
in volume 21,897, book 0 of section 8, page 222, sheet M-53866, and inscription no. 113.

All of the Group’s subsidiaries have the financial and tax year coinciding with the natural calendar
year and none of these are listed on the Stock Market. The scope of Consolidation is the following:

**_1.2 Changes in the scope_**

**30/06/2017**

-    The main changes in the scope of consolidation during financial 2017 have been the following:

On 1 February, the company Empark Infraestructuras, S.A.U., acquired 100% of the company
Construcciones Calle Menacho, S.L.

On 16 February the company Dornier S.A.U., constitutes the Ute Hosteleon – Dornier in which it
holds 66.66% of the shares.

On 23 March, the company Dornier, S.A.U., constitutes the company Dornier France, S.A.S. in which
it holds 80% of the shares.

In 2017 Empark II – Gestão e Exploração de Estacionamentos, S.A. acquired 100% of the company
Sient – Sistemas de Engenharia de Transito, S.A.

**2 Summary of the main accounting principles**

**_2.1 Reporting rules_**
The attached Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of Empark Aparcamientos y
Servicios, S.A. and its Subsidiaries for the six months ended on 30 June 2017 have been drawn up in
accordance with IAS 34, “Interim Financial Reporting”.

In accordance with the provisions of IAS 34, interim financial reporting is drawn up for the sole
purpose of updating the content of the latest consolidated financial statements prepared by the
Group, with emphasis on new activities, events and circumstances that occurred during the half year
without duplicating information previously published in the 2016 consolidated annual financial
statements. Therefore, for a proper understanding of the information included in these interim
condensed consolidated financial statements, they must be read in conjunction with the Group’s
consolidated annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2016 which were prepared
in accordance the applicable International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).

The Group applied the IFRS-EU for the first time in financial 2009 for drafting the consolidated
financial statements.

Unless otherwise indicated, the interim condensed consolidated financial statements are reported in
euros and all amounts are rounded up to thousands of euros.

**_2.2 Accounting rules applied_**

_a) Rules and interpretations adopted by the European Union applicable in this period._
The accounting criteria employed to draw up these interim condensed consolidated financial
statements for the six months ended 30 June 2017 are identical to those applied to the recent
consolidated financial statements drawn up by the Group for financial 2016 since no new rule,
interpretation of amendment applicable for the first time during this period has had an impact on the
Group’s accounting.

At the date of preparation of these Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements the Group
has applied all the applicable IFRS and interpretations approved by the European Union (EU-IFRS)
and applicable to fiscal years beginning on or after 1 January 2017.

_b) Rules and interpretations issued by the IASB and adopted by the European Union but not applicable_
_in this period_
The Group intends to adopt any standards, interpretations and amendments issued by the IASB the
application of which is not mandatory in the European Union at the date on which these interim
condensed consolidated financial statements were drawn up, if applicable to the Group when they
come into force. The Group is currently analysing their impact. Based on the analysis carried out to
date, the Group believes that their application will not have a significant impact on its interim
condensed consolidated financial statements.


-----

_IFRS 9 Financial instruments_
In July 2014 the IASB published the final version of IFRS 9, Financial Instruments, that contains all
phases of the financial instruments project and replaces IAS 39, Financial Instruments: valuation and
classification, and all previous versions of IFRS 9. The standard introduces new requirements for the
classification and valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities, the definition of impairment and
hedge accounting. IFRS 9 indicates that it is applicable for fiscal years beginning on or after 1
January 2018 although earlier application is permitted. Retrospective application is required, but no
change to the comparative information is required. Adoption of IFRS 9 will affect the classification and
valuation of financial assets of the Group but will have no impact on the classification and valuation of
its financial liabilities. Nor will the new method of calculating impairment affect the Group. There will
be substantial changes with respect to hedge accounting, since financial hedges in effect on the
transition date of IFRS 9, which currently cannot be recognised as accounting hedges in accordance
with IAS 39, may now be recorded as accounting hedges in accordance with the new regulations.

_IFRS 15 – Income from ordinary activities deriving from contracts with clients_
IFRS 15 was published in May 2014 and establishes a new five-step model that applies to revenue
from customer contracts. According to IFRS 15 revenue is recognised for an amount that reflects the
consideration that a company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for transferring goods or
services to a customer. The principles of IFRS 15 represents a more structured approach to valuing
and recognising income.

This new standard will repeal all previous rules regarding recognition of income. Full retroactive or
partial retroactive application is required for years beginning on or after 1 January 2018, allowing
early application. The Group is currently evaluating the impact of IFRS 15 and planning adoption by
the date indicated.

**_2.4 Comparison of information_**
Comparison of the interim condensed consolidated financial statements refers to the six-month
periods ended on 30 June 2017 and 2016 except the Condensed Consolidated Financial Position
Statements and the Statement of Changes in Net Equity, that compare 30 June 2017 with
31 December 2016.

**_2.5 Negative working capital and going concern_**
The Group had a positive working capital as of 30 June 2017 of 14,712 thousand euros and
9,648 thousand euros as of 31 December 2016. The Group also operates a centralised or
cashpooling treasury system by which Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A. manages the cash
requirements at Group level.

Moreover, the Group has credit lines and other financial resources available to meet cash
requirements (note 15).

Therefore, the Board considers that preparation of these interim condensed consolidated financial
statements based on the going concern principle, which involves the realization of assets and
liquidation of liabilities to the amounts and according to the classification with which they are recorded
in the interim condensed consolidated financial statements is appropriate.


-----

**_2.6 Accounting estimates and judgments_**
The information contained in these interim condensed consolidated financial statements is the
responsibility of the Group’s directors. The Group’s directors have made certain estimates to value
some of the assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and commitments recorded in the interim
condensed consolidated financial statements for the six months ended 30 June 2017.

Basically, these estimates refer to:

- Evaluation of potential losses due to the impairment of certain non-financial assets.

- Recovery of assets through deferred tax.

- Provisions for major repairs, replacements and fees.

- Evaluation of possible contingencies due to legal and tax risks.

_Assessment of possible impairment losses on certain non-financial assets_
The valuation of non-current assets other than financial assets requires the use of estimates to
determine their fair value for the purpose of evaluating any potential deterioration, especially for
goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life. In order to establish this fair value, the
Company Directors estimate the future cash flows expected from the assets or the cash generating
units to which they belong and apply an appropriate discount rate in order to calculate the current
value of those cash flows. Future cash flows depend on whether budgets for the following five
financial years are met, whereas discount rates depend on interest rates and the risk premium
associated with each cash generation unit. Note 6 provides details of hypotheses used to calculate
the value in use of cash generation units, including goodwill.

_Recover of assets through deferred taxes_
Deferred tax assets are recorded for all temporary deductible differences, negative tax bases pending
compensation and deductions pending application for which it is probable that the Company will have
future taxable earnings allowing these assets to be applied. The Directors have to make significant
estimates to establish the sum of deferred tax assets which may be registered, considering the
amounts and dates on which future tax earnings will be obtained and the reversal period of temporary
taxable differences.

_Provisions for major repairs, replacements and fees_
The Group has recognised provisions amounting to 52,758 thousand euros (50,757 thousand euros
as of 31 December 2016) in non-current and current liabilities in the interim condensed consolidated
financial statements. Making assumptions and estimates regarding the discount rate and the
expected costs to be incurred is an essential part of determining the value of these provisions.

These estimates were made based on the best information available as of 30 June 2017 and
31 December 2016 on the events analysed. However, it is possible that events that may occur in the
future will require modification of these estimates, which would be carried out as required in
accordance with IAS 8.

_Evaluation of possible contingencies due to legal and fiscal risks_
The Group recognizes provisions for risks by making judgments and estimates in relation to the
probability of occurrence of said risks, as well as to determine the amount of such risks, recording the
corresponding provision when the risk is considered probable (probability greater than 50%).

**_2.7 Resource management policies_**
The Group manages its investments after a thorough review and evaluation of potentially attractive
projects from the environmental, social security and labour-related, commercial, financial and
economic points of view with the aim of achieving sustainable and balanced growth.

The Group’s shareholders seek the desired balance between the expected return on investments and
the acceptable risk when carrying out these activities.


-----

**_2.8 Consolidation policies_**
The Group closed the balance sheets of the individual financial statements of all companies included
in the scope of consolidation at the same date on 30 June 2017. Accounting homogenisation criteria
based on the accounting principles of the Controlling Company have been applied in order to ensure
homogeneous reporting of the items that comprise these interim condensed consolidated financial
statements. The interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been drawn up on the
basis of application of the following methods:

**a. Full consolidation method: All companies considered subsidiaries are fully consolidated. For**
these purposes subsidiaries are defined as companies in which Empark Aparcamientos y
Servicios, S.A. has effective control because it possesses more than 50% of voting rights directly
or indirectly by agreements with other shareholders. In assessing whether the Group controls
another organisation, consideration is given to the existence and impact of potential voting rights
which can currently be exercised or converted. Inclusion in the scope of consolidation of the Group
is carried out from the moment effective control of the subsidiary is formally established. The value
of the holdings of minority shareholders in the equity and the result of the financial year of the fully
consolidated subsidiaries is reported in the “Minority Shareholders” section of the Consolidated
Statement of Financial Position and “Result attributable to Minorities” section of the Overall
Consolidated Result Statement.

**b. Consolidation by the equity method: Associated companies are consolidated by the equity**
method. For these purposes, subsidiaries are defined as all those companies in which the group
has significant influence over management but does not exercise control or joint management with
third parties. Application of the equity method recognises the percentage of participation in the
equity of the company both in its net worth and the result of the financial year.

**c. Proportional integration method: Applies to joint ventures, which are those in which**
contractually, the management of subsidiaries is carried out jointly by the parent company and by
third parties not related with the group. The assets and liabilities assigned to joint operations or
those controlled jointly with other participants are reported in the interim condensed consolidated
financial statements classified according to their specific nature in the existing percentage holding.
The income and expenditure of consortiums are also reported according to their nature and to the
percentage holding.

**d. Balances and transactions with Group companies: Balances and transactions between Group**
companies are eliminated in the consolidation process.

**e. Conversion of financial statements in currencies other than the euro: The financial**
statements of subsidiaries and consortiums whose accounting records are in currencies other than
the euro included in the consolidation are converted at the closing exchange rate of all its assets
and liabilities with the exception of equity, which is valued the exchange rate at the time they joined
the Group. Within the consolidation process, the shares held in companies of the group are
eliminated against the shareholder equity, except in the associated companies, which are
converted at the exchange rate at closing.

The results are converted at the average exchange rate for the financial year. The difference arising
during the conversion process described above is recorded as “Conversion differences” under the
head of Net equity.

_a) Subsidiaries_
The acquisition cost method is used when accounting for the acquisition of subsidiaries. The
acquisition cost is the fair value of the assets received, equity instruments issued and liabilities
incurred or assumed at the conversion date and the fair value of any additional consideration that
depends on future events (provided it is probable and can be reliably measured).

If control is acquired in stages, the goodwill (or the negative consolidation difference) is established
for each of the individual transactions as the difference between the fair value of the holding and the
net sum attributable to the holding out of the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities
undertaken which are in place on that date. The identifiable assets and liabilities assumed are
consolidated on the basis of existing fair value at the time of acquisition of control, recognised under
the head of Minority Interests for the amount resulting from its participation in equity.


-----

The difference between the net sum attributable from the fair value of the assets and liabilities
acquired and in place on the date of acquisition of control and the corresponding sum on each of the
dates when the holdings were acquired gives rise to an adjustment in the reserves of the Group,
recorded net of the tax burden.

_b) Associated companies_
When the equity method procedure is first applied, investments in associated companies are valued
at the sum corresponding to the percentage represented by the holding at the time of the investment,
based on the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities undertaken. If the resulting difference
between the cost of the stake and this value is positive, this is included in the book value of the
investment. If it is negative, the difference is recognised directly in the Condensed Consolidated
Result Statement.

Any variations experienced during the financial year in progress in the net equity of the Group
included in the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements under the equity method,
following elimination of the proportion based on results generated in transactions between that
company and the company holding the stake, or any other group company, and not involving third
parties, increase or reduce, as applicable, the book value of the holding in question to the
corresponding proportion, following consideration of any amortisations and impairments occurring
since the method was applied for the first time.

Profits distributed by associated companies reduce the carrying value of the investment. The
harmonisation of valuation criteria and reporting periods is applied to associated investments in the
same way as for subsidiaries.

_c) Joint Ventures_
Non-realised results deriving from reciprocal transactions are eliminated in proportion to the holding,
in addition to the amounts of reciprocal assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and cash flows.

**_2.9 Main policies applied to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements._**
The accounting policies used in the preparation of the Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial
Statements for the six months ended 30 June 2017 are the same as those applied in the last
consolidated annual financial statements of the 2016 financial year made by the Controlling
Company.

_2.9.1 Intangible assets_
Intangible fixed assets are initially valued at cost, either the acquisition price or production cost. The
cost of intangible fixed assets acquired by means of the combination of businesses is stated as the
fair value on the date of acquisition.

Following initial recognition, the intangible fixed assets are valued at their cost, less the cumulative
amortisation and, where applicable, the cumulative sum of recorded impairment corrections.

a) Concessions
Concessions mainly includes the fees paid on certain concessions for the operation of car parks.

These public authority concessions are recognised as assets at cost minus the cumulative
amortisation and the cumulative amount of recognised valuation corrections for impairment.

Concessions also include access rights paid by means of a concession fee during the period of the
concession. In this case the concessions are included under assets at the current value of the
minimum agreed payments without taking contingent payments into consideration.

The concessions are amortised on a linear basis over the period of the concession.

b) I.T. applications
Software licenses acquired from third parties are capitalized on the basis of the costs incurred to
acquire and prepare the specific software for use.


-----

The Company amortises its I.T. applications on a linear basis, distributing the cost of the assets over
the estimated useful life of the same, which is three years.

The costs connected with the development or maintenance of computer programs are recognised as
an expense when they are incurred. The costs directly connected with the production of individual,
identifiable computer programs produced by the Group, provided that it is considered probable that
they will generate economic benefits greater than the costs for more than one year, are recognised
as intangible fixed assets. Direct costs include the cost of the personnel developing the computer
programs and an appropriate percentage of general costs.

_2.9.2 Property, plant and equipment_
Tangible fixed assets are recognised at their acquisition cost with the addition of the costs incurred up
until their operational start-up, minus cumulative amortisation and the cumulative amount of
recognised losses.

The costs of the extension, modernisation or improvement of tangible fixed assets are charged to the
asset as an increase in its value provided they represent an increase in its capacity, productivity or an
extension to its useful life, and wherever it is possible to calculate or estimate the book value of the
items cancelled from the inventory due to replacement.

Retirements or disposals are reflected in the accounts by eliminating the cost thereof and the
corresponding accrued amortisation.

The costs of major repairs are recorded as assets and amortised over the course of their estimated
useful life, while recurrent maintenance expenses are debited to the income statements during the
financial year in which they occur.

The amortisation of tangible fixed assets, except for land, which is not amortised, is calculated in
accordance with the values of the updated cost, following the linear method based on the estimated
useful life, in accordance with the depreciation actually suffered through operation, usage and
enjoyment. The following are the estimated useful lives:

**Estimated useful life**

Buildings and other constructions.......................................................................................................  50
Machinery, installations and tools.......................................................................................................  10
Furniture and fittings...........................................................................................................................  10
Vehicles...............................................................................................................................................   6
Other fixed assets...............................................................................................................................   3

When the book value of an asset is greater than its estimated recoverable value, its value is restated
immediately at the recoverable amount.

The income and expenditure from sale of tangible fixed assets are calculated by comparing the
amount obtained by the sale with the book value and are recorded in the income statement under the
head of “Impairment and result due to disposal of fixed assets”.

The residual value and useful life of assets are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each
financial statement date.

The need to perform valuation corrections based on impairment in value is analysed at least at the
close of the financial year.

_2.9.3 Impairment losses_
In the case of goodwill, the Group carries out annual value impairment tests. In the case of
depreciable assets, at each accounting closure the Group assesses the existence of any loss in value
that forces it to reduce the carrying amount. If there is any indication of impairment the recoverable
value of the asset is calculated in order to identify the scope of the loss by impairment in case its
recoverable value is lower than its book value, and its effect is recorded in the income statement.
Impairment losses must be assessed for each individual asset. If this is not possible, the impairment


-----

loss is determined for the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash flows independent
of flows from other assets (cash-generating units).

The recoverable amount is the market value (arm’s length value less associated costs) or the value in
use, whichever is higher. The value in use is calculated from estimated future cash flows, discounted
at a rate that reflects the present market value, taking into account the value of money and specific
risks associated with the asset.

_2.9.4 Interest costs_
Financial expenses directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of fixed assets requiring a
period of time longer than one year in order to be fit for use are included in the cost until such time as
the asset is in operational condition.

_2.9.5 Financial assets_

a) Loans and accounts receivable:

Loans and accounts receivable are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or fixable collections and
are not listed on an active market. They are included under current assets, except those with a
maturity date beyond twelve months from the date of the consolidated financial statement, which are
classified as non-current assets. Loans and receivables are included in “Loans to companies” and
“Trade and other receivables” in the consolidated statement of financial position.

These financial assets are valued initially at fair value and then at amortised cost using the effective
interest rate. Transaction costs directly attributable to their acquisition are recognised in the
consolidated income statement. Quarterly value adjustments for impairment are made if there is
evidence that all amounts owed are not collected. The amount of the value impairment loss is the
difference between the book value of the asset and the value of the estimated future cash flows,
discounted at the effective rate of interest at the time of initial recognition. Any applicable valuation
corrections and reversion are recorded in the consolidated income statement.

The recognition and reversion of valuation corrections through the impairment of client accounts
receivable have been included under “Losses, impairment and variation in provisions through trade
operations” in the consolidated income statement.

The sums charged to the impairment account are normally cancelled once there is no expectation of
more cash being recovered.

The maximum exposure to credit risk on the date of submission of the information is the fair value of
each of the aforementioned categories of accounts receivable. The Company does not hold any
guaranty as insurance.

b) Investments in the equity of associated companies:

They are valued at their cost minus the cumulative value of value impairment corrections as required.
However, where there is an investment made prior to the classification of a company as an
associated company, the cost of the investment is assumed to be its book value prior to such
classification. Previous value adjustments recognised directly in equity are held in the same until they
are deregistered.

Investments in the assets of associated companies are included in the accounting records under both
current and non-current assets.

The current assets include short-term investment in associated companies comprising corporate
loans and other financial assets.

Non-current assets recognise the balance of long-term investments comprised of asset instruments in
associated companies. Asset instruments are broken down in the balances of holdings in associated
companies and share disbursements pending and not called.

If there is objective evidence that the book value is not recoverable, the appropriate value
adjustments arising from the difference between the book value and the recoverable amount are


-----

made, understood as its fair value minus sales costs or the current value of the cash flows deriving
from the investment, whichever is greater.

_2.9.6 Financial derivatives at fair value_
Derivatives are initially recognised at market value on the contracting date. Subsequent changes in
the market value are also recognised at each reporting date of the financial statements. The method
of identifying the profit and losses will depend on whether the instrument is classified as hedging or
not and if so, on the type of hedging. The following are the types of hedging designated by the
Group:

a) Cash flow hedging: Its purpose is to hedge the exposure to highly probable future transactions and
variations in cash flow. The gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recorded by the non-efficient
section of the consolidated result statement while the efficient part is identified directly under net
equity of the consolidated financial position statement. The amount deferred in net equity is not
recognised in the consolidated result statement until the gains or losses of hedged transactions are
recognised in result or until the maturity date of the transactions. This recognition is carried out the
same way as the results of the hedged item.

In the case of derivatives that do not qualify as hedge items, the loss or gain of said instrument are
recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Income Statement.

_2.9.7 Business combinations and goodwill_
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition cost method which entails recognising
the fair value of the assets and liabilities identified in the acquired business. The difference between
the cost of the business combination and the value of the identifiable assets acquired minus liabilities
assumed is recognised as goodwill, if positive, or as income in the income statement if negative. In
the acquisitions of subsidiaries, the goodwill generated is considered as increased value of the
holding. Consolidation goodwill is not amortised. Instead, the cash-generating units to which the
goodwill is assigned on the acquisition date are subject, at least annually, to review of their potential
impairment and on recognition of the associated value adjustment for impairment, if any (note 6).

Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units (CGU) with the aim of testing losses through
impairment. The allocation is made to those CGUs that are expected to benefit from the business
combination in which the goodwill arose.

_2.9.8 Inventory_
Inventories are valued at cost or their net realizable value, whichever is lower. The cost of inventories
is determined using the weighted average cost method.

The cost of finished products and products in progress, which corresponds to developments in
progress and those completed, includes costs incurred in the construction of car parks intended for
assignment of usage.

Parking spaces held for sale and included in inventories are valued at the acquisition price or
production cost.

The appropriate value restatements are made when the cost exceeds the market value and are
recognised as an expense in the income statement. If the circumstances that caused the restatement
cease to exist, the amount of the same is reverted and recognised as income in the income
statement.

_2.9.9 Cash and cash equivalents_
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits in banks and other short-term highly liquid
investments with a maturity not exceeding three months at the time of acquisition, which are not
subject to significant value change risks, are convertible into cash and which are part of the normal
treasury management policy of the Group.

This section includes the head of short term restricted cash flow. This concept collects the
investments of the same nature and maturity affected by financing of specific infrastructure projects,
whose availability is restricted by financing contracts as guarantee to cover specific short term


-----

obligations relative to payment of interests or principle of the debt as well as for the future
maintenance of the infrastructure.

_2.9.10 Net equity_
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new
shares are recognised in equity as a deduction, net of taxes. Acquisitions of controlling group treasury
stock for the consideration paid including attributable related costs are deducted from equity. When
these shares are sold or subsequently reissued, any amount received net of costs is included in net
equity.

The basic earnings per share is calculated as the ratio between the net profits attributed to the
controlling company and the average weighted number of ordinary shares in circulation during said
period. The diluted earnings per share is calculated as the ratio between net income for the period
attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares in
circulation during the period, since there are no equity instruments issued that may be converted into
controlling company shares.

_2.9.11 Transactions between related parties_
In general, operations among tied parties are accounted for at the initial point at their fair value. In
any case, if the agreed price differs from the fair value, the difference is recorded in accordance with
the economic reality of the operation. The subsequent valuation is made in accordance with the terms
set forth in the applicable regulations.

_2.9.12 Provisions and contingent liabilities_
Provisions for contingencies and expenses are accounted for in accordance with the estimated
amount required to deal with probable or certain responsibilities arising from legal proceedings in
progress and for compensation and pending obligations of an undetermined amount, guarantees or
other similar sureties.

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation, either legal or implicit, as a
result of past events and it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the
obligation and the amount can be estimated reliably.

Provisions are valued at the current value of the disbursements which are expected to be required in
order to settle the obligation, using a pre-tax rate which reflects the opinions of the current market as
to the current value of money and the specific risks of the obligation. Adjustments in the provision
based on any updates are recognised as a financial expense as they accrue.

Provisions maturing within one year or less and with an insignificant financial impact are not
discounted.

Contingent liabilities are possible obligations arising as a result of past events, the materialisation of
which depends on whether or not one or more future events should occur, outside the control of the
Group.

Given the activities in which the Group is currently engaged it has no liabilities, expenses, assets or
provisions and contingencies of an environmental nature which could prove significant with reference
to its equity, its financial situation and its results. Hence, specific breakdowns are not included in the
report herein on the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements with regards information
on environmental issues.

Costs derived from the protection and improvements of the environment are attributed to the
consolidated results for the financial year in which they are incurred, irrespective of the point when
the monetary or financial flow derived from them occurs.

When such expenses involve the acquisition of property, plant and equipment the purpose of which is
to minimise environmental impact and to protect and improve the environment, these are included in
the accounts as an increase in the value of fixed assets.


-----

_2.9.13 Financial liabilities_

Debts and accounts payable

These liabilities are initially carried at the fair net value of the expenses incurred in the transaction,
subsequently recording these by their amortised cost according to the effective interest method. The
effective interest rate is the discount rate equal to the expected flow of future payments foreseeable
up until maturity of the liability. In the event that the effective interest rate is initially considered
different from the market interest, the liability is valued taking into account the actual value of the
future flows at that market rate in the case of loans with set interest rates. If said interest rate is not
fulfilled, the valuation of these is also carried out at the aforementioned market interest rate.

In the event of a renegotiation of existing debts, it is considered that no substantial modification has
occurred to the financial liability if the lender of the new loan is the same as that which granted the
initial loan and the current value of the cash flows, including the associated issuance and execution
costs using the effective interest method, varies by no more than 10% from the current value of the
cash flows pending payment on the original liability, calculated in accordance with this same method.

_2.9.14 Corporate income tax and deferred taxes_
The Group has since 1 January 2005 paid taxes under the consolidated taxation system at Cintra
Concesiones de Infraestructuras de Transporte, S.A., as a result of the change in ownership which
occurred in 2004, following which the Dominant Company fell within the aforementioned tax
consolidation perimeter. The group previously paid taxes under the consolidated taxation system as
part of the Ferrovial, S.A. Group. During 2009, as a result of the sale transaction referred, the Group
left the aforementioned tax system, and on 31 December 2009 the company applied to pay taxes as
a tax group, with effect from 1 January 2010. This group comprises the following companies:

- Empark, Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A.

- Dornier, S.A.U.

- Femet, S.A.

- Guadianapark, S.A.

- Balsol 2001, S.A.

- Empark Infraestructuras, S.A.

- Empark Aparcamientos Andalucía, S.L.

- Maksu España, S.L.

- Car Parking, S.L.U.

- I Mas D Parking, S.L.U.

- Eospark Gestora de Participaciones, S.A.

Corporate tax expense (income) is the amount that accrues on this account in the fiscal year and
includes both the expense (income) for current tax and deferred tax.

Both the expense (income) derived from current and from deferred taxes are recorded in the
consolidated income statement. However, the taxation effect connected with items directly recorded in
the consolidated net worth statement is recognised in the net worth.

Assets or liabilities based on current tax are valued for the sums expected to be paid to or recovered
from the tax authorities, employing the regulations in force or approved and pending publication at the
date of close of the financial year.

Deferred taxes are calculated in accordance with the liability method, based on the temporary
differences arising between the taxable base sums of the assets and their book values. However,
they are not recognised when deferred taxes are the result of the initial recognition of an asset or a
liability in a transaction other than a combination of businesses which, at the time of the transaction,


-----

does not affect either the book result or the calculation base for the tax. Deferred tax is established
by applying the regulations and taxation rates approved or about to be approved at the Financial
Statement date and which are expected to be applied when the corresponding asset through deferred
tax is realised or the deferred tax liability settled.

Assets through deferred taxes are recognised to the extent that it is considered probable that future
taxable profits will be made which could be used to compensate for temporary differences.

Deferred taxes on temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries, associates and
consortiums are recognised, except in cases where the Group can control the timing of reversion of
temporary differences and it is probable that they will not revert in foreseeable future.

The term consolidated corporate tax includes all domestic and foreign taxes related to profits subject
to tax. Consolidated corporate tax also includes other taxes such as taxes on repatriated profits and
any other levy taken as the basis for calculating the accounting result.

The corporate tax expense reflected in the consolidated financial statements is calculated by
aggregating the expense registered for each company that belongs to the consolidated group,
increased or decreased, as appropriate, by elimination of accounting consolidation adjustments and
by the differences arising between the taxable base sums of the assets and liabilities and their book
values.

Deferred taxes are not recognised when the transaction has no effect on the book and/or fiscal value
of the assets or liabilities involved. In the case of business combinations, the corresponding deferred
taxes derived from the price assigning process and the fiscal amortisation of the generated goodwill
in each case is registered.

The assets and liabilities through deferred taxes are calculated at current taxation rates. At the date
of the Condensed Consolidated Income Statement and which are foreseen to be applicable during
the period in which the asset is realised or the liability is settled. They are debited or credited to the
income statement except when they refer to items that are directly recorded as equity, in which case
they are accounted for as debit or credit to said accounts. There is no liability by deferred taxes for
non-distributed profit of subsidiaries when the Group can control the reversion of the temporary
differences and it is not probable that these will be reverted in a foreseeable future. Deferred tax
assets and tax credits derived from negative tax bases are recognised when it is probable that the
Group may recover these in the future regardless of the time in which they are recovered and always
when the recovery is prior to the legal reversion period.

Assets and deferred tax liabilities are not discounted and are classified as a non-current asset
(liability) in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. The deferred taxes are
reviewed at each accounting closure.

_2.9.15 Conversion of foreign currency transactions_
The Financial Statements of the companies denominated in foreign currencies are converted using
the closure exchange rate method according to the following rates:

**30/06/2017     30/06/2017     30/06/2016     31/12/2016**
**(not audited)   (not audited)   (not audited)       (audited)**

**Exchange rate                              average          close        average          close**

**euro/pound sterling ..................................    0.8599       0.8793       0.7905       0.8562**
**euro/Turkish lira** ........................................    3.6792       4.0134       3.2737       3.7072

_2.9.16 Recognition of revenue_
Revenue and expenses are attributed in accordance with the accrual principle, in other words based
on when the true value of the goods and services they represent becomes current, regardless of
when the monetary or financial value arising from them is realised.

Revenue is recorded at the fair value of the consideration to be received and represents the sums
receivable for goods delivered and services provided within the ordinary course of the Group’s
activities minus returns, rebates, discounts and VAT.


-----

The Group recognises revenue when the amount thereof can reliably be valued, it is probable that
future economic benefits will be received by the Group and specific conditions are met for each of the
activities, as detailed below. The amount of the revenue cannot be reliably assessed until all
contingencies connected with the sale have been resolved. The Group bases its estimates on
historical results, taking into account the type of customer, type of transaction and the specific terms
of each agreement.

**a) It is worth making the following distinctions within the car park business:**

a.1) Off-street and mixed parking

a.2) On-street parking (ORA)

a.3) Resident parking

a.1) Off-street and mixed parking

Off-street car park revenues are entered when the hourly parking rate is paid and, in the case of
season ticket-holders, on an accrual basis. Mixed car parks (with public and private spaces) record
revenues as follows: in the case of public spaces, in the manner described in the preceding
paragraph; and in case of private spaces, the amount received is recorded in the income statement
at the time of the transfer of concession usage of the corresponding parking spaces.

The cost of residential spaces is recognised in inventories and are transcribed to the income
statement on the date of the transfer of the concession of usage.

a.2) On-street parking (ORA)

Revenue from the ORA parking meter service is mainly based on the amount of the cost of providing
the service plus a percentage, generally between 1% and 3%, of the excess between said cost and
the funds collected. In some ORA contracts the revenue is earned at a fixed rate (service cost)
regardless of the funds collected, which are paid to the Town Council. It is recognised in the accounts
at the time the service is provided.

a.3) Resident parking

This business involves the construction of car parks whose spaces are sold directly to the end
customer during the time frame of the concession. The sales and costs are not recorded until the
parking space is delivered, which tends to coincide with the signature of the contract or, exceptionally,
with the public deed of sale.

_2.9.17 Leases_

a) When one of the Group’s companies is the lessee – Financial leasing

The Group leases certain tangible fixed assets. Leases of tangible fixed assets where the Group
substantially retains the risks and benefits derived from ownership are classified as financial leases.
Financial leases are capitalised at the commencement of the lease at the fair value of the property
leased, or the current value of the minimum payments agreed under the lease, whichever is lower.
The calculation of current value is based on the implicit interest rate of the contract, and if this cannot
be established, the Group interest rate for similar operations.

Each lease payment is distributed between the liability and financial charges. The total financial
charge is distributed over the course of the lease and attributed to the consolidated income statement
of the financial year when it accrues, applying the effective interest rate method. Contingent
payments are recorded as a cost for the financial year when incurred. The corresponding lease
obligations, net of finance charges, are included in “Financial lease payables”. Fixed assets acquired
under a financial lease system depreciate during their useful life or the duration of the contract,
whichever is lower.


-----

b) When one of the Group’s companies is the lessee – Operational leasing

Leases where the lessor retains a significant art of the risks and benefits of ownership are classified
as operating leases. Payments under operating leases (net of any incentive received from the lessor)
are charged to the consolidated result statement of the financial year when they accrue on a linear
basis over the period of the lease.

c) When the Group is the lessor

Where assets are the leased under a financial lease arrangement, the current value of lease
payments, discounted at the implicit interest rate of the contract, is recognised as an account
receivable. The difference between the gross amount to be received and the current value of this sum
for interest not accrued is attributed to the Consolidated Statement of profit or loss of the financial
year when said interest accrues, in accordance with the effective interest rate method.

Where assets are leased under an operating lease arrangement, the asset is included in the
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position in accordance with its nature. Revenue derived from the
lease is recognised in a linear manner over the course of the lease period.

_2.9.18 Redundancy compensation_
In accordance with current legislation, the Company is obliged to pay compensation to employees
who, under certain circumstances, have their employment contracts terminated. Redundancy
compensation payments which can be reasonably quantified are entered as an expense in the
financial year in which a valid expectation created by the Company exists with respect to the third
parties affected.

**_2.10 Seasonality of operations_**
The net amounts of the turnover and profit of the Group are not significantly influenced by seasonality
of operations.

**3 Management of financial and capital risks**
The Group’s activities are exposed to various financial risks: market risk (including exchange rate
risk, interest rate risk and price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.

Risk management is controlled by the Senior Economic and Financial Management of Amsterdam,
which identifies, evaluates and pages financial risks in accordance with the policies approved by the
Board of Directors. The Board provides policies for overall risk management and for specific areas
such as exchange rate risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, use of derivative and non-derivative
instruments and the investment of surplus liquidity.

The financial risks to which the Group is exposed include those derived from the guarantees and
bonds required in order to undertake its activities.

During fiscal 2016 and the six months ended 30 June 2017, the Group has placed bank guarantees
with third parties and guarantee commitments to other Group companies in order to engage in its
business.

**_3.1 Market risk: Exchange rate risk_**
Management has established an exchange rate risk management policy for foreign currencies other
than the operating currency. Forward contracts, negotiated by the finance department, are used to
manage exchange rate risks arising from future trade transactions and recognised assets and
liabilities. Exchange rate risk arises where future commercial transactions or recognised assets or
liabilities are quoted in a currency other than the organisation’s operating currency.

The directors consider that this risk will not have significant impact on the interim condensed
consolidated financial statements.


-----

**_3.2 Market risk: Interest rate risk from cash flows and fair value_**
As of 30 June 2017, if the interest rates on outside resources quoted in euros had been 50 basis
points higher/lower with all other variables remaining constant, the result after taxes for the period
would have been (1,115)/1,115 thousand euros lower/higher, mainly as a result of an
increase/decrease in the cost of interest on variable-rate loans.

The Group carries out the appropriate interest rate hedges by contracting an IRS (Interest Rate
Swap). (note 14).

As of 30 June 2017 6.71% of the total financial debt balance was covered by these financial hedging
instruments.

The directors consider that this risk will not have significant impact on the interim condensed
consolidated financial statements.

**_3.3 Credit risk_**
Credit risk is handled by groups. Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, financial
derivative instruments and deposits held in banks and financial institutions, along with wholesale and
retail clients including pending accounts receivable and committed transactions. With respect to
banks and financial institutions, only financial institutions that are known to be reputable and solvent
are accepted.

The directors consider that this risk will not have significant impact on the interim condensed
consolidated financial statements.

**_3.4 Liquidity risk_**
Prudent management of liquidity risk involves holding sufficient cash and transferable securities,
having access to finance through a sufficient number of agreed credit facilities and having the
capacity to unwind market positions. Given the dynamic type data from underlying businesses, the
object of the Group’s Treasury Department is to maintain the flexibility in financing by the availability
of lines of credit.

The directors consider that this risk will not have significant impact on the interim condensed
consolidated financial statements.

Fundamentally, concessions include the cost of construction or acquisition of operating rights of
different establishments, as well as initial fees paid for certain car park operation concessions.

These public authority concessions are recognised as assets at cost minus the cumulative
amortisation and the cumulative amount of recognised valuation corrections for impairment.

Concessions also include access rights paid by means of a concession fee during the period of the
concession. In this case the concessions are included under assets at the current value of the
minimum agreed payments without taking contingent payments into consideration.

**During the first six months of 2017 the main changes in intangible assets were as follows:**

During the first six months of 2017 the additions in concessions was 12,158 thousand euros. The
main amounts are as follows:

Ute Hosteleon – Dornier registrations of 7,116 thousand euros for Complejo Hospitalario Ciudad de
León.

Dornier, S.A.U. registrations of 2,300 thousand euros mainly for ORA service in Valladolid
(1,830 thousand euros), ORA service in Xátiva (193 thousand euros) and ORA service in Almería

**148,188       147,576**

**_Impairment tests_**
The Group conducts an annual procedure to identify any possible deficit in the registered cost with
regard to the recoverable value of goodwill.

In the case of the goodwill of Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A., Dornier, SAU, Balsol 2001,
S.A., Car Parking, S.L.U. and Empark Portugal-Empreendimentos e Exploraçao de Parqueamentos,
S.A. this procedure is performed by analysing the assets – the individual parking facilities – available
to the companies at the time of purchase and which gave rise to the goodwill recognised.

The impairment is calculated by comparing the value of these assets with their fair value, the latter
understood as the value of the future cash flow discounts which it is estimated that the assets will
generate based on objective hypotheses, discounted at an estimated capital cost based on a risk-free


-----

rate using the 30-year bond as a benchmark and the level of risk of the asset, along with an
estimated market premium.

A residual value that incorporates renewal of the contract and growth is also calculated.

The following assumptions have been assumed to determine the present value of future cash flows
from investments:

It has been determined that the corresponding investment will generate cash flows with terms up to
maturity; this period is between 5 and 50 years, depending on the concession.

The associated revenue and expenditure forecasts were performed in accordance with the following
general criteria:

- In the case of revenue, in order to estimate price variations, consideration was given to the
estimated variation in the consumer price index (CPI) in each of the countries where the
investments are operational (2% in both Spain and Portugal), the appropriate price review formulae
as set forth in the concession contracts on the basis of the price variation indices and/or any
specific correction factors which may apply.

Ramp up during the first 2-5 years of the concession has been taken into account in the case of
new contracts, depending on the specific analysis of each contract; subsequently, an evolution in
revenue similar to previous revenue has been estimated.

- In terms of expenditure, the evolution thereof was calculated on the basis of the envisaged
evolution of corresponding CPI rates (2% in both Spain and Portugal), as well as on the planned
evolution of the activity.

- Consideration is also given to the cost of works to be performed in order to keep infrastructure in
perfect usage conditions, based on the best estimate available according to the company’s
experience, and taking into consideration the forecast evolution of the business.

- Consideration was given to the future costs and revenue associated with renewals of contracts and
also the investments required for these renewals on the basis of the investments occurring in
previous contracts.

Renewal rates used in different lines of business (off-street, ORA, management) have been
estimated between 75% and 85% based on actual rates obtained by the Group.

- The forecast cash flows obtained on the basis of the projected revenue and expenditure, in
accordance with the aforementioned criteria, were updated at the discount rate resulting from
adding to the long-term cost of money the risk premium assigned by the market to the country
where the Group performs its operations, the risk premium assigned by the market to each
business (both based on a long-term vision), along with the financial structure of the company or
cash-generating unit in question. The discount rate employed was 6.75%.

As a result of the impairment test it is evident that the cash-generating units to which the recognised
recorded goodwill is assigned enable recovery of the net value of each item recognised as of 30 June
2017 and 31 December 2016 and therefore there is no need to provide any provision for impairment.

Similarly, sensitivity analyses have been performed on reasonably possible changes to the main
valuation variables (CPI, inflation, discount rate, renewals) and the recoverable value remain above
the net accounting value.

**Total (note 14) ........................................................................................        4,509         5,260**

The Group contracts derivative financial instruments (interest rate swaps) with various parties, mainly
financial institutions with suitable investment grades, to protect itself from interest rate fluctuations in
its bank loans. These derivatives meet the conditions to be designated as accounting hedge
instruments (cash flow hedges), so any changes to their fair value are temporarily allocated to net
equity. Valuation techniques with observable market data have been used for their valuation. The
most frequently applied evaluation techniques include future price models, using calculations of the
current value of expected cash flows. The models incorporate different data, including credit rating
and interest rate curves. Change in credit risk have neither had a material effect on the efficacy of the
hedge not on the valuation of derivatives designated as such.

On 18 November 2011, Empark Aparcamientos Andalucía, S.L., took out a loan with La Caixa
amounting to 7,000 thousand euros. This loan is hedged with the same entity for 6,300 thousand
euros. As of 30 June 2017 the notional figure was 4,759 thousand euros. Empark Aparcamientos
Andalucía, S.L.U., pays a fixed rate of 2.83% for this swap.

As of 30 June 2017 Aparcamientos Guipuzcoanos, S.A. holds an interest rate derivative to manage
exposure to fluctuations in syndicated credit rates contracted at variable rates. This contract fixes a
range of interest payments and charges depending on the current market interest rate (Euribor).

As of 30 June 2017 Concha Parking, S.A. holds an interest rate derivative to manage exposure to
fluctuations of the rates of its bank loans arranged at variable rates. These contracts fix a range of
interest payments and charges depending on the current market interest rate (Euribor).

On 25 September 2008, Construcciones Calle Menacho, S.L, took out a loan with BBVA amounting to
1,700 thousand euros with start date on 30 September 2010. As of 30 June 2017 the notional figure
was 718 thousand euros. Empark Aparcamientos Andalucía, S.L.U., pays a fixed rate of 5.06% for
this swap.

The valuation of the derivatives held by the Group as of 30 June 2017 and 31 December 2016 is
(4,509) thousand euros and (5,260) thousand euros respectively. (See note 14).

The Group classifies valuations at fair value using a hierarchy that reflects the relevance of the
variables employed in the valuations as per the following levels:

a) non-adjusted quoted prices on active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1).

b) variables other than the quoted prices included in Level 1, which can be observed for the asset or
liability, either directly (that is, as prices), or indirectly (that is, derived from prices) (Level 2), and

c) variables, used for the asset or liability, that are not based on observable market date
(unobservable variables – Level 3).

The only Group assets or liabilities valued at fair value are these derivatives (interest swaps), found
in category b) of the previous breakdown (Level 2).

-----

The average Group workforce as of 30 June 2017 consists of 2,617 people of whom 30% are women
and 70% men.

As for the Company’s financial risk management policy, this is based on the Group managing its
capital in order to guarantee that it will be in a position to continue operating as a profitable business,
while maximising shareholder return by striking an optimum balance between debt and equity.

The following are the main risks to which the Group is exposed:

- Liquidity risk: Within the framework of its overall policy the Group determines cash requirements
using two tools: Treasury budget with a 12-month horizon with monthly detail and updates and
treasury budgets with a 30-day horizon with daily updates and details. These tools identify treasury
needs in volume and time and make plans for new financing needs.

- Credit risk: The Group maintains its cash and cash equivalents in financial institutions with high
credit ratings. It should furthermore be mentioned that there is no significant concentration of credit
risk with third parties.

- Interest rate risk: The interest rate risk of the Group arises basically from long-term borrowings.
The Group has contracted financial instruments that partially cover the risk of possible interest rate
hikes.

- Exchange rate risk: The Group has no significant exchange rate risk since the vast majority of its
assets and liabilities, income and expenses are denominated in euros.

**_Subsequent events_**
The following events have occurred after the date on which these financial statements were drawn
up:

On July 28, 2017 Macquarie European Infraestructure Fund 5 (MEIF5) agreed to acquire 100% of
Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios S.A.

The terms of the acquisition have not been disclosed. The acquisition is expected to be completed
before the end of the year, subject to the receipt of the usual competition authorizations and other
usual.

At the end of the transaction, the Senior Guaranteed Bonds of 6.75% due in 2019 and the Senior
Secure Floating Rate Bonds with maturity in 2019 of Empark Funding, S.A. are fully amortized in
accordance with the optional repayment provisions for the future.

**Investigation and development**
The Group has not carried out any research and development activities.

**Treasury stock**
There have been no acquisitions of own shares.

**Derivatives**
The Group has contracted financial instruments that partially cover the risk of possible interest rate
hikes of long-term outside resources.

**Environmental aspects**
Environmental activity is defined as any action intended to prevent, reduce or repair damage to the
environment.

The investments derived from environmental activities are valued at acquisition cost and are activated
as increased fixed asset expenses in the financial year in which they are incurred, following the
criteria described in note 2 regarding applicable accounting standards.


-----

Costs derived from the protection and improvement of the environment are attributed to the results for
the financial year in which they are incurred, irrespective of the point when the monetary or financial
flow derived from the same occurs.

The provisions relative to probable or certain responsibilities, legal proceedings in process and
compensation or pending obligations of an undetermined amount of an environmental nature not
covered by contracted insurance policies are endowed when the liability or the obligation establishing
the compensation becomes effective.

As of 30 June 2017, the costs or expenses incurred with regard to environmental aspects are
insignificant.

As for any such potential contingencies as may arise in the field of the environment, the directors do
not believe that they would have any significant impact on the Interim Condensed Consolidated

Translation of a report and consolidated financial statements originally issued in Spanish. In the event of
discrepancy, the Spanish-language version prevails

**INDEPENDENT AUDIT REPORT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

To the Shareholders of EMPARK APARCAMIENTOS Y SERVICIOS, S.A.:

**Report on the consolidated financial statements**

We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of EMPARK APARCAMIENTOS Y
SERVICIOS, S.A. (the parent company) and its subsidiaries (the Group), which comprise consolidated statement
of financial position at December 31, 2016, the consolidated income statement, the global consolidated income
statement, the consolidated statement of changes in equity, the consolidated statement of cash flow, and the
notes thereto for the year then ended.

**_Directors’ responsibility for the consolidated financial statements_**

The directors of the parent company are responsible for the preparation of the accompanying consolidated
financial statements so that they give a true and fair view of the consolidated equity and consolidated financial
position and the consolidated results of EMPARK APARCAMIENTOS Y SERVICIOS, S.A. and its subsidiaries, in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, as adopted by the European Union, and other
provisions in the regulatory framework applicable to the Group in Spain, and for such internal control as they
determine is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

**_Auditor’s responsibility_**

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the accompanying consolidated financial statements based on our
audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with prevailing audit regulations in Spain. Those standards require
that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the
consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud
or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the preparation of
consolidated financial statements by the directors of the parent company in order to design audit procedures that
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and
the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
presentation of the consolidated financial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit
opinion.

**_Opinion_**

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view, in all material
respects, of the consolidated equity and consolidated financial position of EMPARK APARCAMIENTOS Y
SERVICIOS, S.A. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2016, and its consolidated results and consolidated cash
flow for the year then ended, in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, as adopted by the
EU, and other provisions in the regulatory framework for financial information applicable in Spain.

**Report on other legal and regulatory requirements**

The accompanying consolidated 2016 management report contains such explanations as the directors of the
parent company consider appropriate concerning the situation of the Group, the evolution of its business and
other matters; however, it is not an integral part of the consolidated financial statements. We have checked that
the accounting information included in the aforementioned consolidated management report agrees with the
2016 consolidated financial statements. Our work as auditors is limited to verifying the consolidated management
report in accordance with the scope mentioned in this paragraph, and does not include the review of information
other than that obtained from the accounting records of EMPARK APARCAMIENTOS Y SERVICIOS, S.A. and its
subsidiaries.

**2 Summary of the main accounting principles**

**_2.1 Reporting rules_**
The financial information listed in these annual reports has been drafted using the International
Financial Reporting Standards adopted by the European Union (IFRS-EU) and becomes effective at
the close of the financial year. Regarding the criteria used to apply these regulations, it is worth
mentioning that the Group has opted, in cases where the IFRS-EU allows different alternative criteria,
to value the tangible and intangible assets at historical cost. The Consolidated Annual Report have
been prepared from the perspective of modified historical cost, with the exception of the case of
derivative financial instruments, which have been valued at reasonable value. These criteria are the
same ones applied in 2015.

The Group applied the IFRS-EU for the first time in financial 2009 for drafting the consolidated
financial statements.

**_2.2 Accounting principles applied_**
The Consolidated Annual Report is submitted in euros and all of the values are rounded to thousands
of euros, unless indicated otherwise.

These annual accounts have been drawn up by the Directors of the Company to be submitted for the
approval of the General Meeting of Shareholders, it being considered that they will be approved with
no modification whatsoever.

_a) Regulations and interpretations approved by the European Union, applicable for the first time during_
_this financial year._
The accounting policies used for preparing these consolidated annual reports are the same as those
applied to the consolidated annual report for the financial year ended 31 December 2015, as no
modifications applicable for the first time during this period to regulations had an effect on the Group.

_b) Standards and interpretations issued by the IASB but do not apply to this financial year_
The Group has the intention to adopt any standards, interpretations and modifications to standards
issued by the IASB, the application of which is not mandatory in the European Union on the date on
which this consolidated annual report are drafted, if applicable to the group when they come into force.


-----

Although the Group is currently analysing the impact, based on the analysis carried out to date, the
Group believes that their application will not have a significant impact on its consolidated annual report.

**_2.3 Changes in Shareholders_**
During 2016 the company purchased 7,042 treasury shares with a nominal value of 6.01 euros each
and subsequently it reduced its Share Capital by 42 thousands of euros through the amortisation of
these treasury shares. The company has paid 176 thousands of euros for the shares which it has
purchased, causing a reduction in voluntary reserves of 134 thousands of euros.

At the end of the 2016 financial year, the called capital stock is divided into 11,340,101 fully called
and paid up ordinary shares with a nominal value of 6.01 euros each, numbered in sequence from
1 to 11,340,101.

At the end of the 2015 financial year, the called capital stock was divided into 11,347,143 fully called
and paid up ordinary shares with a nominal value of 6.01 euros each, numbered in sequence from
1 to 11,347,143.

The share premium has the same restrictions and can be used for the same purposes as voluntary
reserves, including its conversion into share capital.

At 31 December 2016, the companies with stakes in the share capital are the following: (see note 14)

**_2.5 Working capital and going concern_**
As of 31 December 2016, the group presents working capital of 9,648 thousands of euros, and
15,134 thousands of euros in 2015.

The Group operates a centralised cash pooling system, by means of which Empark Aparcamientos
y Servicios, S.A. handles cash requirements at the group level.

Additionally, the group has lines of credit and other financial resources available to meet its cash
needs. (see note 21)

Therefore, the Board of Directors considers it appropriate to prepare the annual reports based on the
operating company principle, which means the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities for the
amounts and according to how they are classified in the annual reports.

**_2.6 Accounting estimates and judgements_**
The information contained in these Consolidated Annual reports is the responsibility of the Group’s
Board of Directors. In the Consolidated Annual Report for the financial years ended in 2016 and 2015
have been carried out using estimates by the Group’s Board of Directors to value some of the assets,
liabilities, revenues, expenses and commitments listed in them. These estimates essentially refer to:

- Assessment of possible impairment losses on certain non-financial assets.

- Recovery of assets through deferred tax.

- Provisions for major repairs, replacements and fees.

- Evaluation of possible contingencies due to legal and tax risks.

_Assessment of possible impairment losses on certain non-financial assets_
The valuation of non-current assets other than financial assets requires the use of estimates to
determine their fair value for the purpose of evaluating any potential deterioration, especially for
goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life. In order to establish this fair value, the
Company Directors estimate the future cash flows expected from the assets or the cash generating
units to which they belong and apply an appropriate discount rate in order to calculate the current
value of those cash flows. Future cash flows depend on whether budgets for the following five
financial years are met, whereas discount rates depend on interest rates and the risk premium
associated with each cash generation unit. Note 6 provides details of hypotheses used to calculate
the value in use of cash generation units, including goodwill.

_Recovery of assets through deferred taxes_
Deferred tax assets are recorded for all temporary deductible differences, negative tax bases pending
compensation and deductions pending application for which it is probable that the Company will have
future taxable earnings allowing these assets to be applied. The Directors have to make significant
estimates to establish the sum of deferred tax assets which may be registered, considering the
amounts and dates on which future tax earnings will be obtained and the reversal period of temporary
taxable differences.

_Provisions for major repairs, replacements and fees_
Under non-current and current liabilities of the consolidated financial situation statement, the Group
has registered provisions totalling 50,757 thousands of euros (51,432 thousands of euros at
31 December 2015). Making assumptions and estimates regarding the discount rate and the
expected costs to be incurred is an essential part of determining the value of these provisions.

These estimates were carried using the best available information as of 31 December 2016 and 2015
regarding the analysed facts. However, it is possible that events that may occur in the future require
modifying these estimates, which would be carried out in accordance with IAS 8 if applicable.

**_2.7 Resource management policies_**
The Group manages its investments after having carried out an in depth examination and control of
potentially attractive projects from the environmental, socio-labour, commercial, financial and
economic perspectives, for the purpose of achieving sustainable and balanced growth.

In carrying out this task, the Group’s shareholders aim to be in a desired position of balance
regarding expected investment profits and the risk level that can be assumed.

**_2.8 Consolidation policies_**
During financial years 2016 and 2015, the individual annual accounting closing date for all companies
included in the scope of consolidation was the same. Likewise, for the purpose of uniformly
presenting the different items that comprise these consolidated annual report, uniform accounting
criteria has been applied using the parent company’s accounting criteria as a basis. The following
methods have been applied to prepare the Consolidated Annual Report:

**a. Full consolidation method: All companies considered subsidiaries are fully consolidated. For**
these purposes subsidiaries are defined as companies in which Empark Aparcamientos y
Servicios, S.A. has effective control because it possesses more than 50% of voting rights directly
or indirectly by agreements with other shareholders. In assessing whether the Group controls
another organisation, consideration is given to the existence and impact of potential voting rights
which can currently be exercised or converted. Inclusion in the scope of consolidation of the Group
is carried out from the moment effective control of the subsidiary is formally established. The value
of shareholdings of minority shareholders in the financial year’s results of dependant companies
consolidated by overall integration are presented in the “Minority Shareholders” chapters of the
consolidated financial situation statement and “Results attributed to Minority Shareholders” of the
consolidated statement of results. (See note 20).

**b. Consolidation method by the equity method: Investment in associates are initially recorded at**
cost and their book value is increased or decreased to recognise the portion corresponding to the
investor in the financial year results obtained by the investee company after the date of acquisition.
In their result from the financial year, the investor recognises the portion of the results of the
investee company corresponding to them. Distributions received from the investee company
reduce the book value of the investment. It may be necessary to make adjustments to include
alterations to the stake in the investee company as a result of changes in another global result of
the investee company.

**c. Proportional integration method: Applied to those JVs in which the management of companies**
in which stakes are held is carried out jointly by the dominant group and by third parties unrelated
to the group. Assets and liabilities assigned to joint operations, or those controlled in conjunction
with other participants, are presented in the consolidated financial situation statement, classified in
accordance with their specific nature by existing share percentage. Similarly, income and
expenditure originating in joint businesses are presented in the consolidated statement of results,
in accordance with their specific nature, also by the aforementioned share percentage.

**d. Balances and transactions with Group companies: Balances and transactions between Group**
companies are eliminated in the consolidation process.

**e. Conversion of financial statements into currency other than the Euro: The financial**
statements of subsidiaries and joint ventures, whose records are denominated in a currency other
than the Euro included in the consolidation process are translated to euros by applying the
year-end exchange rates to all its assets and liabilities except the balances of the shares held in
companies of the group and associated companies, which are converted using the rate at the time
they were included in the group. The shares held in companies of the group are eliminated against
the shareholder equity, except in the associated companies, which are converted at the exchange
rate at closing. The results are translated to euros at the average exchange rate for the year.
Differences arising during the translation process are recorded in the shareholder equity section as
“currency translation differences”.


-----

**The consolidation has been carried out on the basis of the following criteria:**

- The companies in which Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A. has more than a 50% stake in
the registered capital and/or whose management is effectively controlled by it, were fully
consolidated.

- Temporary Joint Ventures are integrated into the individual financial statements using the
proportional integration method.

- Companies in which Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A. has a stake of between 20% and
50 %, are integrated using the equity method.

The annual accounts of the foreign companies have been converted into euros on the basis of the
year-end exchange rate for the assets and liabilities and the year’s average exchange rate for the
profit and loss accounts. The equity corresponding to consolidated companies whose currency is not
the euro has been converted using historic exchange rates.

Third party shares in shareholders equity and results of companies consolidated using the overall
integration method are reflected under the “minority interest” items of the consolidated financial
situation statement and “Earnings attributed to minority interests” of the consolidated statement of
results, respectively. (See note 20).

_a) Subsidiaries_
Subsidiaries are those organisations, including special purpose entities, over which the Group exerts
or could exert control, directly or indirectly, this being understood as the power to direct the financial
and operating policies of a business in order to derive economic benefits from its activities.

In assessing whether the Group controls another organisation, consideration is given to the existence
and impact of potential voting rights which can currently be exercised or converted. Dependent
companies are consolidated from the date when control is transferred to the Group, and are excluded
from the consolidation perimeter as soon as such control ceases.

The acquisition cost method is used in accounting for the acquisition of subsidiaries. The acquisition
cost method is used in accounting for the acquisition of dependent companies The cost of acquisition
is the fair value of the assets handed over, the asset instruments issued and liabilities incurred or
assumed on the date of exchange, the fair value of any additional consideration dependent on future
events (provided that this is probable and a reliable value can be placed upon it), in addition to those
costs directly attributable to the acquisition.

The assets, liabilities, revenue and expenditure of dependent companies are incorporated in the
consolidated annual accounts on the basis of the full consolidation method:

1. The book values of stakes in the capital stock of dependent companies are compensated for, on
the date of acquisition, through the proportional part which the aforementioned values represent
with regard to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities undertaken.

2. The difference between the book value of the holding in the dependent company and the value
attributable to said holding out of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities undertaken is
recognised, if positive, as consolidation goodwill. Under the exceptional circumstance that the
figure is negative, it is recognised as revenue for the financial year in the consolidated income
statement.

3. The assets and liabilities for group companies are included in the Consolidated financial statement
with the same values that are given in the respective balances of these companies, except
acquired assets and liabilities assumed on the date of acquisition which are included in the
consolidated balance based on their fair value on the date of acquisition, once the amortisations
and impairments arising from this date have been considered.

4. The revenue and expenditure of Subsidiaries are included in the Consolidated Annual Report.

5. Debits and credits between companies included within the consolidation group are cancelled out,
along with revenue and expenditure involved in transactions between such companies, and results
generated on the basis of such transactions, if not performed with third parties.


-----

_b) Associated companies_
Associated companies are organisations over which any of the companies included within the
consolidation group exerts substantial influence. Substantial influence is deemed to exist if the Group
has a stake in the company and can intervene in its financial and operating policy decisions, without
having actual control.

Investment in associates are initially recorded at cost and their book value is increased or decreased
to recognise the portion corresponding to the investor in the financial year results obtained by the
investee company after the date of acquisition. In their result from the financial year, the investor
recognises the portion of the results of the investee company corresponding to them. Distributions
received from the investee company reduce the book value of the investment. It may be necessary to
make adjustments to include alterations to the stake in the investee company as a result of changes
in another global result of the investee company.

Any variations experienced during the financial year in the net equity following elimination of the
proportion based on results generated in transactions with Group companies, and not involving third
parties, increase or reduce, as applicable, the book value of the holding in question to the
corresponding proportion, following consideration of any amortisations and impairments occurring
since the method was applied for the first time.

Profits distributed by the Group included in the consolidated annual report under the equity method
reduce the book value of the holding.

A homogenisation of values and over time is applied to associated investments in the same way as
for subsidiaries.

_c) Joint Ventures (JVs)_
The balance sheets and the profit and loss accounts of these companies have been consolidated
proportionally in the consolidated financial statement and in the consolidated income statement as of
31 December 2016.

The group recognises the proportional part corresponding to it of assets controlled jointly and
liabilities incurred joint ly in accordance with the percentage stake, along with assets attached to joint
operations which are under control and liabilities incurred as a result of joint business.

Similarly, the consolidated statement of results recognises the part corresponding to income
generated and expenses incurred by the joint business. Additionally, the costs incurred with regard to
the stake in the joint business are also recorded.

Non-realised results deriving from reciprocal transactions are eliminated in proportion to the stake, in
addition to the sums of reciprocal assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and cash flows.

- During 2016, the proportional integration method has been used to consolidate Ute Torrellobeta,
Ute Valls, Ute Palma, Ute Devas 1 and Ute Devas 2.

_d) Joint businesses_
The group’s stake in gains or losses subsequent to the acquisition of joint businesses is recognised in
the consolidated statement of results; its stake in transactions subsequent to the acquisition is
recognised in reserves. Accumulated transactions subsequent to the acquisition are adjusted against
the book value of the investment. When the Group’s stake in the losses of a joint business is equal
to, or greater than the value of the stake therein, including unsecured accounts receivable, the Group
recognises losses up to the maximum amount that would correspond to them based on their
percentage stake in the equity deficit, minus tacit gains of the assets of the company in question.

Any unrealised gains from transactions between the Group and its joint businesses are eliminated as
a function of the Group’s percentage stake in these. Any unrealised losses are also eliminated,
unless the transaction provides evidence of a loss due to impairment of the asset being transferred.
When necessary to ensure uniformity with policies adopted by the group, the accounting policies of
joint businesses are amended.


-----

Those joint businesses with a 50% stake, but which maintain effective control of their management
because they directly or indirectly hold over 50% of voting rights due to the existence of agreements
with other shareholders, are accounted for using the overall integration method.

**_2.9 Main valuation standards applied in preparing the consolidated financial situation statement_**
**_and the consolidated statement of results._**
_2.9.1 Intangible assets_
Intangible fixed assets are initially valued at cost, either the acquisition price or production cost. The
cost of intangible fixed assets acquired by means of the combination of businesses is stated as the
fair value on the date of acquisition.

Following initial recognition, the intangible fixed assets are valued at their cost, less the cumulative
amortisation and, where applicable, the cumulative sum of recorded valuation corrections for
impairment.

a) Concessions

Concessions mainly includes the fees paid on certain concessions for the operation of car parks.

These public authority concessions are recognised as assets at cost minus the cumulative
amortisation and the cumulative amount of recognised valuation corrections for impairment.

Concessions also include access rights paid by means of a concession fee during the period of the
concession. In this case the concessions are included under assets at the current value of the
minimum agreed payments without taking contingent payments into consideration.

The concessions are amortised on a linear basis over the period of the concession.

b) Computer applications

Licences acquired for computer programs from third parties are capitalised on the basis of the costs
incurred in acquiring them and preparing the specific program for use.

The Company amortises its computer software on a linear basis, distributing the cost of the assets
over the estimated useful life of the same, which is three years.

The costs connected with the development or maintenance of computer programs are recognised as
an expense when they are incurred. The costs directly connected with the production of individual,
identifiable computer programs produced by the Group, provided that it is considered probable that
they will generate economic benefits greater than the costs for more than one year, are recognised
as intangible fixed assets. Direct costs include the cost of the personnel developing the computer
programs and an appropriate percentage of general costs.

_2.9.2 Tangible fixed assets_
Tangible asset elements are recognised at their cost of acquisition, with the addition of the costs
incurred up until their operational start-up, less the cumulative amortisation and the cumulative sum
of recognised losses.

The costs of the extension, modernisation or improvement of tangible fixed assets are incorporated
within the asset as an increase in its value only if they represent an increase in its capacity,
productivity or an extension to its useful life, and wherever it is possible to calculate or estimate the
book value of the elements cancelled from the inventory having been replaced.

The removal or disposal of any items is reflected in the accounts by eliminating the cost there of and
the corresponding cumulative amortisation.

The costs of major repairs to assets belonging to the group are activated and amortised during the
useful life thereof, whereas recurring maintenance costs are charged to the statement of results
during the financial year in which they are incurred.


-----

The amortisation of tangible fixed assets, except for land, which is not amortised, is calculated in
accordance with the values of the updated cost, following the linear method based on the estimated
useful life, in accordance with the depreciation actually suffered through operation, usage and
enjoyment. The following are the estimated useful lives:

**Estimated useful life**

Buildings and other constructions ......................................................................................................  50
Machinery, installations and tools.......................................................................................................  10
Furniture and fittings...........................................................................................................................  10
Vehicles ..............................................................................................................................................   6
Other fixed assets ..............................................................................................................................   3

The car parks which are part of the property, plant and equipment (in the caption “Buildings”) are
valued at the acquisition price or at the production cost, depreciated on a straight-line basis over the
life of the concession.

Where the book value of an asset is greater than its estimated recoverable value, its value is reduced
immediately down to the recoverable sum.

The income and expenses from selling tangible fixed assets are calculated by comparing the amount
obtained by the sale with the book value and are recorded in the income statement in the
“Impairment and result through disposal of fixed assets” caption.

The residual value and the useful life of the assets are reviewed, with adjustments made if necessary
at the close of each balance sheet.

At least at the close of the financial year, the need to perform valuation corrections based on
impairment in value is analysed

_2.9.3 Impairment losses_
In the case of goodwill, the Group carries out annual value impairment tests. In the case of
depreciable assets, at each accounting closure the Group assesses the existence of any loss in value
that forces it to reduce the carrying amount. If there is any indication of impairment the recoverable
value of the asset is calculated in order to identify the scope of the loss by impairment in case its
recoverable value is lower than its book value, and its effect is recorded in the income statement.
Impairment losses must be assessed for each individual asset. If this is not possible, the impairment
loss is determined for the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash flows independent
of flows from other assets (cash-generating units).

The recoverable amount is the market value (arms length value less associated costs) or the value in
use, whichever is higher. The value in use is calculated from estimated future cash flows, discounted
at a rate that reflects the present market value, taking into account the value of money and specific
risks associated with the asset.

_2.9.4 Interest costs_
Financial expenses directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of fixed assets requiring a
period of time longer than one year in order to be fit for use are included in the cost until such time as
the asset is in operational condition.

_2.9.5 Financial assets_
a) Loans and items receivable:

Loans and items receivable are non-derivative financial assets with sums receivable which are fixed
or can be established and are not listed on an active market. These are included under current
assets, except those with a maturity date beyond twelve months from the date of the consolidated
financial statement, which are classified as non-current assets. Loans and items receivable are
included under “Corporate loans” and “Trade and other receivables” on the consolidated balance
sheet.


-----

These are financial assets are initially valued at their fair value, and subsequently in accordance with
their amortised cost based on the effective rate of interest. Transaction costs directly attributable to
their acquisition are recognised in the statement of results. Quarterly value adjustments for
impairment are made if there is evidence that all amounts owed are not collected. The amount of the
value impairment loss is the difference between the book value of the asset and the value of the
estimated future cash flows, discounted at the effective rate of interest at the time of initial
recognition. Any value corrections, as well as their reversal, if applicable, are recognised on the
consolidated statement of results.

The recognition and reversal of valuation corrections through the impairment of client accounts
receivable have been included under “Provisions and losses of amounts payable that cannot be
collected” in the consolidated statement of results.

The sums charged to the impairment account are normally cancelled once there is no expectation of
more cash being recovered.

The maximum exposure to credit risk on the date of submission of the information is the fair value of
each of the aforementioned categories of accounts receivable. The Company does not hold any
guaranty as insurance.

b) Investments in group, multi-group and associate companies:

They are valued at their cost less, where applicable, the cumulative value of value impairment
corrections. However, where there is an investment made prior to the classification of a company as
a Group, Multi-group or Associated Company, the cost of the investment is assumed to be its book
value prior to such classification. Prior valuation adjustments entered into the accounts directly under
the net equity are maintained there until cancellation.

Investments in the assets of group and associated companies are included in the accounting records,
under both current assets and non-current.

The current assets include short-term investment in group and associated companies, comprising
corporate loans and other financial assets.

The non-current assets record the balance of long-term investments on group and associated
companies, comprising asset instruments. Asset instruments are broken down in the balances of
holdings in group companies, holdings in associated companies and share disbursements pending
and not called on.

If there exists objective evidence that the book value is unrecoverable, the relevant valuation
correction is applied as the difference between the book value and the recoverable sum, the latter
understood as whichever is the greater of the fair value less the costs of sale and the current value of
the future cash flows derived from the investment.

_2.9.6 Financial derivatives at fair value_
Derivatives are initially recognised at market value on the contracting date. The subsequent changes
in market value are recorded as well on each balance closing date. The method of identifying the
profit and losses will depend on whether the instrument is classified as hedging or not and if so, on
the type of hedging. The different types of hedging designated by the Group are the following:

i. Cash flow hedging: Its purpose is to hedge the exposure to highly probable future transactions and
variations in cash flow. The gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recorded by the non efficient
section of the consolidated statement of results, while the efficient part is identified directly under
net equity of the consolidated financial situation statement. The amount deferred in net equity is
not recognised in the consolidated statement of results until the gains or losses of hedged
transactions are registered in the results, or until the maturity date of transactions. This recognition
is carried out the same way as the results of the hedged item.

In the case of derivatives that do not qualify as hedge items, changes in reasonable value are
recorded on the consolidated statement of results.


-----

_2.9.7 Business Combinations and Goodwill_
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition cost method which entails recognising
the fair value of the assets and liabilities identified in the acquired business. Goodwill is the positive
difference between the cost of an investment and the value of the aforementioned assets and
liabilities. Consolidated goodwill does not depreciate and is subject to the impairment test.
(see note 6)

Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units (CGU) with the aim of testing losses through
impairment. The allocation is made to those CGUs that are expected to benefit from the business
combination in which the goodwill arose.

At least annually, it is analysed if there are indications of impairment in value of the cash generating
units to which goodwill has been assigned, and if this is the case the possible impairment in value is
checked in accordance with Note 6.

During 2016 Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A, acquired 5,250 shares in Estacionamientos
Alhóndiga, S.A. which is 25% of the share capital, from Construcciones y Promociones Balzola, S.A.
for 1,250 thousands of euros. It also acquired 5,250 shares in Estacionamientos Alhóndiga, S.A.
which is 25% of the share capital, from Concesionaria Lagunak, S.L. for 1,425 thousands of euros.
Consequently Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A is the sole shareholder with 100% of the
shares.

The fair value of the assets and liabilities of Estacionamientos Alhóndiga, S.A. on the date of
acquisition is as follows:

**Book value**
**before           Fair**

**(Thousands of euros)                                                 acquisition          value**

Intangible fixed assets..................................................................................     5,313        6,043
Assets through deferred tax .........................................................................       195          195
Trade debtors and other accounts receivable ..............................................         8            8
Cash and other equivalent liquid assets.......................................................       672          672
Long-term provisions ....................................................................................       (23)          (23)

Short-term debts...........................................................................................      (519)         (519)
Short-term debts with group and associated companies .............................       (20)          (20)
Trade creditors and other accounts payable ................................................      (386)         (386)
Short-term accruals and deferrals ................................................................       (18)          (18)

4,270        5,000

Goodwill arising during the transaction ........................................................                      –

Cost of acquisition ........................................................................................                  5,000

The difference arising between the fair value and book value of the acquired assets and liabilities
assumed which amount to 730 thousands of euros has been assigned in full to intangible fixed
assets.

_2.9.8 Stock_
Inventories are valued at cost or their net realizable value, whichever is lower. The cost of inventories
is determined using the weighted average cost method.

The cost of finished products and products in progress, which corresponds to developments in
progress and those completed, includes costs incurred in the construction of car parks intended for
assignment of usage.

Parking spaces held for sale and included in inventories are valued at the acquisition price or
production cost.

If the cost is greater than the market value, the relevant valuation corrections are applied, and are
recognised as an expense in the profit and loss account. If the circumstances leading to the value


-----

correction cease to exist, the sum of the correction is subject to reversion and is recognised as
revenue in the consolidated income statement.

_2.9.9 Cash and other equivalent liquid assets_
Cash and other equivalent liquid assets include cash on hand, demand deposits at banks, and short
term, high liquid investments which initially have a maturity of three months or less and are not
subject to a significant risk of changes in value.

This section includes the short term restricted cash flow. This concept collects the investments of the
same nature and maturity affected by financing of specific infrastructure projects, whose availability is
restricted by financing contracts as guarantee to cover specific short term obligations relative to
interests or principle of the debt as well as for the future maintenance of the infrastructure.

_2.9.10 Net worth_
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new
shares are recognised in equity as a deduction, net of taxes. Acquisitions of controlling group treasury
stock for the consideration paid including attributable related costs are deducted from equity. When
these shares are sold or subsequently reissued, any amount received net of costs is included in net
equity.

The basic earning per share is calculated as the ratio between the net profits attributed to the
controlling company and the average weighted number of ordinary shares in circulation during said
period. In turn, the diluted profit by action is calculated as the quotient between the net incomes
attributed to the ordinary shareholders and the average weighted number of ordinary shares in
circulation during said period.

In the case of the Group’s consolidated annual accounts corresponding to financial years ending
31 December 2016 and 2015, the basic earnings per share coincide with diluted earnings per share.

_2.9.11 Provisions for employees_
a) Pension commitments:

Fixed provision pension plans

Pension plans which are not classified as fixed contribution plans are deemed as fixed provision
arrangements. In general, fixed provision plans establish the sum of the provision to be received by
the employee at the time of retirement, normally in accordance with one or more factors, such as
age, years of service and remuneration.

The Group recognises in its balance sheet a provision for fixed provision pension plans based on the
difference between the current value of the committed remunerations and the fair value of any
possible assets subject to commitments which are to be used to settle the obligations, with any
appropriate deduction being made in accordance with the sum of the costs of past services not yet
recognised.

If as a consequence of this prior difference an asset is recognised, its valuation cannot exceed the
current value of benefits that could revert to the Group as direct reimbursements or lesser future
contributions, adding, if applicable, the part pending assignation to results from the cost of past
services. Any adjustment which the Group may be required to make on the basis of this limit in the
valuation of the assets is attributed directly to the net equity, being recognised as reserves.

The actual value of the obligation is determined through actuarial methods of calculation and
unbiased and compatible financial and actuarial assumptions.

Any variation in calculation of the current value of the committed remunerations or, as applicable, the
corresponding assets, at the date of close, as a result of actuarial profits and losses, is recognised in
the financial year during which it arises, recorded directly in the net equity as reserves. For these
purposes, profits and losses cover only variations arising through changes in actuarial hypotheses or
adjustments based on experience.

Costs of past services are recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement, except in
the case of revocable rights, in which case they are attributed to the consolidated income statement
on a linear basis over the remaining period up until the rights based on past services become
irrevocable. However, if an asset is derived, the revocable rights are attributed to the income
statement immediately, unless a reduction occurs in the current value of the provisions which may be
returned to the Group in the form of direct reimbursement or reduced future contributions, in which
case the excess above this reduction is attributed immediately to the consolidated income statement.

As of 31 December 2016, there are no people to whom Group companies have retirement
commitments.

b) Redundancy compensation:

Redundancy compensation is paid to employees as a result of a decision by the Group to terminate
their employment contracts prior to the normal retirement age, or if the employee agrees to retire
voluntarily in exchange for such provisions. The Group recognises these provisions when a proven
commitment has been agreed for the termination of the employment of workers, in accordance with a
detailed, formal plan, with no possible withdrawal, or an agreement has been reached to provide
redundancy compensation as a result of an offer made in order to encourage voluntary redundancies.
Those provisions which are not payable within 12 months of the date of the balance sheet are
discounted at their current value.

_2.9.12 Transactions among related parties_
In general, operations among related parties are accounted for at the initial point at their fair value. In
any case, if the agreed price differs from the fair value, the difference is recorded in accordance with
the economic reality of the operation. The subsequent valuation is made in accordance with the terms
set forth in the applicable regulations.

_2.9.13 Subsidies_
A subsidy is considered not refundable when there is an individual concession agreement for the
subsidy, all the conditions for its concession have been met and there are no reasonable doubts that
payment will be collected.

The monetary type subsidies are valued using the fair value of the awarded amount.

_2.9.14 Provisions and contingent liabilities_
Provisions for contingencies and expenses are accounted for in accordance with the estimated
amount required to deal with probable or certain responsibilities arising from legal proceedings in
progress and for compensation and pending obligations of an undetermined amount, guarantees or
other similar sureties.

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation, either legal or implicit, as a
result of past events and it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the
obligation and the amount can be estimated reliably.

Provisions are valued at the current value of the disbursements which are expected to be required in
order to settle the obligation, using a pre-tax rate which reflects the opinions of the current market as
to the current value of money and the specific risks of the obligation. Adjustments in the provision
based on any updates are recognised as a financial expense as they accrue.

Provisions maturing within one year or less and with an insignificant financial impact are not
discounted.

Contingent liabilities are possible obligations arising as a result of past events, the materialisation of
which depends on whether or not one or more future events should occur, outside the control of the
Group.

Given the activities in which the Group is currently engaged it has no liabilities, expenses, assets or
provisions and contingencies of an environmental nature which could prove significant with reference
to its equity, its financial situation and its results. Hence, specific breakdowns are not included in the
report herein on the consolidated annual accounts with regards information on environmental issues.


-----

Costs derived from the protection and improvements of the environment are attributed to the
consolidated results for the financial year in which they are incurred, irrespective of the point when
the monetary or financial flow derived from them occurs.

When such expenses involve the acquisition of fixed assets the purpose of which is to minimise
environmental impact and to protect and improve the environment, these are included in the accounts
as an increase in the value of fixed assets.

_2.9.15 Financial liabilities_
Debts and items payable

These liabilities are initially carried at the fair net value of the expenses incurred in the transaction,
subsequently recording these by their amortised cost according to the effective interest method. The
effective interest rate is the discount rate equal to the expected flow of future payments foreseeable
up until maturity of the liability. In the case that the effective interest rate is initially considered
different from the market interest, the liability is valued taking into account the actual value of the
future flows at that market rate in the case of loans with set interest rates. If said interest rate is not
fulfilled, the valuation of these is also carried out at the aforementioned market interest rate.

In the event of a renegotiation of existing debts, it is considered that no substantial modification has
occurred to the financial liability if the lender of the new loan is the same as that which granted the
initial loan and the current value of the cash flows, including the associated issuance and execution
costs using the effective interest method, varies by no more than 10% from the current value of the
cash flows pending payment on the original liability, calculated in accordance with this same method.

_2.9.16 Corporation tax and deferred taxes_
The Group has since 1 January 2005 paid taxes under the consolidated taxation system at Cintra
Concesiones de Infraestructuras de Transporte, S.A., as a result of the change in ownership which
occurred in 2004, following which the Dominant Company fell within the aforementioned tax
consolidation perimeter. The group previously paid taxes under the consolidated taxation system as
part of the Ferrovial, S.A. Group. During 2009, as a result of the sale transaction referred, the Group
left the aforementioned tax system, and on 31 December 2009 the company applied to pay taxes as
a tax group, with effect from 1 January 2010. This group comprises the following companies:

- Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A.

- Dornier, S.A.U.

- Femet, S.A.

- Guadianapark, S.A.

- Balsol 2001, S.A.

- Empark Infraestructuras, S.A.

- Empark Aparcamientos Andalucía, S.L.

- Eospark Gestora de Participaciones, S.A.

- Maksu España, S.L.

- Car Parking, S.L.U.

- I Mas D Parking, S.L.U.

Corporate tax expense (income) is the amount that accrues on this account in the fiscal year and
includes both the expense (income) for current tax and deferred tax.

Both the expense (income) derived from current and from deferred taxes are recorded in the
consolidated income statement. However, the taxation effect connected with items directly recorded in
the consolidated net worth statement is recognised in the net worth.


-----

Assets or liabilities based on current tax are valued for the sums expected to be paid to or recovered
from the tax authorities, employing the regulations in force or approved and pending publication at the
date of close of the financial year.

Deferred taxes are calculated in accordance with the liability method, based on the temporary
differences arising between the taxable base sums of the assets and their book values. However,
they are not recognised when deferred taxes are the result of the initial recognition of an asset or a
liability in a transaction other than a combination of businesses which, at the time of the transaction,
does not affect either the book result or the calculation base for the tax. Deferred tax is established
by applying the regulations and taxation rates approved or about to be approved at the date of the
balance sheet, and which are expected to be applied when the corresponding asset through deferred
tax is realised or the deferred tax liability settled.

Assets through deferred taxes are recognised to the extent that it is considered probable that future
taxable profits will be made which could be used to compensate for temporary differences.

Deferred taxes on temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries, associates and
consortiums are recognised, except in cases where the Group can control the timing of reversion of
temporary differences and it is probable that they will not revert in foreseeable future.

The term consolidated corporate income tax includes all taxes, national and foreign, related to profits
subject to tax. Consolidated corporation tax also includes other taxes such as taxes on repatriated
profits and any other levy taken as the basis for calculating the accounting result.

The corporation tax expense reflected in the consolidated financial statements is calculated by
aggregating the expense registered for each company that belongs to the consolidated group,
increased or decreased, as appropriate, by elimination of accounting consolidation adjustments and
by the differences arising between the taxable base sums of the assets and liabilities and their book
values in the Consolidated Annual Report (balance sheet method).

Deferred taxes are not recognised when the transaction has no effect on the book and/or fiscal value
of the assets or liabilities involved. In the case of business combinations, the corresponding deferred
taxes derived from the price assigning process and the fiscal amortisation of the generated goodwill
in each case is registered.

The assets and liabilities through deferred taxes are calculated at current taxation rates. At the date
of the consolidated income statement and which are foreseen to be applicable during the period in
which the asset is realised or the liability is settled. They are debited or credited to the income
statement except when they refer to items that are directly recorded as equity, in which case they are
accounted for as debit or credit to said accounts. By non distributed profit of the subsidiaries, there is
no liability through deferred taxes when the Group can control the reversion of the temporary
differences and it is not probable that these will be reverted in a foreseeable future. Deferred tax
assets and tax credits derived from negative tax bases are recognised when it is probable that the
Group may recover these in the future regardless of the time in which they are recovered and always
when the recovery is prior to the legal reversion period. The assets and liabilities through deferred
taxes are not deducted and are classified as a non-current asset (liability) in the balance sheet. At
each year-end, the recognised Assets through deferred taxes are reviewed.

_2.9.17 Conversion of foreign currency transactions_
The annual accounts of companies in foreign currency have been converted to euros using the
closing exchange rate method in accordance with the following rates:

**31/12/2016     31/12/2016     31/12/2015     31/12/2015**

-----

_2.9.18 Recognition of revenue_
Revenue and expenses are attributed in accordance with the accrual principle, in other words based
on when the true value of the goods and services they represent becomes current, irrespective of
when the monetary or financial value arising from them is realised.

Revenue is recorded at the fair value of the consideration to be received and represents the sums
receivable for goods delivered and services provided within the ordinary course of the Group’s
activities minus returns, rebates, discounts and VAT.

The Group recognises revenue when the amount thereof can reliably be valued, it is probable that
future economic benefits will be received by the Group and specific conditions are met for each of the
activities, as detailed below. The amount of the revenue cannot be reliably assessed until all
contingencies connected with the sale have been resolved. The Group bases its estimates on
historical results, taking into account the type of customer, type of transaction and the specific terms
of each agreement.

**a) It is worth making the following distinctions within the car park business:**

a.1) Off-street and mixed parking

a.2) On-street parking (ORA)

a.3) Resident parking

a.1) Off-street and mixed parking

Off-street car park revenues are entered when the hourly parking rate is paid and, in the case of
season ticket-holders, on an accrual basis. Mixed car parks (with public and private spaces) record
revenues as follows: in the case of public spaces, in the manner described in the preceding
paragraph; and in case of private spaces, the amount received is recorded in the income statement
at the time of the transfer of concession usage of the corresponding parking spaces.

The cost of residential spaces is recognised in inventories and are transcribed to the income
statement on the date of the transfer of the concession of usage.

a.2) On-street parking (ORA)

Revenue from the ORA on-street car parks meter service is mainly based on the sum corresponding
to the cost of providing the service plus a percentage, generally between 1% and 3%, of the surplus
between that cost and the funds collected. In some ORA on-street car parks contracts, revenue is
obtained as a fixed percentage of the take, to be paid by the Local Council. This is recorded in the
accounts at the time when the service is provided.

a.3) Resident parking

This business involves the construction of car parks whose spaces are sold directly to the end
customer during the time frame of the concession. The sales and costs are not recorded until the
parking space is delivered, which tends to coincide with the signature of the contract, or exceptionally,
the public deed of sale.

_2.9.19 Leases_
a) When one of the Group’s companies is the lessee – Financial leasing

The Group leases certain tangible fixed assets. Leases of tangible fixed assets where the Group
substantially retains the risks and benefits derived from ownership are classified as financial leases.
Financial leases are capitalised at the commencement of the lease at the fair value of the property
leased, or the current value of the minimum payments agreed under the lease, whichever is lower. To
calculate the actual value, the implicit contract interest rate is used, and if this cannot be determined,
the Group interest rate for similar transactions.

Each lease payment is distributed between the liability and financial charges. The total financial
charge is distributed over the course of the lease and attributed to the consolidated income statement
of the financial year when it accrues, applying the effective interest rate method. Contingent


-----

payments are recorded as a cost for the financial year when incurred. The corresponding lease
obligations, net of financial charges, are included in “Other items payable”. Fixed assets acquired
under a financial lease system depreciate during their useful life or the duration of the contract,
whichever is lower.

b) When one of the Group’s companies is the lessee – Operational leasing

Leases where the lessor retains a significant art of the risks and benefits of ownership are classified
as operating leases. Payments under operating leases (net of any incentive received from the lessor)
are charged to the consolidated outcome statement of the financial year when they accrue on a linear
basis over the period of the lease.

c) When the group is the lessor

Where assets are the leased under a financial lease arrangement, the current value of lease
payments, discounted at the implicit interest rate of the contract, is recognised as an account
receivable. The difference between the gross amount to be received and the current value of this sum
for interest not accrued is attributed to the Consolidated Statement of profit or loss of the financial
year when said interest accrues, in accordance with the effective interest rate method.

Where assets are leased under an operating lease arrangement, the asset is included in the
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position in accordance with its nature. Revenue derived from the
lease is recognised in a linear manner over the course of the lease period.

_2.9.20 Redundancy compensation_
In accordance with current legislation, the Company is obliged to pay compensation to employees
who, under certain circumstances, have their employment contracts terminated. Redundancy
compensation payments which can be reasonably quantified are entered as an expense in the
financial year in which a valid expectation created by the Company exists with respect to the third
parties affected.

**3 Management of financial and capital risks**
The Group’s activities are exposed to various financial risks: market risk (including exchange rate
risk, interest rate risk and price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.

Risk management is controlled by the Senior Economic and Financial Management of Empark
Aparcamientos y Servicios S.A., which identifies, evaluates and pages financial risks in accordance
with the policies approved by the Board of Directors. The Board provides policies for overall risk
management and for specific areas such as exchange rate risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, use of
derivative and non-derivative instruments and the investment of surplus liquidity.

The financial risks to which the Company is exposed include those derived from the guarantees and
bonds required in order for the company to undertake its activities.

During the 2016 and 2015 financial years, the Company had in place bank guarantees with third
parties and guarantee commitments with other Group companies in order to engage in its business.
(see note 38)

**_Market Risk: Exchange rate risk_**
Management has established an exchange rate risk management policy for foreign currencies other
than the operating currency. Forward contracts, negotiated by the finance department, are used to
manage exchange rate risks arising from future trade transactions and recognised assets and
liabilities. Exchange rate risk arises where future commercial transactions or recognised assets or
liabilities are quoted in a currency other than the organisation’s operating currency.

The Group has no significant exchange rate risk, as most of its assets and liabilities, revenue and
expenses, are expressed in euros. Companies that, due to their origin (United Kingdom and Turkey),
use the currency of their country of origin, also express their assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses
in that currency.


-----

**_Market Risk: Exchange rate risk from cash flows and fair value_**
As of 31 December 2016, if the interest rates on outside resources quoted in euros had been
50 basis points higher/lower, with all other variables remaining constant, the result after taxes for the
period would have been (1,078)/1,078 thousands of euros lower/higher, mainly as a result of an
increase/decrease in the cost of interest on variable-rate loans.

The Group carries out the corresponding interest rate hedges by contracting an IRS (Interest Rate
Swap). (see note 23)

Interest rate risk occurs as a result of possible losses caused by variations in the fair value or future
cash flows of a financial instrument as a result of changes in market interest rates. The Group’s
exposure to the risk of changes in interest rates mainly arises from variable interest rate credits and
loans.

Out of the 457,501 thousands of euros of long term debt in 2016 (463,971 of debt minus
6,470 thousands of euros of amortised cost), only 190,315 thousands of euros are influenced by the
Euribor. In 2015, the amount of long term debt held is 457,660 thousands of euros (465,984 of debt
minus 8,324 thousands of euros of amortised cost), and the amount influenced by interest rates is
189,094 thousands of euros.

Below can be found details of net non-current funding classified based on interest rate structure:

**457,501       457,660**

Variable interest rate funding is Euribor-linked.

The Company has no need to contract long term debt with the December 2013 bond issue

**_Credit risk_**
Credit risk is handled by groups. Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, financial
derivative instruments and deposits held in banks and financial institutions, along with wholesale and
retail clients including pending accounts receivable and committed transactions. With respect to
banks and financial institutions, only financial institutions that are known to be reputable and solvent
are accepted.

Credit risk occurs as a result of the possible loss caused by a breach of contractual obligations by the
Company’s counterparts, in other words the possibility of not recovering financial assets at the value
accounted for and within the established deadlines.

Maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 December is as follows:

**Thousands of euros**

Breakdowns are periodically prepared showing the age of each balance receivable, which serve as a
basis for managing their collection. Debt with an age in excess of 1 year is reviewed on an annual
basis and a monthly insolvency provision is allocated.

**Total (note 9a) .........................................................** **904     39,616      1,025     32,462**

**_Liquidity risk_**
Prudent management of liquidity risk involves holding sufficient cash and transferable securities,
having access to finance through a sufficient sum of agreed credit facilities and having the capacity to
unwind market positions. Given the dynamic nature of underlying businesses, the aim of the Group’s
treasury department is to maintain funding availability by ensuring that lines of credit are available.

Liquidity risk occurs as a result of the possibility that the Company may not have access to liquid
funds of a sufficient quantity and at an appropriate cost in order at all times to meet its payment
obligations.

Through the companies Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A. and Dornier, S.A.U., at all times the
group has guaranteed its liquidity requirements through lines of credit with financial entities worth a
total amount of 9,000 thousands of euros, as well as a revolving credit facility with a limit of 30,000
thousands of euros. As of 31 December 2016, it only had the sum of 550 thousand in lines of credit,
however it did not have any RCF.

**_Capital Management_**
The Group manages capital such that a debt ratio that gives financial stability to the group is
maintained; it seeks investments with optimal profitability rates for the purpose of generating greater
solidity and profitability for the Group.


-----

As can be seen on the balance sheet, most of the debt is long term. These ratios reflect the fact that
prudent criteria are used for capital management, as expected cash flows over coming years, along
with the group’s equity situation, will service the debt.

the companies at the time of purchase and which gave rise to the goodwill recognised.

The impairment is calculated by comparing the value of these assets with their fair value, the latter
understood as the value of the future cash flow discounts which it is estimated that the assets will
generate based on objective hypotheses, discounted at an estimated capital cost based on a risk-free
rate using the 30-year bond as a benchmark and the level of risk of the asset, along with an
estimated market premium.

A residual value is furthermore calculated, incorporating the renewal of the contract and growth.

The following assumptions have been assumed to determine the present value of future cash flows
from investments for the 2015 and 2016 years:

– It has been determined that the corresponding investment will generate cash flows with terms up to
maturity; this period is between 5 and 50 years, depending on the concession.

– The associated revenue and expenditure forecasts were performed in accordance with the
following general criteria:


-----

- In the case of revenue, in order to estimate price variations, consideration was given to the
estimated variation in the consumer price index (CPI) in each of the countries where the
investments are operational (2% in both Spain and Portugal), the appropriate price review formulae
as set forth in the concession contracts on the basis of the price variation indices and/or any
specific correction factors which may apply.

Ramp up during the first 2-5 years of the concession has been taken into account in the case of
new contracts, depending on the specific analysis of each contract; subsequently, an evolution in
revenue similar to previous revenue has been estimated.

- In terms of expenditure, the evolution thereof was calculated on the basis of the envisaged
evolution of corresponding CPI rates (2% in both Spain and Portugal), as well as on the planned
evolution of the activity.

- Consideration is also given to the cost of works to be performed in order to keep infrastructure in
perfect usage conditions, based on the best estimate available according to the company's
experience, and taking into consideration the forecast evolution of the business.

- Consideration was given to the future costs and revenue associated with renewals of contracts and
also the investments required for these renewals on the basis of the investments occurring in
previous contracts.

Renewal rates used in different lines of business (off-street, ORA, management) have been
estimated between 75% and 85% based on actual rates obtained by the Group.

- The forecast cash flows obtained on the basis of the projected revenue and expenditure, in
accordance with the aforementioned criteria, were updated at the discount rate resulting from
adding to the long-term cost of money the risk premium assigned by the market to the country
where the Group performs its operations, the risk premium assigned by the market to each
business (both based on a long-term vision), along with the financial structure of the company or
cash-generating unit in question. The discount rate employed was 6.75%.

As a result of the impairment test performed, it has been revealed that the various cash-generating
units to which the various recorded sums of goodwill are assigned will serve to recover the net value
of each of the sums recorded by 31 December 2016, and there is therefore no need to establish any
form of impairment provision.

Similarly, sensitivity analyses have been performed on reasonably possible changes to the main
valuation variables (CPI, inflation, discount rate, renewals) and the recoverable value remain above
the net accounting value.

**_b) Share premium_**
The sum thereof as of 31 December 2016 and 2015 was 36,940 thousands of euros.

**15 Reserves and results from previous years**

- Non distributable Reserves

Companies are obliged to allocate at least 10 percent of the profits of each year to the statutory
reserve until it reaches an amount equal to 20 percent of the share capital. This reserve cannot be
distributed to the shareholders and may only be used to offset losses on the profit and loss account,
provided that sufficient other reserves are not available for this purpose. Under certain conditions it
may also be used to increase the capital stock.

The reserves for goodwill were made up in previous financial years in accordance with section 4 of
article 273 of the amended text of the Spanish Corporations Law (repealed with effect from 1 January
2016) which established that it must contain at least five percent of the goodwill total (note 6) which is
in the balance sheet charged to the profits for the financial year, or if not sufficient, charged to
voluntary reserves, and it was unavailable whilst the corresponding goodwill was recorded in the
Company balance.

This reserve is not available and, pursuant to what is set forth in the single transitory provision of
Royal Decree 602/2016 dated 2 December from 1 January 2016, the sum of the same which
exceeds the goodwill recorded in the balance sheet must be reclassified as voluntary reserves and
will be available.

The group contracts derivative financial instruments (interest rate swaps) with different third parties,
mainly financial institutions with suitable credit ratings ("investment grade") to cover interest rate
fluctuations of their bank loans. These derivatives meet the conditions to be designated as accounting
hedge instruments (cash flow hedges), so any changes to their fair value are temporarily allocated to
net equity. Valuation techniques with observable market data have been used for their valuation. The
most frequently applied evaluation techniques include future price models, using calculations of the
current value of expected cash flows. The models incorporate different data, including credit rating
and interest rate curves. Change in credit risk have neither had a material effect on the efficacy of the
hedge not on the valuation of derivatives designated as such.

On 18 November 2011, Empark Aparcamientos Andalucía, S.L., took out a loan with La Caixa
amounting to 7,000 thousands of euros. This loan is hedged with the same entity for 6,300 thousands
of euros. As of 31 December 2016 the notional figure was 4,925 thousands of euros. Empark
Aparcamientos Andalucía, S.L., pays a fixed rate of 2.83% for this swap.

As of 31 December 2016, the company Aparcamientos Guipuzcoanos, S.A. holds an interest rate
derivative to manage exposure to fluctuations in syndicated credit rates contracted at variable rates.
This contract fixes a range of interest payments and charges, depending on the current market
interest rate (Euribor). As of 31 December 2016 and 2015 the Company had recorded the valuation
of this product, net of the taxation effect, for a sum of 1,097 thousands of euros.

As of 31 December 2016 Concha Parking, S.A. holds an interest rate derivative to manage exposure
to fluctuations of the rates of its bank loans arranged at variable rates. These contracts fix a range of
interest payments and charges depending on the current market interest rate (Euribor). As of
31 December 2016 and 2015 the Company had recorded the valuation of this product, net of the
taxation effect, for a sum of 2,214 thousands of euros.

The valuation of the derivatives owned by the Group as of 31 December 2016 and 2015 is (5,260)
thousands of euros and (4,594) thousands of euros respectively. (see note 19)


-----

The Group classifies valuations at fair value using a hierarchy that reflects the relevance of the
variables employed in the valuations as per the following levels:

a) non-adjusted quoted prices on active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1).

b) variables other than the quoted prices included in Level 1, which can be observed for the asset or
liability, either directly (that is, as prices), or indirectly (that is, derived from prices) (Level 2), and

c) variables, used for the asset or liability, that are not based on observable market data
(unobservable variables – Level 3).

The only Group assets or liabilities valued at fair value are these derivatives (interest swaps), found
in category b) of the previous breakdown (Level 2).

**24 Long-term accruals and deferrals**
The balance of other financial liabilities corresponds in the main to bonds and deposits, guarantees

**27 Tax situation**
In accordance with current legislation, settlement of taxes cannot be considered definitive until such
time as the tax authorities have made their inspection, or the statutory period of limitation (currently
set at four years) has expired. The Company is subject to inspection for the four last financial years
for all applicable taxes, from 2012 to 2015 for Corporation Tax and 2013 to 2016 for other taxes. In
the opinion of the Company Directors, along with their taxation advisers, there exist no fiscal
contingencies for significant sums which could arise, in the event of inspection, from any possible
differing interpretations of the taxation regulations applicable to the transactions undertaken by the
Company.

Law 27/2014, of 27 November, on Corporation Tax, amended the general taxation rate, decreasing
from the rate of 28% in 2015 to the current rate of 25%.

As for the Company's financial risk management policy, this is based on the Group managing its
capital in order to guarantee that it will be in a position to continue operating as a profitable business,
while maximising shareholder return by striking an optimum balance between debt and shareholders
equity.

Below are set out the main risks to which the Group is exposed:

- Liquidity risk: The Group establishes its treasury needs as part of its general policy through the use
of two tools: Treasury budget with a 12-month horizon with monthly detail and updates and
treasury budgets with a 30-day horizon with daily updates and details. These tools identify treasury
needs in volume and time and make plans for new financing needs.

- Credit risk: The Group maintains its cash and cash equivalents in financial institutions with high
credit ratings. It should furthermore be mentioned that there is no significant concentration of credit
risk with third parties.

- Interest rate risk: The interest rate risk of the Group arises basically from long-term borrowings.
The Group has contracted financial instruments that partially cover the risk of possible interest rate
hikes.


-----

- Exchange rate risk: The Group has no significant exchange rate risk since the vast majority of its
assets and liabilities, income and expenses are denominated in euros.

 EMPARK APARCAMIENTOS Y SERVICIOS, S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES

 Consolidated Financial Statements and Consolidated Management Report

 for the year ended December 31, 2015


-----

Translation of a report and consolidated financial statements originally issued in Spanish. In the event of
discrepancy, the Spanish-language version prevails

**INDEPENDENT AUDIT REPORT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

To the Shareholders of EMPARK APARCAMIENTOS Y SERVICIOS, S.A.:

**Report on the consolidated financial statements**

We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of EMPARK APARCAMIENTOS Y
SERVICIOS, S.A. (the parent company) and its subsidiaries (the Group), which comprise consolidated statement
of financial position at December 31, 2015, the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of
comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity, the consolidated cash flow statement,
and the notes thereto for the year then ended.

**_Directors' responsibility for the consolidated financial statements_**

The directors of the parent company are responsible for the preparation of the accompanying consolidated
financial statements so that they give a true and fair view of the consolidated equity and consolidated financial
position and the consolidated results of EMPARK APARCAMIENTOS Y SERVICIOS, S.A. and its subsidiaries, in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, as adopted by the European Union, and other
provisions in the regulatory framework applicable to the Group in Spain, and for such internal control as they
determine is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

**_Auditor's responsibility_**

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the accompanying consolidated financial statements based on our
audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with prevailing audit regulations in Spain. Those standards require
that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement.

An audit requires performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the
consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud
or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the preparation of
consolidated financial statements by the directors of the parent company in order to design audit procedures that
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and
the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
presentation of the consolidated financial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit
opinion.

**_Opinion_**

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view, in all material
respects, of the consolidated equity and consolidated financial position of EMPARK APARCAMIENTOS Y
SERVICIOS, S.A. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2015, and its consolidated results and consolidated cash
flow for the year then ended, in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, as adopted by the
European Union, and other provisions in the regulatory framework for financial information applicable in Spain.

**_Report on other legal and regulatory requirements_**

The accompanying consolidated 2015 management report contains such explanations as the directors of the
parent company consider appropriate concerning the situation of the Group, the evolution of its business and
other matters; however, it is not an integral part of the consolidated financial statements. We have checked that
the accounting information included in the aforementioned consolidated management report agrees with the
2015 consolidated financial statements. Our work as auditors is limited to verifying the consolidated management
report in accordance with the scope mentioned in this paragraph, and does not include the review of information
other than that obtained from the accounting records of EMPARK APARCAMIENTOS Y SERVICIOS, S.A. and its
subsidiaries.

### EMPARK Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A. and Subsidiaries

 Report for financial year 2015

**1 Group’s activities and consolidation scope**

**_1.1 Companies which are part of the Group and their business_**
The EMPARK Group, hereinafter the Group, comprises the dominant company Empark
Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A., and its subsidiaries, joint businesses and associate companies. The
registered company office is in Madrid at Avenida del General Perón nº36.

Through these companies, the Group engages in the following lines of business, which are its
primary reporting segments in accordance with IFRS 8.

Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A. previously named Cintra Aparcamientos, S.A. and prior to
that named Ferrovial Aparcamientos, S.A. and previously Ferrevisa, S.A., has as its main line of
business the construction and operation of car parks under public authority concession
arrangements. Such concessions stipulate that, to fulfil the concession time frames, the car parks
shall be returned to the granting company in perfect conditions of use, without any payment for
provision of service for the Group. The Subsidiaries carry out the same activity as the Parent
Company.

Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A., is the Parent Company of a group of 36 Subsidiaries and
8 Associates; it has stakes in 5 JVs.

For the purpose of drawing up the consolidated annual reports, the assumption is that a group exists
if the dominant company has one or more dependent organisations, over which the dominant
company exerts control either directly or indirectly.

Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A., the dominant company of the Group, was incorporated in
Madrid on 29 July 1986 as a public limited company. It is registered with the Company Register of
Madrid, on sheet M-53866, page 86, volume 14,090, and section 8 of the Companies Book. The most
recent adaptation and revision of its by-laws, based on the Company Register of Madrid, is registered
in volume 21,897, book 0 of section 8, page 222, sheet M-53866, and inscription no. 113.

All of the Group’s subsidiaries have the financial and tax year coinciding with the natural calendar
year and none of these are listed on the Stock Market. The scope of Consolidation is the following:

**2 Summary of the main accounting principles**

**_2.1 Basis of presentation_**
The financial information listed in these annual reports has been drafted using the International
Financial Reporting Standards adopted by the European Union (IFRS-EU) and becomes effective at
the close of the financial year. Regarding the criteria used to apply these regulations, it is worth
mentioning that the Group has opted, in cases where the IFRS-EU allows different alternative criteria,
to value the tangible and intangible assets at historical cost. The Consolidated Annual Reports have
been prepared from the perspective of modified historical cost, with the exception of the case of
derivative financial instruments, which have been valued at reasonable value. These criteria are the
same ones applied in 2014.

The Group applied the IFRS-EU for the first time in financial year 2009 for drafting the consolidated
financial statements.

**_2.2 Accounting principles applied_**
The Consolidated Annual Report is submitted in euros and all of the values are rounded to thousands
of euros, unless indicated otherwise.

These annual accounts have been drawn up by the Directors of the Company to be submitted for the
approval of the General Meeting of Shareholders, it being considered that they will be approved with
no modification whatsoever.


-----

_a) Regulations and interpretations approved by the European Union, applicable for the first time during_
_this financial year._
The accounting policies used for preparing these interim financial statements are the same as those
applied to the consolidated annual report for the financial year ended 31 December 2014, as no new
regulation, interpretation or modification applicable for the first time during this period had an effect on
the Group.

_b) Standards and interpretations issued by the IASB but do not apply to this financial year_
The Group has the intention to adopt any standards, interpretations and modifications issued by the
IASB, the application of which is not mandatory in the European Union on the date on which these
intermediate financial statements are drafted, if applicable to the group when they come into force.
The Group is currently analysing their impact. Based on the analysis carried out to date, the Group
believes that their initial application will not have a significant impact on the consolidated financial
statements.

_IFRS 9 – Financial instruments_
In July 2014, the IASB published the final version of the IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, which includes
all stages of the financial instrument projects and substitutes for the IAS 39 Financial Instruments:
valuation and classification, and all previous versions of the IFRS 9. The standard introduces new
requirements for the classification and valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities,
determining impairment and hedge accounting. IFRS 9 indicates that it is applicable for all financial
years which start from 1 January 2018 and that it can be applied before this time. It must be applied
retroactively, but comparative information does not need to be modified. The adoption of IFRS 9 will
affect the classification and valuation of the Group’s financial assets, but will not have an impact on
the classification and valuation of the Group’s financial liabilities. Nor will it have an effect on the new
impairment calculation method. Regarding hedge accounting, there will be significant changes as
financial hedges which take place during the transition to IFRS 9, which cannot currently be recorded
as accounting hedges in accordance with IAS 39, will be able to be recorded as accounting hedges in
accordance with new regulations.

_IFRS 15 – Revenue from standard client contracts_
IFRS 15 was published in May 2014 and establishes a new five step model which applies to revenue
from client contracts. In accordance with IFRS 15, revenue is classed as a sum which is received by
a company in return for providing goods or services to a client. The principles of IFRS 15 provide a
more structured focus to value and record revenue.

This new standard is applicable to all entities and will repeal any previous revenue recognition
standards. In accordance with the terms set forth in IFRS 15, it must be applied totally or partially on
a retroactive basis for the financial years starting 1 January 2017, and it can be applied in advance.
The Group is currently assessing the impact of IFRS 15 and is planning to adopt it on the indicated
date.

**_2.3 Changes in Shareholders_**
No capital changes were made to the shareholdings during the 2015 financial year.

The make-up of the holdings of the main shareholders as of 31/12/2015 and 31/12/2014 and is as
follows:

**EMPARK, S.A. Shareholders                                               shares             %**

**_2.4 Comparison of the information_**
In accordance with current trading legislation, along with each item of the Consolidated Financial
Situation Statement, Consolidated Statement of Results, Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive
Income, Consolidated Statement of Changes to Net Equity and Consolidated Cash Flows Statement,
as well as figures corresponding to the financial year ending 31 December 2015, for comparative
purposes the administrators submit the items corresponding to the financial year ending
31 December 2014.

In accordance with the terms set forth in the additional unique provision in the “Ruling of 29 January
2016 of the Accounts and Account Auditing Institute (ICAC), regarding the information to be included
in the explanatory notes on the consolidated annual reports regarding average payment periods to
suppliers in trade operations”, in Note 28 the Company solely provides the information relating to the
financial year and does not present comparative information, qualifying these annual accounts as
initial accounts, for these sole purposes, in reference to the application of the principle of consistency
and the comparability requirement.

**_2.5 Negative working capital and operating company_**
As of 31 December 2015, the group presents an operating fund of 15,134 thousands of euros, and
10,073 thousands of euros in 2014. This circumstance, which could be indicative of uncertainty
regarding the continuance of operations of the Group is mitigated by the fact that these types of
situations are common in these types of groups where a large part of the sales are received in cash.

The Group operates a centralised cash pooling system, by means of which Empark Aparcamientos
y Servicios, S.A. handles cash requirements at the group level.

Additionally, the group has lines of credit and other financial resources available to meet its cash
needs. (See note 21).

Therefore, the Board of Directors considers it appropriate to prepare the annual reports based on the
operating company principle, which means the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities for the
amounts and according to how they are classified in the annual reports.

**_2.6 Accounting estimates and judgements_**
The information contained in these Consolidated Annual reports is the responsibility of the Group’s
Board of Directors.

In the Consolidated Annual Reports for the financial years ended in 2015 and 2014 have been carried
out using estimates by the Group’s Board of Directors to value some of the assets, liabilities,
revenues, expenses and commitments listed in them. These estimates essentially refer to:

- Evaluation of potential losses due to the impairment of certain non-financial assets.

- Recovery of assets through deferred tax.

- Provisions for major repairs, replacements and fees.

- Evaluation of possible contingencies due to legal and tax risks.

_Evaluation of potential losses due to the impairment of certain non-financial assets._
The assessment of non-current assets, other than financial assets, requires estimates to be made in
order to determine their fair value, for the purpose of determining possible impairment, especially for
goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life. In order to establish this fair value, the
Company Directors estimate the future cash flows expected from the assets or the cash generating
units to which they belong and apply an appropriate discount rate in order to calculate the current
value of those cash flows. Future cash flows depend on whether budgets for the following five
financial years are met, whereas discount rates depend on interest rates and the risk premium
associated with each cash generation unit. Note 6 provides details of hypotheses used to calculate
the value in use of cash generation units, including goodwill.


-----

_Recover of assets through deferred taxes_
Deferred tax assets are recorded for all temporary deductible differences, negative tax bases pending
compensation and deductions pending application for which it is probable that the Company will have
future taxable earnings allowing these assets to be applied. The Directors have to make significant
estimates to establish the sum of deferred tax assets which may be registered, considering the
amounts and dates on which future tax earnings will be obtained and the reversal period of temporary
taxable differences.

_Provisions for major repairs, replacements and fees_
Under non-current and current liabilities of the consolidated financial situation statement, the Group
has registered provisions totalling 51,432 thousands of euros (52,161 thousands of euros at
31 December 2014). To determine the amount of these provisions, it is necessary to hypothesise and
make estimates regarding discount rates and the costs that are expected to be incurred.

These estimates were carried using the best available information as of 31 December 2015 and 2014
regarding the analysed facts. However, it is possible that events that may occur in the future require
modifying these estimates, which would be carried out in accordance with IAS 8 if applicable.

**_2.7 Resource management policies_**
The Group manages its investments after having carried out an in depth examination and control of
potentially attractive projects from the environmental, socio-labour, commercial, financial and
economic perspectives, for the purpose of achieving sustainable and balanced growth.

In carrying out this task, the Group’s shareholders aim to be in a desired position of balance
regarding expected investment profits and the risk level that can be assumed.

**_2.8 Consolidation policies_**
During financial years 2015 and 2014, the individual annual accounting closing date for all companies
included in the scope of consolidation was the same. Likewise, for the purpose of uniformly
presenting the different items that comprise these consolidated annual report, uniform accounting
criteria has been applied using the parent company’s accounting criteria as a basis. The following
methods have been applied to prepare the Consolidated Annual Reports:

**a. Full consolidation method: All companies considered subsidiaries are fully consolidated. For**
these purposes, subsidiaries are those companies in which Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios,
S.A. maintains effective control because it owns more than 50% of voting rights directly or
indirectly by agreements with other shareholders. In assessing whether the Group controls another
organisation, consideration is given to the existence and impact of potential voting rights which can
actually be exercised or converted. Inclusion in the scope of consolidation of the Group is carried
out from the first moment in which the control of the subsidiary becomes effective. The value of
shareholdings of minority shareholders in the financial year’s results of dependant companies
consolidated by overall integration are presented in the “External partners” chapters of the
consolidated financial situation statement and “Results attributed to external partners” of the
consolidated statement of results. (See note 20).

**b. Consolidation method by the participation method: Investment in associates are initially**
recorded at cost and their book value is increased or decreased to recognise the portion
corresponding to the investor in the financial year results obtained by the investee company after
the date of acquisition. In their result from the financial year, the investor recognises the portion of
the results of the investee company corresponding to them. Distributions received from the
investee company reduce the book value of the investment. It may be necessary to make
adjustments to include alterations to the stake in the investee company as a result of changes in
another global result of the investee company.

**c. Proportional integration method: Applied to those JVs in which the management of companies**
in which stakes are held is carried out jointly by the dominant group and by third parties unrelated
to the group. Assets and liabilities assigned to joint operations, or those controlled in conjunction
with other participants, are presented in the consolidated financial situation statement, classified in
accordance with their specific nature by existing share percentage. Similarly, income and


-----

expenditure originating in joint businesses are presented in the consolidated statement of results,
in accordance with their specific nature, also by the aforementioned share percentage.

d. Balances and transactions with group companies: The balances and transactions with Group
companies are eliminated in the consolidation process.

e. Conversion of financial statements in currencies other than the euro: The financial
statements of subsidiaries and joint ventures, whose records are denominated in a currency other
than the Euro are translated to euros by applying the year-end exchange rates to all its assets and
liabilities except the balances of the shares held in companies of the group and associated
companies, which are converted using the rate at the time they were included in the group. Shares
in group companies are offset against the shareholders equity of the company in which a stake is
held, with the exception of associates, which are valued at the closing exchange rate.

The results are translated to euros at the average exchange rate for the year. Differences arising
during the translation process are recorded in the shareholder equity section as “currency translation
differences”.

**The consolidation has been carried out on the basis of the following criteria:**

- Companies in which Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A. has more than a 50% stake in the
capital stock and/or whose management is effectively controlled by it, are consolidated using the
overall integration method.

- Temporary Joint Ventures are integrated into the individual financial statements using the
proportional integration method.

- Companies in which Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A. has a stake of between 20% and
50%, are integrated using the equity method.

The annual accounts of the foreign companies have been converted into euros on the basis of the
year-end exchange rate for the assets and liabilities and the year’s average exchange rate for the
profit and loss accounts. The shareholders equity of consolidated companies that use an operating
currency other than the Euro have been converted using historical exchange rates.

Third party shares in shareholders equity and results of companies consolidated using the overall
integration method are reflected under the “minority interest” items of the consolidated financial
situation statement and “Earnings attributed to minority interests” of the consolidated statement of
results, respectively. (See note 20).

_a) Dependent companies_
Dependent companies are those organisations, including special purpose vehicles, over which the
Group exerts or could exert control, directly or indirectly, this being understood as the power to direct
the financial and operating policies of a business in order to derive economic benefits from its
activities.

In assessing whether the Group controls another organisation, consideration is given to the existence
and impact of potential voting rights which can actually be exercised or converted. Dependent
companies are consolidated from the date when control is transferred to the Group, and are excluded
from the consolidation perimeter as soon as such control ceases.

The acquisition cost method is used in accounting for the acquisition of dependent companies. The
acquisition cost method is used in accounting for the acquisition of dependent companies The cost of
acquisition is the fair value of the assets handed over, the asset instruments issued and liabilities
incurred or assumed on the date of exchange, the fair value of any additional consideration
dependent on future events (provided that this is probable and a reliable value can be placed upon
it), in addition to those costs directly attributable to the acquisition.

The assets, liabilities, revenue and expenditure of dependent companies are incorporated in the
consolidated annual accounts on the basis of the full consolidation method:


-----

1. The book values of stakes in the capital stock of dependent companies are compensated for, on
the date of acquisition, through the proportional part which the aforementioned values represent
with regard to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities undertaken.

2. The difference between the book value of the holding in the dependent company and the value
attributable to said holding out of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities undertaken is
recognised, if positive, as consolidation goodwill. Under the exceptional circumstance that the
figure is negative, it is recognised as revenue for the financial year in the consolidated income
statement.

3. The assets and liabilities of group companies are included in the consolidated financial statement,
with the same valuations as recorded in the respective balance sheet of the companies in
question, except for assets acquired and liabilities undertaken on the date of acquisition, which are
included in the consolidated balance sheet on the basis of their fair value on the date of
acquisition, following consideration of any amortisations and impairments occurring from that date
onwards.

4. The revenue and expenditure of Subsidiaries are included in the Consolidated Annual Report.

5. Debits and credits between companies included within the consolidation group are cancelled out,
along with revenue and expenditure involved in transactions between such companies, and results
generated on the basis of such transactions, if not performed with third parties.

_b) Associated companies_
Associated companies are organisations over which any of the companies included within the
consolidation group exerts substantial influence. Substantial influence is deemed to exist if the Group
has a stake in the company and can intervene in its financial and operating policy decisions, without
having actual control.

Investment in associates are initially recorded at cost and their book value is increased or decreased
to recognise the portion corresponding to the investor in the financial year results obtained by the
investee company after the date of acquisition. In their result from the financial year, the investor
recognises the portion of the results of the investee company corresponding to them. Distributions
received from the investee company reduce the book value of the investment. It may be necessary to
make adjustments to include alterations to the stake in the investee company as a result of changes
in another global result of the investee company.

Any variations experienced during the financial year in the net equity following elimination of the
proportion based on results generated in transactions with Group companies, and not involving third
parties, increase or reduce, as applicable, the book value of the holding in question to the
corresponding proportion, following consideration of any amortisations and impairments occurring
since the method was applied for the first time.

Profits distributed by the Group included in the consolidated annual report under the equity method
reduce the book value of the holding.

A homogenisation of values and over time is applied to associated investments in the same way as
for subsidiaries.

The information referring to the investment in the Associated companies which are consolidated
under the equity method are the following:

_c) Joint Ventures (JVs)_
The balance sheets and the profit and loss accounts of these companies have been consolidated
proportionally in the consolidated financial statement and in the consolidated income statement as of
31 December 2015.

The group recognises the proportional part corresponding to it of assets controlled jointly and
liabilities incurred jointly in accordance with the percentage stake, along with assets attached to joint
operations which are under control and liabilities incurred as a result of joint business.


-----

Similarly, the consolidated statement of results recognises the part corresponding to income
generated and expenses incurred by the joint business. Additionally, the costs incurred with regard to
the stake in the joint business are also recorded.

Non-realised results deriving from reciprocal transactions are eliminated in proportion to the stake, in
addition to the sums of reciprocal assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and cash flows.

- During 2015, the proportional integration method has been used to consolidate Ute Torrellobeta,
Ute Valls, Ute Palma, Ute Devas 1 and Ute Devas 2.

_d) Joint businesses_
The group’s stake in gains or losses subsequent to the acquisition of joint businesses is recognised in
the consolidated statement of results; its stake in transactions subsequent to the acquisition is
recognised in reserves. Accumulated transactions subsequent to the acquisition are adjusted against
the book value of the investment. When the Group’s stake in the losses of a joint business is equal
to, or greater than the value of the stake therein, including unsecured accounts receivable, the Group
recognises losses up to the maximum amount that would correspond to them based on their
percentage stake in the equity deficit, minus tacit gains of the assets of the company in question.

Any unrealised gains from transactions between the Group and its joint businesses are eliminated as
a function of the Group’s percentage stake in these. Any unrealised losses are also eliminated,
unless the transaction provides evidence of a loss due to impairment of the asset being transferred.
When necessary to ensure uniformity with policies adopted by the group, the accounting policies of
joint businesses are amended.

Those joint businesses with a 50% stake, but which maintain effective control of their management
because they directly or indirectly hold over 50% of voting rights due to the existence of agreements
with other shareholders, are accounted for using the overall integration method.

**_2.9 Main valuation standards applied in preparing the consolidated financial situation statement_**
**_and the consolidated statement of results._**

_2.9.1 Intangible assets_
Intangible fixed assets are initially valued at their cost, whether the price of acquisition or the cost of
production. The cost of intangible fixed assets acquired by means of the combination of businesses is
stated as the fair value on the date of acquisition.

Following initial recognition, the intangible fixed assets are valued at their cost, less the cumulative
amortisation and, where applicable, the cumulative sum of recorded valuation corrections for
impairment.

a) Concessions
Concessions essentially includes the fees paid on certain concessions for the operation of car parks.

These administrative concessions are listed in the assets at their cost, less the cumulative
amortisation and the cumulative sum of acknowledged valuation corrections for impairment.

Concessions also include access rights paid by means of a concession fee during the period of the
concession. In this case the concessions are included under the assets at the current value of the
minimum agreed payments, without taking into consideration contingent payments.

The concessions are amortised on a linear basis over the period of the concession.

b) Computer applications
Licences acquired for computer programs from third parties are capitalised on the basis of the costs
incurred in acquiring them and preparing the specific program for use.

The Company amortises its computer software on a linear basis, distributing the cost of the assets
over the estimated useful life of the same, which is three years.


-----

The costs connected with the development or maintenance of computer programs are recognised as
an expense when they are incurred. The costs directly connected with the production of individual,
identifiable computer programs produced by the Group, provided that it is considered probable that
they will generate economic benefits greater than the costs for more than one year, are recognised
as intangible fixed assets. Direct costs include the cost of the personnel developing the computer
programs and an appropriate percentage of general costs.

_2.9.2 Tangible fixed assets_
Tangible asset elements are recognised at their cost of acquisition, with the addition of the costs
incurred up until their operational start-up, less the cumulative amortisation and the cumulative sum
of recognised losses.

The costs of the extension, modernisation or improvement of tangible fixed assets are incorporated
within the asset as an increase in its value only if they represent an increase in its capacity,
productivity or an extension to its useful life, and wherever it is possible to calculate or estimate the
book value of the elements cancelled from the inventory having been replaced.

The removal or disposal of any items is reflected in the accounts by eliminating the cost there of and
the corresponding cumulative amortisation.

The costs of major repairs to assets belonging to the group are activated and amortised during the
useful life thereof, whereas recurring maintenance costs are charged to the statement of results
during the financial year in which they are incurred.

The amortisation of tangible fixed assets, except for land, which is not amortised, is calculated in
accordance with the values of the updated cost, following the linear method based on the estimated
useful life, in accordance with the depreciation actually suffered through operation, usage and
enjoyment. The estimated useful lifespans are:

**Estimated useful life**

Buildings and other construction ........................................................................................................  50
Machinery, installations and tools.......................................................................................................  10
Furniture and fittings...........................................................................................................................  10
Transport elements.............................................................................................................................   6
Other fixed assets...............................................................................................................................   3

The car parks which are part of the property, plant and equipment (in the caption “Buildings”) are
valued at the acquisition price or at the production cost, depreciated on a straight-line basis over the
life of the concession.

Where the book value of an asset is greater than its estimated recoverable value, its value is reduced
immediately down to the recoverable sum.

The income and expenses from selling tangible fixed assets are calculated by comparing the amount
obtained by the sale with the book value and are recorded in the income statement in the
“Impairment and result through disposal of fixed assets” caption.

The residual value and the useful life of the assets are reviewed, with adjustments made if necessary
at the close of each balance sheet.

At least at the close of the financial year, the need to perform valuation corrections based on
impairment in value is analysed

_2.9.3 Impairment losses_
In the case of goodwill, the group carries out annual value impairment tests. In the case of
depreciable assets, at each account close the Group assesses the existence of any loss in value that
forces it to reduce the carrying amount. If any loss indication is present, the recoverable value of the
asset is calculated in order to identify the scope of the loss by impairment in case its recoverable
value is lower than its book value, and its effect is recorded in the income statement. Impairment
losses must be assessed for each individual asset. If this is not possible, the impairment loss is


-----

determined for the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash flows independent of
flows from other assets (cashgenerating units).

The recoverable amount is the higher of the market value (arms length value less associated costs)
and the value in use. The usage value is calculated from estimated future cash flows, discounted at a
rate that reflects the present market value, taking into account the value of money and specific risks
associated with the asset.

_2.9.4 Interest costs_
Financial expenses directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of fixed asset elements
requiring a period of time longer than one year in order to be fit for use are included in the cost until
such time as the asset is in operational condition.

_2.9.5 Financial assets_

a) Loans and items receivable:

Loans and items receivable are non-derivative financial assets with sums receivable which are fixed
or can be established and are not listed on an active market. These are included under current
assets, except those with a maturity date beyond twelve months from the date of the consolidated
financial statement, which are classified as non-current assets. Loans and items receivable are
included under “Corporate loans” and “Trade and other receivables” on the consolidated balance
sheet.

These are financial assets are initially valued at their fair value, and subsequently in accordance with
their amortised cost based on the effective rate of interest. Transaction costs directly attributable to
their acquisition are recognised in the statement of results. On a quarterly basis, the necessary
valuation corrections based on impairment in value are applied, if there is any evidence that the
entire sums owed will not be collected. The sum of the value impairment loss is the difference
between the book value of the asset and the value of the estimated future cash flows, discounted at
the effective rate of interest at the time of initial recognition. Any value corrections, as well as their
reversal, if applicable, are recognised on the consolidated statement of results.

The recognition and reversal of valuation corrections through the impairment of client accounts
receivable have been included under “Provisions and losses of amounts payable that cannot be
collected” in the consolidated statement of results.

The sums charged to the impairment account are normally cancelled once there is no expectation of
more cash being recovered.

The maximum exposure to credit risk on the date of submission of the information is the fair value of
each of the aforementioned categories of accounts receivable. The group maintains no guarantee as
insurance.

b) Investments in group, multi-group and associate companies:

They are valued at their cost less, where applicable, the cumulative value of value impairment
corrections. However, where there is an investment made prior to the classification of a company as
a Group, Multi-group or Associated company, the cost of the investment is assumed to be its book
value prior to such classification. Prior valuation adjustments entered into the accounts directly under
the net equity are maintained there until cancellation.

Investments in the assets of group and associated companies are included in the accounting records,
under both current assets and non-current.

The current assets include short-term investment in group and associated companies, comprising
corporate loans and other financial assets.

The non-current assets record the balance of long-term investments on group and associated
companies, comprising asset instruments. Asset instruments are broken down in the balances of
holdings in group companies, holdings in associated companies and share disbursements pending
and not called on.


-----

If there exists objective evidence that the book value is unrecoverable, the relevant valuation
correction is applied as the difference between the book value and the recoverable sum, the latter
understood as whichever is the greater of the fair value less the costs of sale and the current value of
the future cash flows derived from the investment.

_2.9.6 Financial derivatives at fair value_
Derivatives are initially identified by their fair market value as of the contract date. The subsequent
changes in market value are recorded as well on each balance closing date. The method of
identifying the profit and losses will depend on if the instrument is designated as hedging or not and if
it is, on the type of hedging. The different types of hedging designated by the Group are the following:

i. Cash flow hedge: Its purpose is to hedge the exposure to highly probable future transactions and
variations in cash flow. The gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recorded by the non-efficient
section of the consolidated statement of results, while the efficient part is identified directly under
net equity of the consolidated financial situation statement. The amount deferred in net equity is
not recognised in the consolidated statement of results until the gains or losses of hedged
transactions are registered in the results, or until the maturity date of transactions. This recognition
is carried out the same way as the results of the hedge item.

In the case of derivatives that do not qualify as hedge items, changes in reasonable value are
recorded on the consolidated statement of results.

_2.9.7 Business Combinations and Goodwill_
The business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition cost method, which entails
recognizing the fair value of the assets and liabilities identified in the acquired business. Goodwill is
the positive difference between the cost of an investment and the value of the aforementioned assets
and liabilities. In the acquisitions of associated companies, the goodwill that is generated is
considered as greater value of the share. Consolidated goodwill does not depreciate and is subject to
the impairment test. (See note 6).

Goodwill is assigned to cash generating units for the purpose of performing impairment loss tests.
This allocation is made to those cash generating units expected to benefit from the merger of
businesses during which the goodwill arose.

_2.9.8 Stock_
Stock is valued at its cost or its net realisable value, whichever is the lower. The cost of stock is
established by application of the weighted average cost principle.

The cost of the finished products and products in progress correspond to construction in progress
and completed, and include the costs incurred in construction of car parking destined to concession
of usage.

Parking spaces intended for sale and included in stock are valued at the price of acquisition or the
cost of production.

If the cost is greater than the market value, the relevant valuation corrections are applied, and are
recognised as an expense in the profit and loss account. If the circumstances leading to the value
correction cease to exist, the sum of the correction is subject to reversion and is recognised as
revenue in the consolidated income statement.

_2.9.9 Cash and other equivalent liquid assets_
Cash and other equivalent liquid assets include cash on hand, demand deposits at banks, and short
term, high liquid investments which initially have a maturity of three months or less and are not
subject to a significant risk of changes in value.

This section includes the short term restricted cash flow. This concept collects the investments of the
same nature and maturity affected by financing of specific infrastructure projects, whose availability is
restricted by financing contracts as guarantee to cover specific short term obligations relative to
interests or principle of the debt as well as for the future maintenance of the infrastructure.


-----

_2.9.10 Net equity_
Ordinary shares are classified as net equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new
shares are presented in net equity as a deduction, net of taxes. The purchasing of Parent Company
shares by consideration paid, including attributed associated costs, are deducted from the net equity.
When these shares are sold or subsequently reissued, any amount received net of costs includes the
net equity.

The basic profit by action is calculated as the quotient between the net profits attributed to the parent
company and the average weighted number of ordinary shares in circulation during said period. In
turn, the diluted profit by action is calculated as the quotient between the net results of the period
attributed to the ordinary shareholders and the average weighted number of ordinary shares in
circulation during said period.

In the case of the Group’s consolidated annual accounts corresponding to financial years ending
31 December 2015 and 2014, the basic earnings per share coincide with diluted earnings per share.

_2.9.11 Provisions for employees_

a) Pension commitments:

Fixed provision pension plans

Pension plans which are not classified as fixed contribution plans are deemed as fixed provision
arrangements. In general, fixed provision plans establish the sum of the provision to be received by
the employee at the time of retirement, normally in accordance with one or more factors, such as
age, years of service and remuneration.

The Group recognises in its balance sheet a provision for fixed provision pension plans based on the
difference between the current value of the committed remunerations and the fair value of any
possible assets subject to commitments which are to be used to settle the obligations, with any
appropriate deduction being made in accordance with the sum of the costs of past services not yet
recognised.

If the above difference gives rise to an asset, the value placed on this may not be greater than the
current value of the provisions which may be returned to the Group in the form of direct
reimbursements or reduced future contributions plus, where applicable, the part pending allocation to
results through costs for past services. Any adjustment which the Group may be required to make on
the basis of this limit in the valuation of the assets is attributed directly to the net equity, being
recognised as reserves.

The current value of the obligation is established by means of actuarial calculation methods and
financial and actuarial hypotheses which are unbiased and mutually compatible.

Any variation in calculation of the current value of the committed remunerations or, as applicable, the
corresponding assets, at the date of close, as a result of actuarial profits and losses, is recognised in
the financial year during which it arises, recorded directly in the net equity as reserves. For these
purposes, profits and losses cover only variations arising through changes in actuarial hypotheses or
adjustments based on experience.

Costs of past services are recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement, except in
the case of revocable rights, in which case they are attributed to the consolidated income statement
on a linear basis over the remaining period up until the rights based on past services become
irrevocable. However, if an asset is derived, the revocable rights are attributed to the income
statement immediately, unless a reduction occurs in the current value of the provisions which may be
returned to the Group in the form of direct reimbursement or reduced future contributions, in which
case the excess above this reduction is attributed immediately to the consolidated income statement.

As of 31 December 2015, there are no people to whom group companies have retirement
commitments.


-----

b) Redundancy compensation:

Redundancy compensation is paid to employees as a result of a decision by the Group to terminate
their employment contracts prior to the normal retirement age, or if the employee agrees to retire
voluntarily in exchange for such provisions. The Group recognises these provisions when a proven
commitment has been agreed for the termination of the employment of workers, in accordance with a
detailed, formal plan, with no possible withdrawal, or an agreement has been reached to provide
redundancy compensation as a result of an offer made in order to encourage voluntary redundancies.
Those provisions which are not to be paid within 12 months of the date of the balance sheet are
discounted at their current value.

_2.9.12 Transactions among related parties_
In general, operations among related parties are accounted for at the initial point at their fair value. In
any case, if the agreed price differs from the fair value, the difference is recorded in accordance with
the economic reality of the operation. The subsequent valuation is made in accordance with the terms
set out in the corresponding regulations.

_2.9.13 Subsidies_
A subsidy is considered not refundable when there is an individual concession agreement for the
subsidy, all the conditions for its concession have been met and there are no reasonable doubts that
payment will be collected.

The monetary type subsidies are valued using the fair value of the awarded amount.

_2.9.14 Provisions and contingent liabilities_
Provisions for contingencies and expenses are accounted for in accordance with the estimated
amount required to deal with probable or certain responsibilities, arising from legal proceedings in
progress and for compensation and pending obligations of an undetermined amount, guarantees or
other similar sureties.

Provisions are recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present obligation, either legal
or implicit, as a result of past events, where it is deemed probable that this will involve the need for
outgoing resources for settlement, and the sum can be estimated in a reliable manner.

Provisions are valued at the current value of the disbursements which are expected to be required in
order to settle the obligation, using a pre-tax rate which reflects the opinions of the current market as
to the temporary value of money and the specific risks of the obligation. Adjustments in the provision
based on any updates are recognised as a financial expense as they gradually accrue.

Provisions maturing within one year or less and with an insignificant financial impact are not
discounted. Contingent liabilities are possible obligations arising as a result of past events, the
materialisation of which depends on whether or not one or more future events should occur, outside
the control of the Group.

Given the activities in which the Group is currently engaged, it has no liabilities, expenses, assets or
provisions and contingencies of an environmental nature which could prove significant with reference
to its net equity, its financial situation and its results. Hence, specific breakdowns are not included in
the report herein on the consolidated annual accounts with regards information on environmental
issues.

Costs derived from the protection and improvements of the environment are attributed to the
consolidated results for the financial year in which they are incurred, irrespective of the point when
the monetary or financial flow derived from them occurs.

When such expenses involve the acquisition of property, plant and equipment the purpose of which is
to minimise environmental impact and to protect and improve the environment, these are included in
the accounts as an increase in the value of fixed assets.


-----

_2.9.15 Financial liabilities_

Debts and items payable

These liabilities are initially carried at the fair net value of the expenses incurred in the transaction,
subsequently recording these by their amortised cost according to the effective interest method. The
effective interest rate is the discount rate equal to the expected flow of future payments foreseeable
up until maturity of the liability. In the case that the effective interest rate is initially considered
different from the market interest, the liability is valued taking into account the actual value of the
future flows at that market rate in the case of loans with set interest rates. If said interest rate is not
fulfilled, the valuation of these is also carried out at the aforementioned market interest rate.

In the event of a renegotiation of existing debts, it is considered that no substantial modification has
occurred to the financial liability if the lender of the new loan is the same as that which granted the
initial loan and the current value of the cash flows, including the associated issuance and execution
costs using the effective interest method, varies by no more than 10% from the current value of the
cash flows pending payment on the original liability, calculated in accordance with this same method.

_2.9.16 Corporation tax and deferred taxes_
The Group has since 1 January 2005 paid taxes under the consolidated taxation system at Cintra
Concesiones de Infraestructuras de Transporte, S.A., as a result of the change in ownership which
occurred in 2004, following which the Dominant Company fell within the aforementioned tax
consolidation perimeter. The group previously paid taxes under the consolidated taxation system as
part of the Ferrovial, S.A. Group. During 2009, as a result of the sale transaction referred, the Group
left the aforementioned tax system, and on 31 December 2009 the company applied to pay taxes as
a tax group, with effect from 1 January 2010. This group comprises the following companies:

- Empark, Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A.

- Dornier, S.A.U.

- Femet, S.A.

- Guadianapark, S.A.

- Balsol 2001, S.A.

- Estacionamientos Guipuzcoanos, S.A.

- Empark Aparcamientos Andalucía, S.L.

- Maksu España, S.L.

- Car Parking, S.L.U.

- I Mas D Parking, S.L.U.

The cost or revenue erived from profits tax is the sum accrued under this item during the financial
year, covering both the cost or revenue of current tax and deferred tax.

Both the cost (revenue) derived from current and deferred taxes are recorded in the consolidated
income statement. However, the taxation affect connected with items directly recorded in the
consolidated statement of net equity is recognised within the net equity.

Assets or liabilities based on current tax are valued for the sums expected to be paid to or recovered
from the tax authorities, employing the regulations in force or approved and pending publication at the
date of close of the financial year.

Deferred taxes are calculated in accordance with the liability method, based on the temporary
differences arising between the taxable base sums of the assets and their book values. However,
where deferred taxes are the result of the initial recognition of an asset or a liability in a transaction
other than a combination of businesses which, at the time of the transaction, does not affect either
the book result or the calculation base for the tax, they are not recognised. Deferred tax is
established by applying the regulations and taxation rates approved or about to be approved at the


-----

date of the balance sheet, and which are expected to be applied when the corresponding asset
through deferred tax is realised or the deferred tax liability settled.

Assets through deferred taxes are recognised to the extent that it is considered probable that future
taxable profits will be made which could be used to compensate for temporary differences.

Deferred taxes are recognised in accordance with the temporary differences arising in investments in
subsidiaries and associated companies and joint businesses, except in those cases where the
Company can control the time of reversion of the temporary differences, and it is likewise probable
that these will not revert in the foreseeable future.

The term “consolidated corporation taxes” includes all taxes, national and foreign, related to profits
subject to tax. The consolidated corporation tax also includes other taxes such as taxes that
encumber the repatriation of results as well as any other tax that uses the accounted income as a
basis for calculations.

The corporation tax expense reflected in the consolidated financial statements is calculated by
aggregating the expense registered for each company that belongs to the consolidated group,
increased or decreased, as appropriate, by elimination of accounting consolidation adjustments and
by the differences arising between the taxable base sums of the assets and liabilities and their book
values in the consolidated annual reports (balance sheet method).

Deferred taxes are not recognized when the transaction has no effect on the accounting and/or fiscal
value of the involved assets or liabilities. In the case of business combinations, the corresponding
deferred taxes derived from the price assigning process and the fiscal amortisation of the generated
goodwill in each case.

The assets and liabilities through deferred taxes are calculated at current taxation rates. At the date
of the consolidated income statement and which are foreseen to be applicable during the period in
which the asset is realised or the liability is settled. They are debited or credited to the income
statement except when they refer to items that are directly recorded as net equity, in which case, they
are accounted for as debit or credit to said accounts. By non-distributed profit of the subsidiaries,
there is no liability by deferred taxes when the Group can control the reversion of the temporary
differences and it is not probable that these will be reverted in a foreseeable future. The assets
through deferred taxes and the tax credits derived from negative tax base sums are identified when it
is probable that the Group may recover these in the future regardless of the time in which they are
recovered and always when the recovery is prior to the legal period for usage. The assets and
liabilities through deferred taxes are not deducted and are classified as a non-current asset (liability)
in the balance sheet. At each year-end, the recognised Assets through deferred taxes are reviewed.

_2.9.17 Conversion of foreign currency transactions_
The annual accounts of companies in foreign currency have been converted to euros using the
closing exchange rate method in accordance with the following rates:

**31/12/2015     31/12/2015     31/12/2014     31/12/2014**

**Exchange Rate                             average          close        average          close**

**euro/pound ...............................................    0.7258       0.7340       0.8061       0.7789**
**euro/Turkish lira** ........................................    3.0255       3.1765       2.9065       2.8320

_2.9.18 Recognition of revenue_
Revenue and expenses are attributed in accordance with the accrual principle, in other words based
on when the true value of the goods and services they represent becomes current, irrespective of
when the monetary or financial value arising from them is realised.

Revenue is recorded at the fair value of the consideration to be received and represents the sums
receivable for goods delivered and services provided within the ordinary course of the Group’s
activities, less returns, rebates, discounts and VAT.

The Group recognises revenue when the sum thereof can reliably be valued, it is probable that future
economic benefits will be received by the Group and specific conditions are met for each of the


-----

activities, as detailed below. The sum of revenue is not deemed to be subject to reliable valuation
until all contingencies connected with the sale have been resolved. The Group bases its estimate on
historical results, taking into consideration the type of client, the type of transaction and the specific
terms of each agreement.

a) It is worth making the following distinctions within the car park business:

a.1) Off-street and mixed parking

a.2) On-street parking (ORA)

a.3) Car parks for local residents

a.1) Off-street and mixed parking

Off-street car park revenues are recorded when the hourly parking rate is paid and, in the case of
season ticket-holders, on an accrual basis. Mixed car parks (with public and private spaces) record
revenues as follows: in the case of public spaces, in the manner described in the preceding
paragraph; and in case of private spaces, the amount received is recorded in the income statement
at the time of the transfer of concession usage of the corresponding parking spaces.

Regarding the public spaces, these are recorded in inventories and are transcribed to the income
statement on the date of the transfer of the concession of usage.

a.2) On-street parking (ORA)

Revenue from the ORA on-street car parks meter service is mainly based on the sum corresponding
to the cost of providing the service plus a percentage, generally between 1% and 3%, of the surplus
between that cost and the funds collected. In some ORA on-street car parks contracts, revenue is
obtained as a fixed percentage of the take, to be paid by the Local Council. This is recorded in the
accounts at the time when the service is provided.

a.3) Car parks for local residents

This business involves the construction of car parks whose spaces are sold directly to the end
customer during the time frame of the concession. The sales and costs are not recorded until the
parking space is delivered, which tends to coincide with the signature of the contract, or exceptionally,
the public deed of sale.

_2.9.19 Leases_

a) When one of the Group’s companies is the lessee – Financial leasing

The Group leases certain tangible fixed assets. Leases of tangible fixed assets where the Group
substantially retains the risks and benefits derived from ownership are classified as financial leases.
Financial leases are capitalised at the commencement of the lease at the fair value of the property
leased, or the current value of the minimum payments agreed under the lease, whichever is the
lower. The calculation of current value is based on the implicit interest rate of the contract, and if this
cannot be established, the Group interest rate for similar operations.

Each lease payment is distributed between the liability and financial charges. The total financial
charge is distributed over the course of the lease and attributed to the consolidated statement of the
financial year when it accrues, applying the effective interest rate method. Contingent payments are
recorded as a cost for the financial year when incurred. The corresponding lease obligations, net of
financial charges, are included in “Other items payable”. Fixed assets acquired under a financial
lease system depreciate during their useful life or the duration of the contract, whichever is the lesser.

b) When one of the Group’s companies is the lessee – Operational leasing

Leases where the lessor retains a substantial part of the risks and benefits derived from ownership
are classified as operational leases. Payments under operational leases (net of any incentive
received from the lesser) are charged to the consolidated statement of the financial year when they
accrue, on a linear basis over the period of the lease.


-----

c) When the group is the lessor

Where assets are leased under a financial lease arrangement, the current value of lease payments,
discounted at the implicit interest rate of the contract, is recognised as an item receivable. The
difference between the gross sum to be received and the current value of this sum, corresponding to
interest not accrued, is attributed to the consolidated statement of the financial year when that
interest accrues, in accordance with the effective interest rate method.

Where assets are leased under an operational lease arrangement, the asset is included in the
consolidated statement of the financial statement sheet in accordance with its nature. Revenue
derived from the lease is recognised in a linear manner over the course of the lease period.

_2.9.20 Redundancy compensation_
In accordance with current legislation, the Company is obliged to pay compensation to those
employees who, under certain circumstances, have their employment contracts terminated.
Redundancy compensation payments which can reasonably be quantified are recorded as an
expense in the financial year in which a valid expectation exists, created by the Company with regard
to the third parties affected.

_2.9.21 Comparison of information_
In accordance with current legislation, along with each item of the Consolidated Financial Situation
Statement, Consolidated Income Statement, Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income,
Consolidated Statement of Changes to Net Equity and Consolidated Cash Flows Statement, as well
as figures corresponding to the financial year ending 31 December 2015, the items corresponding to
the financial year ending 31 December 2014, as well as the Consolidated Financial Situation
Statements at 01 January 2014, are submitted.

**3 Management of financial and currency risks**
The Group’s activities are exposed to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including exchange rate
risk, interest rate risk and price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.

Risk management is controlled by the Senior Economic and Financial Management of Empark
Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A., which identifies, evaluates and covers financial risks in accordance
with the policies approved by the Board of Directors. The Administrative Board provides policies for
overall risk management, and also for specific areas, such as exchange rate risk, interest rate risk,
liquidity risk, and use of derivative and non-derivative instruments and the investment of surplus
liquidity.

The financial risks to which the Company is exposed include those derived from the guarantees and
bonds required in order for the company to undertake its activities.

During the 2015 and 2014 financial years, the Company had in place bank guarantees with third
parties and guarantee commitments with other Group companies in order to engage in its business.
(See note 38).

**_Market Risk: Exchange rate risk_**
Management has established an exchange rate risk management policy for foreign currencies other
than the operating currency. Forward contracts, negotiated by the finance department, are used to
manage exchange rate risks arising from future trade transactions and recognised assets and
liabilities. Exchange rate risk arises where future commercial transactions or recognised assets or
liabilities are quoted in a currency other than the organisation’s operating currency.

The Group has no significant exchange rate risk, as most of its assets and liabilities, revenue and
expenses, are expressed in euros. Companies that, due to their origin (United Kingdom and Turkey),
use the currency of their country of origin, also express their assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses
in that currency.


-----

**_Market Risk: Exchange rate risk from cash flows and fair value_**
As of 31 December 2015, if the interest rates on outside resources quoted in euros had been
50 basis points higher/lower, with all other variables remaining constant, the result after taxes for the
period would have been (1,063)/1,063 thousands of euros lower/higher, mainly as a result of an
increase/decrease in the cost of interest on variable-rate loans.

The Group carries out the corresponding interest rate hedges by contracting an IRS (Interest Rate
Swap). (See note 23).

Interest rate risk occurs as a result of possible losses caused by variations in the fair value or future
cash flows of a financial instrument as a result of changes in market interest rates. The Group’s
exposure to the risk of changes in interests rates mainly arises from variable interest rate credits and
loans.

Out of the 457,660 thousands of euros of long term debt in 2015 (465,984 of debt minus
8,324 thousands of euros of amortised cost), only 189,094 thousands of euros are influenced by the
Euribor. In 2014, the amount of long term debt held is 465,449 thousands of euros (475,626 of debt
minus 10,178 thousands of euros of amortised cost), and the amount influenced by interest rates is
195,490 thousands of euros.

Below can be found details of net non-current funding classified based on interest rate structure:

**Thousands of euros**

**457,660       465,449**

Variable interest rate funding is Euribor-linked.

The Company has no need to contract long term debt with the December 2013 bond issue

**_Credit risk_**
Credit risk is handled by groups. Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, financial
derivative instruments and deposits held in banks and financial institutions, along with wholesale and
retail clients, including pending accounts receivable and committed transactions. Regarding banks
and financial institutions, only financial institutions that are known to be reputable and solvent will be
accepted.

Credit risk occurs as a result of the possible loss caused by a breach of contractual obligations by the
Company’s counterparts, in other words the possibility of not recovering financial assets at the value
accounted for and within the established deadlines.

Maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 December is as follows:

**Thousands of euros**

basis for managing their collection. Debt with an age in excess of 1 year is reviewed on an annual
basis and a monthly insolvency provision is allocated.

**Total (note 9a)..........................................................      1,025     32,462      1,087     31,884**

**_Liquidity risk_**
Prudent management of liquidity risk involves holding sufficient cash and transferable securities,
having access to finance through a sufficient sum of agreed credit facilities and having the capacity to
unwind market positions. Given the dynamic nature of underlying businesses, the aim of the Group’s
treasury department is to maintain funding availability by ensuring that lines of credit are available.

Liquidity risk occurs as a result of the possibility that the Company may not have access to liquid
funds of a sufficient quantity and at an appropriate cost in order at all times to meet its payment
obligations.

Through the company Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A., at all times the group has
guaranteed its liquidity requirements through lines of credit with financial entities worth a total amount
of 4,700 thousands of euros, as well as a revolving credit facility with a limit of 30,000 thousands of
euros. As of 31 December 2015, there was no available balance with the RCF or with any lines of
credit.

**_Capital Management_**
The Group manages capital such that a debt ratio that gives financial stability to the group is
maintained; it seeks investments with optimal profitability rates for the purpose of generating greater
solidity and profitability for the Group.

As can be seen on the balance sheet, most of the debt is long term. These ratios reflect the fact that
prudent criteria are used for capital management, as expected cash flows over coming years, along
with the group’s equity situation, will service the debt.

**4 Intangible assets**

**31/12/2015**
Fundamentally, concessions include the cost of construction or acquisition of operating rights of
different establishments, as well as initial fees paid for certain car park operation concessions.


-----

These administrative concessions are listed in the assets at their cost, less the cumulative
amortisation and the cumulative sum of acknowledged valuation corrections for impairment.

Concessions also include access rights paid by means of a concession fee during the period of the
concession. In this case the concessions are included under the assets at the current value of the
minimum agreed payments, without taking into consideration contingent payments.

**144,684       145,177**

**_Impairment tests_**
The Group undertakes an annual procedure in order to identify any possible deficit in the registered
cost with regard to the recoverable value of goodwill.

In the case of the goodwill of Empark Aparcamiento y Servicios S.A., Dornier S.A.U., Balsol 2001,
S.A., Car Parking, S.L.U. and Empark Portugal-Empreendimentos e Exploraçao de Parqueamentos
S.A., this procedure is performed by analysing the assets available to the company at the time of its
acquisition and which gave rise to the recognised goodwill, these being individual car parks.

Any possible impairment is calculated by comparing the value of these assets with their fair value, the
latter understood as the value of the future cash flow discounts which it is estimated that the assets
will generate, based on objective hypotheses, discounted at an estimated capital cost based on a
risk-free rate using the 30-year bond as a benchmark, and the level of risk of the asset, along with an
estimated market premium.

A residual value is furthermore calculated, incorporating the renewal of the contract and growth.

In order to establish the current value of future cash flows derived from the investment, the following
hypotheses have been followed:

- It has been determined that the corresponding investment will generate cash flows with terms up to
maturity; this period is between 5 and 50 years, depending on the concession.

- The corresponding revenue and expenditure forecasts were performed, in accordance with the
following general criteria:

  - In the case of revenue, in order to estimate the evolution of rates consideration was given to the
estimated evolution of the consumer price index (CPI) in each of the countries where the
investments are operational (2% in both Spain and Portugal), the corresponding formulae for the
adjustment of rates as set out in the concession contracts, on the basis of the evolution of price
indices and/or any specific correction factors which may apply.

Ramp up during the first 2-5 years of the concession has been taken into account in the case of
new contracts, depending on the specific analysis of each contract; subsequently, an evolution
in revenue similar to previous revenue has been estimated.

  - In terms of expenditure, the evolution thereof was calculated on the basis of the envisaged
evolution of corresponding CPI rates (2% in both Spain and Portugal), as well as on the planned
evolution of the activity.

  - Consideration is also given to the cost of works to be performed in order to keep infrastructure in
perfect usage conditions, based on the best estimate available according to the company’s
experience, and taking into consideration the forecast evolution of the business.

 - Future revenue and costs corresponding to contract renewals have been considered, as well as
any investments necessary to carry out these renewals, based on investments made in previous
contracts.


-----

Renewal percentages used for the different lines of businesses (off-street, ORA and
management) have been estimated at between 75% and 85%, based on real rates obtained by
the group.

  - The forecast cash flows obtained on the basis of the projected revenue and expenditure, in
accordance with the aforementioned criteria, were updated at the discount rate resulting from
adding to the long-term cost of money the risk premium assigned by the market to the country
where the Group performs its operations, the risk premium assigned by the market to each
business (both based on a long-term vision), along with the financial structure of the company or
cash-generating unit in question. The discount rate employed was 6.75%.

As a result of the impairment test performed, it has been revealed that the various cash-generating
units to which the various recorded sums of goodwill are assigned will serve to recover the net value
of each of the sums recorded by 31 December 2015, and there is therefore no need to establish any
form of impairment provision.

Similarly, sensitivity analyses have been performed on reasonably possible changes to the main
valuation variables (CPI, inflation, discount rate, renewals) and the recoverable value remain above
the net accounting value.

The Group contracts derivative financial instruments (interest rate swaps) with various parties, mainly
financial institutions with suitable investment grades, to protect itself from interest rate fluctuations in
its bank loans. These derivatives meet the conditions to be designated as accounting hedge
instruments (cash flow hedges), so any changes to their fair value are temporarily allocated to net
equity. Valuation techniques with observable market data have been used for their valuation. The
most frequently applied evaluation techniques include future price models, using calculations of the
current value of expected cash flows. Models take a range of data into account, including credit
ratings and interest rate curves. Changes to credit risk have not had a material effect on the
effectiveness of the hedge or on the valuation of derivatives designated as such.

On 18 November 2011, Empark Aparcamientos Andalucía, S.L., took out a loan with La Caixa
amounting to 7,000 thousands of euros. This loan is hedged with the same entity for 6,300 thousands

interest rate (Euribor). As of 31 December 2015 the Company had recorded the valuation of this
product, net of the taxation affect, for a sum of 1,873 thousands of euros.

The valuation of the derivatives owned by the Group as of 31 December 2015 and 2014 is (4,594)
thousands of euros and (5,417) thousands of euros respectively. (See note 19).

The Group classifies fair value valuations using a hierarchy that reflects the relevance of the variables
employed in the valuations, as per the following levels:

a) non-adjusted quoted prices on active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1).

b) variables other than the quoted prices included in Level 1, which can be observed for the asset or
liability, either directly (that is, as prices), or indirectly (that is, derived from prices) (Level 2), and

c) variables, used for the asset or liability, that are not based on observable market date
(unobservable variables) (Level 3).

The only Group assets or liabilities valued at fair value are these derivatives (interest swaps), found
in category b) of the previous breakdown (Level 2).

_1 – Revenue generated by off-street car parks_
Revenue from off-street car parks corresponds to revenues generated through the use of parking
spaces owned by the Group or held under an administrative concession. Off-street car park revenues
are recorded when the hourly parking rate is paid and, in the case of season ticket-holders, on an
accrual basis.

_2 – Revenue generated through the sale of residents' parking spaces_
This business involves the construction of car parks whose spaces are sold directly to the end
customer during the time frame of the concession. The sales and costs are not recorded until the
parking space is delivered, which coincides with the signature of the contract.

_3 – Revenue generated by on-street parking (ORA)_
Revenue from the ORA on-street car parks meter service is mainly based on the sum corresponding
to the cost of providing the service plus a percentage, generally between 1% and 3%, of the surplus
between that cost and the funds collected. On some ORA on-street car parks contracts, the revenue
is earned at a fixed rate (service cost), entirely irrespective of the funds collected, which are in all
cases paid over to the Local Council. This is recorded in the accounts at the time when the service is
provided.

_4 – Revenue generated by other services._
The Group also specialises in the provision of other services tied to the end-to-end management of
car parking and urban and inter-urban mobility, such as: Management of control of access to nature
reserves, provision of temporary parking services at trade fairs and mass attendance events,
combined park and bus services around airports.

As for the Company’s financial risk management policy, this is based on the Group managing its
capital in order to guarantee that it will be in a position to continue operating as a profitable business,
while maximising shareholder return by striking an optimum balance between debt and shareholders
equity.

Below are set out the main risks to which the Group is exposed:

- Liquidity risk: The Group establishes its treasury needs as part of its general policy through the use
of two tools: Treasury budget with a 12-month horizon, providing monthly detail and updates, and
treasury budget with a 30-day horizon, with daily updates and details. These tools identify treasury
needs in volume and time, and make plans for new financing needs.

- Credit risk: The Group maintains cash and equivalent liquid assets at financial institutions with a
high-level credit rating. It should furthermore be mentioned that there is no significant concentration
of credit risk with third parties.

- Interest rate risk: Interest-rate risk affects the Group essentially through long-term outside
resources. The Group has contracted financial instruments that partially cover the risk of possible
interest rate hikes.

- Exchange rate risk The Group has no significant exchange rate risk, as most of its assets and
liabilities, revenue and expenses, are quoted in euros.

**Subsequent events**
In January 2016 Empark Portugal – Empreendimentos e Exploraçao de Parqueamentos, S.A,
acquired 100% of the shares of the trading company EMSA, which holds 50% of the shares of
the company ParqueGil – Planemento e Gestao de Estacionamento, S.A. As a result, Empark
Portugal – Empreendimentos e Exploraçao de Parqueamentos, S.A, is the sole shareholder with
100 % of the shares of the company ParqueGil – Planemento e Gestao de Estacionamento, S.A.

**Research and development**
The Group has implemented research and development activities related to the technology
implemented in different contracts.


-----

**Treasury stock**
There have been no acquisitions of treasury stock.

**Derivatives**
The Group has contracted financial instruments that partially cover the risk of possible interest rate
hikes of long-term outside resources.

**Environmental aspects**
Environmental activities are understood as covering any operation the main purpose of which is to
prevent, reduce or repair damage to the environment.

The investments derived from environmental activities are valued at the acquisition cost and are
activated as greater fixed asset expenses in the financial year in which they are incurred, following
the criteria described in note 2 regarding applicable accounting standards.

Costs derived from the protection and improvement of the environment are attributed to the results for
the financial year in which they are incurred, irrespective of the point when the monetary or financial
flow derived therefrom occurs.

The provisions relative to probable or certain responsibilities, legal proceedings in process and for
compensation and pending obligations of an undetermined amount, of an environmental nature not
covered by contracted insurance policies, are made when the liability or the obligation establishing
the compensation becomes effective.

As of 31 December 2015, the costs or expenses incurred with regard to environmental aspects are
insignificant.

As for any such potential contingencies as may arise in the field of the environment, the directors do
not believe that they would have any significant impact on the enclosed annual accounts.
