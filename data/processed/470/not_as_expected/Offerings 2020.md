# Notice to Certain European investors

## European Economic Area

In relation to each Member State of the EEA (as defined below) (each, a ‘‘Member State’’), each
Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed, severally and not jointly, that it has not offered,
sold or otherwise made available and will not offer, sell or otherwise make available any Notes
to any retail investor in the EEA. For the purposes of this provision the expression ‘‘retail
_investor’’ means a person who is one (or more) of the following:_

(i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II (as defined below); or

(ii) a customer within the meaning of the Insurance Distribution Directive (as defined below)
where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of
Article 4(1) of MiFID II.

**_MIFID II Product Governance / Professional Investors and Eligible Counterparties_**
Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market
assessment in respect of any of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market
for the Notes is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in
Directive 2014/65/EU as amended (‘‘MiFID II’’) and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes
to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently
offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a ‘‘distributor’’) should take into consideration
the target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for
undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or
refining the target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**_PRIIPs Regulation / Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors_**
The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not
be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic
Area (‘‘EEA’’). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a
retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (ii) a customer within the
meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as amended, the ‘‘Insurance Distribution Directive’’), where
that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1)
of MiFID II. Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No
1286/2014 (as amended, the ‘‘PRIIPs Regulation’’) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise
making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering
or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may
be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation. This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on

v


-----

the basis that any offer of the Notes in any Member State will be made pursuant to an
exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for
offers of the Notes. This Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the
Prospectus Regulation.

Each prospective purchaser of the Notes must comply with all applicable laws and rules and
regulations in force in any jurisdiction in which it purchases, offers or sells the Notes and must
obtain any consent, approval or permission required by it for the purchase, offer or sale by it
of the Notes under the laws and regulations in force in any jurisdiction to which it is subject or
in which it makes such purchases, offers or sales, and neither we nor the Initial Purchasers shall
have any responsibility therefor.

## UK

This Offering Memorandum is for distribution only to, and is directed solely at, persons who
(i) are outside the UK, (ii) are investment professionals, as such term is defined in Article 19(5)
of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005, as amended
(the ‘‘Financial Promotion Order’’), (iii) are persons falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) of the
Financial Promotion Order, or (iv) are persons to whom an invitation or inducement to engage
in investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets
Act 2000, in connection with the issue or sale of any Notes may otherwise be lawfully
communicated or caused to be communicated (all such persons together being referred to as
‘‘relevant persons’’). This Offering Memorandum is directed only at relevant persons and must
not be acted on or relied on by persons who are not relevant persons. Any investment or

which will not result in an offer of securities to the public in the UK within the meaning of
Part VI of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000.

## Spain

The Notes may not be listed, offered or sold in Spain other than by institutions authorized
under the restated text of the Spanish Securities Market Law approved by Royal Legislative
Decree 4/2015, of October 23, as amended (Real Decreto Legislativo 4/2015, de 23 de octubre,
_por el que se aprueba el texto refundido de la Ley del Mercado de Valores) (the ‘‘Securities_
_Market Law’’), and Royal Decree 217/2008 of February 15, as amended on the Legal Regime_
Applicable to Investment Services Companies (Real Decreto 217/2008, de 15 de febrero, sobre el
_R´egimen Jur´ıdico de las empresas de servicios de inversi´on y de las dem´as entidades que_
_prestan servicios de inversi´on), to provide investment services in Spain, and in compliance with_
the provisions of the Securities Market Law and any other applicable legislation. The Notes may
not be offered, sold or distributed, nor may any subsequent resale of the Notes be carried out
in Spain, except in circumstances which do not require the registration of a prospectus in Spain,
or without complying with all legal and regulatory requirements under Spanish securities laws.
Neither the Notes nor this Offering Memorandum have been or will be registered with the
Spanish Securities Market Commission (Comisi´on Nacional del Mercado de Valores) and
therefore this Offering Memorandum is not intended for any public offer of the Notes in
Spain.

## Portugal

Neither the Offering nor this offering memorandum have been registered with the Portuguese
Securities Market Commission (Comiss˜ao do Mercado de Valores Mobili´arios) and no action has

vi

been or will be taken that would permit a public offering of any of the Notes in Portugal.
Accordingly, no Notes may be offered, sold or distributed except in circumstances that will
result in compliance with any applicable laws and regulations, in particular with articles 109,
110, 110-B and 111 of the Portuguese Securities Code (C´odigo dos Valores Mobili´arios).

to, the Luxembourg financial sector regulator (Commission de surveillance du secteur financier)

indirectly, and neither this offering memorandum nor any other circular, prospectus, form of

Exchange Ltd. and corresponding prospectus schemes annexed to the listing rules of the SIX
Swiss Exchange Ltd or the listing rules of any other Swiss stock exchange or regulated trading

# Market and Industry Data

In this offering memorandum, we rely on and refer to information regarding our business and
the market in which we operate and compete. The market, economic and industry data and
forecasts used in this offering memorandum were obtained from governmental and other
publicly available sources and independent industry publications and reports, including the EU
Transport in Figures—Statistical Pocketbook 2019, published by the European Commission in
2019, the DBK Report on Iberian Car Market of March 2019 ‘‘Aparcamientos (Mercado Ib´erico)’’
(the ‘‘DBK Report’’). Industry publications and forecasts generally state that the information
they contain has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but that the accuracy and
completeness of such information is not guaranteed. We have not independently verified such
data and cannot guarantee its accuracy or completeness.

In some cases, there may be no readily available external information (whether from trade
associations, government bodies or other organizations) to validate market-related analyses
and estimates, requiring us to rely on our own internally developed estimates regarding the
industry in which we operate, our position in the industry, our market share and the market
shares of various industry participants based on our experience, our own investigation of
market conditions and our review of industry publications, including information made
available to the public by our competitors. Neither we nor the Initial Purchasers can assure you
of the accuracy and completeness of, and take no responsibility for, such data. Similarly, while
we believe our internal estimates to be reasonable, these estimates have not been verified by
any independent sources and neither we nor the Initial Purchasers can assure you as to their
accuracy or the accuracy of the underlying assumptions used to estimate such data. Our
estimates involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various factors.

# Presentation of Financial and Other Information

## General

The Issuer was formed as a private limited liability company (soci´et´e `a responsabilit´e limit´ee),
under the laws of Luxembourg on September 26, 2017. The Issuer is a special purpose financing
vehicle formed for the purposes of facilitating the offering of the Existing Notes and any
subsequent offerings, including the Offering, and related financing activities. The Issuer has not
engaged in any activities other than those related to its formation, the offering of the Existing
Notes, the Offering and related financing activities.

The Parent Guarantor was incorporated on June 22, 2017. On July 28, 2017, the Parent
Guarantor agreed to the 100% acquisition of the Empark Group. Consequently, the Group has
been preparing consolidated financial statements at the level of the Parent Guarantor since it
became the Group reporting entity effective June 22, 2017. As a result, the financial
information presented in this offering memorandum is derived from the historical consolidated
financial information of (i) Arena Luxembourg Investments S.`a r.l. (the ‘‘Parent Guarantor’’) and
its subsidiaries (together, the ‘‘Group’’) as of December 31, 2017, as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2018, and as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2019,
and (ii) Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A.U. (‘‘Empark’’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘‘Empark
_Group’’) as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016, and for the year ended_
December 31, 2017.

This offering memorandum contains:

- the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements of the Group as of and
for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 (the ‘‘Interim Group Consolidated Financial
_Statements’’), which have been prepared in accordance with International Accounting_
Standard 34;

- the audited consolidated financial statements of the Group as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2018 (the ‘‘2018 Group Consolidated Financial Statements’’), which have been
prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘‘IFRS’’) and audited
by PricewaterhouseCoopers, Soci´et´e coop´erative;

- the audited consolidated financial statements of the Group as of December 31, 2017 and for
the period from and including June 22, 2017 to December 31, 2017 (the ‘‘2017 Group
_Consolidated Financial Statements’’), which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and_
audited by Ernst & Young S.A.;

- the audited consolidated special purpose financial position, income and cash flow statements
of the Empark Group as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017 (the ‘‘2017 Special
_Purpose Empark Group Consolidated Financial Position, Income and Cashflow Statements’’),_
which have been prepared in accordance with the presentation and measurement bases
described in Note 2 thereof; and

- the audited consolidated financial statements of the Empark Group as of and for the year
ended December 31, 2016 which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and audited by
Ernst & Young S.L., as set forth in their auditor’s report included elsewhere herein (the ‘‘2016
_Empark Group Consolidated Financial Statements’’ and, together with the 2017 Special_
Purpose Empark Group Consolidated Financial Position, Income and Cashflow Statements, the
2017 Group Consolidated Financial Statements and the 2018 Group Consolidated Financial
Statements, the ‘‘Audited Consolidated Financial Statements’’).

## Basis of Preparation

The unaudited financial information for the twelve months ended September 30, 2019,
presented herein, is derived by adding our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial

xiii


-----

information for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 extracted from the Interim Group
Consolidated Financial Statements and our audited consolidated financial information for the
year ended December 31, 2018 extracted from the 2018 Group Consolidated Financial
Statements and subtracting our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial
information for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 extracted from the Interim Group
Consolidated Financial Statements.

The 2017 Special Purpose Empark Group Consolidated Financial Position, Income and Cashflow
Statements are special purpose financial statements of the Empark Group which have been
prepared solely for inclusion in this offering memorandum. They do not include information on
the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the notes thereto and certain other
disclosures, solely disclosing the relevant and necessary notes for an appropriate understanding
of the consolidated special purpose financial position, income and cash flow statement of the
Empark Group as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Effective January 1, 2019 the Group has adopted International Financial Reporting Standard 16
‘‘Leases’’ (‘‘IFRS 16’’) using the modified retrospective method of adoption with the date of
initial application (January 1, 2019). Under this method, the reclassifications and the
adjustments arising from the new lease accounting rules are directly recognized in the opening
balance on January 1, 2019.

## Changes in Reporting Entity

With respect to the consolidated income and cash flow statements, the 2018 Group
Consolidated Financial Statements are not directly comparable with the 2017 Special Purpose
Empark Group Consolidated Financial Position, Income and Cashflow Statements, due to
changes in the reporting entity. The Parent Guarantor is the reporting entity for the Interim
Group Consolidated Financial Statements, the 2018 Group Consolidated Financial Statements
and the 2017 Group Consolidated Financial Statements. Empark is the reporting entity for the
2017 Special Purpose Empark Group Consolidated Financial Position, Income and Cashflow
Statements and the 2016 Empark Group Consolidated Financial Statements. With respect to the
consolidated statements of financial position, the 2018 Group Consolidated Financial
Statements and the 2017 Group Consolidated Financial Statements are not directly comparable
with the 2016 Empark Group Consolidated Financial Statements due to changes in the
reporting entity.

## Pro forma Financial Information

This offering memorandum includes unaudited consolidated pro forma financial information
which shows certain consolidated financial information as adjusted to give pro forma effect to
the Offering and the Redemption on the financial position and net financial expenses of the
Group as of and for the twelve months ended September 30, 2019. The unaudited consolidated
_pro forma financial information has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and does not_
purport to represent what the actual consolidated financial position or net financial expenses
of the Group would have been if the Offering and the Redemption had occurred (i) on
September 30, 2019, for the purposes of the calculation of net financial position and (ii) on
October 1, 2019 for the purposes of the calculation of net financial expenses, nor do they
purport to project the Group’s consolidated financial position and net financial expenses at any
future date. The unaudited pro forma adjustments and the unaudited pro forma financial
information set out in this offering memorandum are not accounting measures within the
scope of IFRS and are based on available information and certain assumptions and estimates
that we believe are reasonable and may differ materially from the actual adjusted amounts.
The primary, unaudited pro forma financial measures that are used in this offering
memorandum include pro forma cash and cash equivalents, pro forma gross debt, pro forma
net debt, pro forma net recourse debt and pro forma cash interest expense. See ‘‘Summary—

_Information.’’_

## Non-IFRS Measures

This Offering Memorandum includes certain financial measures which are not accounting
measures within the scope of IFRS, and may not be permitted to appear on the face of primary
financial statements or footnotes thereto and may not be permitted to be included in filings
under the U.S. Securities Act. The following are the primary non-IFRS financial measures that
are used in this offering memorandum:

- Adjusted EBITDA, which we define as EBITDA adjusted for (i) non-recurring headquarter
operating expenses (including redundancy payments and other related personnel costs),
(ii) non-recurring business unit expenses, and (iii) other ‘‘one off’’ items or non-recurring
gains and losses (including gains and losses realized from the sale of parking spaces to local
residents and gains and losses realized on the sale and acquisition of parking facilities and
equity stakes in new subsidiaries). Starting from January 1, 2019, Adjusted EBITDA includes
the impact of the application of IFRS 16;

- Adjusted EBITDA by business line, which we define as EBITDA for the relevant business line
_adjusted for (i) reallocation of overhead costs and non-recurring headquarter operating_
expenses, (ii) non-recurring business unit expenses (including redundancy payments and other
related personnel costs) and (iii) other ‘‘one-off’’ items or non-recurring gains and losses
(including gains and losses realized from the sale of parking spaces to local residents and
gains and losses realized on the sale and acquisition of parking facilities);

- Adjusted EBITDA Margin, which we define as Adjusted EBITDA divided by Adjusted Revenue;

- Adjusted Revenue, which we define as revenues plus other operating income less other
non-recurring revenues less other ‘‘one off’’ items or non-recurring gains and losses (including
gains and losses realized from the sale of parking spaces to local residents and gains and
losses realized on the sale of parking facilities);

- Capital expenditure, which we define as our payments through investments less our
collections through divestments. We divide our capital expenditure in two categories:
maintenance capital expenditure and expansionary capital expenditure. We define
maintenance capital as capital expenditure that relate to car park contract maintenance
requirements (mainly recurring maintenance works and repairs on car park facilities to ensure
they remain fully operational and compliant) prior to termination of the concessions to
operate such car parks but excludes the initial investment made under such contract.
Expansionary capital expenditure are further divide into: (i) renewal and growth capital
expenditure that relate to on-street investments which are required in concessions near to
their maturity and new contracts added to the portfolio, namely a concession acquisition or
an investment made in newly awarded contracts and (ii) M&A capital expenditure that relate
to new contracts added to the portfolio where we have acquired the share capital of the
company and not the asset itself.

- EBITDA, which we define as operating result excluding amortization and depreciation,
provisions and losses of unrecoverable credits and impairment and result through disposal of
fixed assets. Starting from January 1, 2019, EBITDA includes the impact of the application of
IFRS 16;

- EBITDA Margin, which we define as EBITDA divided by the sum of revenues and other
operating income;

- Free Cash Flow, which we define as Adjusted EBITDA less maintenance capital expenditure,
changes in working capital, cash taxes, non-cash items and non-current items. Non-current
items include one-off costs related to severance payments, advisor costs, one-off contractual

compensations and dividends received. Non-cash items comprise concession fee payments
registered according to International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee 12
‘‘Service Concession Arrangement’’ (‘‘IFRIC 12’’) and IFRS 16;

- Free Cash Flow Conversion, which we define as Free Cash Flow divided by Adjusted EBITDA;

- Gross debt, which we define as the non-current portion of bonds issued, bank borrowings,
leasing and other debt and the current portion of bonds issued and bank borrowings,
including accrued interest and excluding unamortized debt issue costs;

- Gross profit, which we define as Adjusted Revenue less Changes in inventories, Cost of sales,
Payroll, Other operating expenses excluding Other non-recurring changes in inventories,
Other non-recurring personnel costs and Other non-recurring expenses;

- Gross recourse debt, which we define as Gross debt excluding the non-current portion of
bonds issued, bank borrowings, leasing and other debt and the current portion of bonds
issued and bank borrowings of the Non-Recourse Entities;

- Gross non-recourse debt, which we define as the non-current portion of bonds issued, bank
borrowings, leasing and other debt and the current portion of bonds issued and bank
borrowings of the Non-Recourse Entities, including accrued interest and excluding
unamortized debt issue costs;

- Like-for-like revenues, which we define as revenues and other operating income adjusted to
eliminate any new concessions and any concessions that expired or were terminated during
the periods being compared.

- Net debt, which we define as Gross debt less cash and cash equivalents;

- Net recourse debt, which we define as Gross recourse debt less Recourse cash and cash
equivalents;

- Net non-recourse debt, which we define as Gross non-recourse debt less Non-recourse cash
and cash equivalents;

- Pro forma EBITDA, which we define as Adjusted EBITDA adjusted for terminated contracts
and new contracts as well as overheads savings;

- Recourse cash and cash equivalents, which we define as Cash and cash equivalents held by all
members of the Group excluding the Non-Recourse Entities;

- Non-recourse cash and cash equivalents, which we define as Cash and cash equivalents held
by the Non-Recourse Entities;

- Recourse Adjusted EBITDA, which we define as Adjusted EBITDA excluding Adjusted EBITDA
generated by the Non-Recourse Entities;

- Non-recourse Adjusted EBITDA, which we define as Adjusted EBITDA generated by the
Non-Recourse Entities; and

- Weighted Average Remaining Duration of our concessions, which we define as the average
period of time remaining on our concessions and contracts, weighted by the contribution
each concession has made to our Adjusted EBITDA.

See ‘‘Summary—Summary Financial, Operating and Other Information’’ and ‘‘Management’s
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation’’ for further_
information as to the calculation of these non-IFRS financial measures.

The non-IFRS measures presented in this Offering Memorandum may not be comparable to
other similarly titled measures of other companies. The EBITDA measures presented in this
offering memorandum differ from the definition of ‘‘Consolidated EBITDA’’ set forth under the

xvi


-----

caption ‘‘Description of Notes—Certain Definitions.’’ By eliminating potential differences
between periods or companies caused by factors such as depreciation and amortization
methods, financing and capital structures and taxation positions or regimes, we believe these
non-IFRS financial measures can provide a useful additional basis for comparing the current
performance of the underlying operations being evaluated. For these reasons, we believe these
non-IFRS financial measures and similar measures are regularly used by the investment
community as a means of comparing companies in our industry.

Our management also uses the non-IFRS financial measures described above to assess our
operating and financial performance and to make decisions about allocating resources in our
business. For example, management monitors the Weighted Average Remaining Duration for
our concessions in order to evaluate future cash flow variability and any associated risk.

None of the non-IFRS financial measures presented herein are a measurement of performance
under IFRS and they should not be considered in isolation or construed as a substitute for
(a) operating profit or profit for the period as a measure of our operating performance,
(b) cash flow from operating, investment and financing activities as a measure of our ability to
meet our cash needs or (c) any other measures of performance or liquidity.

The non-IFRS financial measures presented herein have limitations as analytical tools, including
the following:

- they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures,
contractual commitments or working capital;

- they do not reflect the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to
service interest or principal payments on our debts;

- although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated
and amortized will often need to be replaced in the future, and the non-IFRS financial
measures do not reflect any cash requirements that would be required for such
replacements;

- some of the exceptional items that we eliminate in calculating the relevant non-IFRS financial
measures reflect cash payments that were made, or will in the future be made;

- other companies in our industry may calculate the non-IFRS financial measures presented
herein differently than we do, which limits their usefulness as a comparative measure; and

- they remove the results of impairments and disposals of fixed assets which may also occur in
future periods.

Certain amounts and percentages included in this offering memorandum have been rounded.
Accordingly, in certain instances, the sum of the numbers in a column of a table may not
exactly equal the total figure for that column.

The financial information included in this offering memorandum is not intended to comply
with the applicable accounting requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and the related rules
and regulations of the SEC which would apply if the Notes were being registered with the SEC.

‘‘U.S.$’’ or ‘‘$’’ are to the lawful currency of the United States of America and references to
‘‘euro’’ or ‘‘e’’ are to the lawful currency of the European Union.

The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the high, low, average and period end
Bloomberg Composite Rate expressed as U.S. dollars per e1.00. We have provided this exchange
rate information solely for your convenience. We do not make any representation that any
amount of currencies specified in the table below has been, or could be, converted into the
applicable currency at the rates indicated or any other rate.

The Bloomberg Composite Rate is a ‘‘best market’’ calculation, in which, at any point in time,
the bid rate is equal to the highest bid rate of all contributing bank indications and the ask
rate is set to the lowest ask rate offered by these banks. The Bloomberg Composite Rate is a
mid-value rate between the applied highest bid rate and the lowest ask rate. The rates may
differ from the actual rates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements
and other financial information appearing in this offering memorandum. None of the Issuer,
the Guarantors or the Initial Purchasers represent that the U.S. dollar amounts referred to
below could be or could have been converted into euro at any particular rate indicated or any
other rate. Our inclusion of the exchange rates is not meant to suggest that the euro amounts
actually represent U.S. dollar amounts or that these amounts could have been converted into
U.S. dollars at any particular rate, if at all.

The average rate for a year means the average of the Bloomberg Composite Rates on the last
business day of each month during a year. The average rate for a month, or for any shorter
period, means the average of the daily Bloomberg Composite Rates during that month, or
shorter period, as the case may be.

## Overview

We are one of the leading concessionaires and operators of parking infrastructure in the
Iberian Peninsula, as measured by number of parking spaces and revenues. We mainly operate
underground car parks (‘‘off-street’’), as well as some parking areas on city streets (‘‘on-street’’)
under concessions and surface rights agreements from public authorities. As of September 30,
2019, our portfolio comprised 403 concession contracts in 145 municipalities, under which we
manage over 436,920 parking spaces, including 33,366 resident spaces, primarily in Spain and
Portugal, and marginally in Andorra, Turkey and the UK. For the twelve months ended
September 30, 2019, our revenues were e197.3 million, our Adjusted Revenue was
e196.4 million, our Adjusted EBITDA was e90.6 million and we had an Adjusted EBITDA Margin
of 46.1%. Our operations in Spain and Portugal, respectively, represented 70.7% and 25.4% of
our Adjusted Revenue, 68.2% and 28.9% of our gross profits and 82.9% and 13.9% of our
parking spaces for the twelve months ended September 30, 2019. Our off-street concession
business and on-street concession business generated 56.5% and 35.5% of our Adjusted
Revenue, respectively, and 83.9% and 16.5% of our Adjusted EBITDA, respectively, for the
twelve months ended September 30, 2019.

We have served the Iberian market since the late 1960s. We believe this has given us a ‘‘first
mover’’ advantage, whereby we have continually secured long-term concessions and built a
portfolio of prime parking locations in Spain and Portugal, including in city centers, airports
and other high density traffic areas, such as hospitals and business districts. Due to a variety of
physical, regulatory and other constraints such as cost of space, we believe that there is limited
opportunity to develop alternative parking options in many of these prime areas, allowing us
to benefit from captive demand with limited competition. Due to an overall lack of available
land in major cities within our geographical focus, and an overall urbanization trend in the
current macroeconomic climate, we do not expect this competitive advantage to diminish in
the foreseeable future.

We generate revenues under three business lines:

- Off-street concessions. Our off-street concession business primarily comprises long-term
concessions, with contract lengths generally ranging from 20 to 50 years, granted by
municipalities to develop and operate parking facilities, primarily underground and multistory, and generated 56.5% of our Adjusted Revenue (e111.0 million) and 83.9% of our
Adjusted EBITDA (e76.0 million), and had an Adjusted EBITDA Margin of 68.5%, for the
twelve months ended September 30, 2019. Under these contracts, we are generally required
to invest in the construction of a new parking facility (a ‘‘green field’’ concession) or make an
upfront payment to the municipality for an existing parking facility (a ‘‘brown field’’
concession). We operate each parking facility on a long-term basis and generate our fees
based on tariffs charged to car park users, as set out in the relevant concession or surface
rights agreement, which typically increase each year in line with inflation. We generally
retain all fees generated from operating the relevant parking facility and are responsible for
all expenses relating to operating and maintaining the parking facility during the term of

1


-----

the concession. With respect to ‘‘brown field’’ concessions, we may pay an annual concession
fee to the municipality, an upfront fee or a combination of both. In addition, we sell a
limited number of parking spaces to local residents, receiving a monthly fee for the
rendering of maintenance services, as an ancillary activity in connection with the
development of some parking facilities. As of September 30, 2019, we had 285 off-street
concession contracts (including 78 resident contracts) under which we manage approximately
120,003 parking spaces. The Weighted Average Remaining Duration of our off-street
concessions was approximately 25 years as of September 30, 2019.

- On-street concessions. Our on-street concession business comprises concessions, with contract
lengths generally ranging from five to 20 years, granted by municipalities to manage metercontrolled on-street parking, and generated 35.5% of our Adjusted Revenue (e69.7 million)
and 16.5% of our Adjusted EBITDA (e15.0 million), and had an Adjusted EBITDA Margin of
21.5%, during the twelve months ended September 30, 2019. For these types of contracts,
we typically receive fixed fees that are inflation-indexed and which cover the yearly
amortized amount of our initial investment and operating costs and reasonable rate of
return. In a number of concessions, the contract also includes a variable incentive element
(which may be based on a percentage of the collected meter receipts, the number of parking
spaces or certain other indicators) to align the concessionaire’s objectives with optimizing
revenue collection. As of September 30, 2019, we had 114 on-street concession contracts
(including seven contracts exclusively dedicated to tow-away services) under which we
manage approximately 230,966 parking spaces. We have a long-standing presence in many
cities and a successful relationship with many municipalities which we believe provides us
with a competitive advantage in securing new off-street business. The Weighted Average
Remaining Duration of our on-street concessions was approximately five years as of
September 30, 2019.

- Off-street contract management. Our off-street contract management business involves
contracts to manage parking facilities on behalf of public authorities, primarily airports, as
well as a limited number of private entities. Our off-street contract management business
generated 8.0% of our Adjusted Revenue (e15.7 million) and did not affect our Adjusted
EBITDA in a meaningful way in the twelve months ended September 30, 2019. As of
September 30, 2019, we had four off-street management contracts. Under these contracts,
we operate and manage parking facilities with approximately 85,951 parking spaces on
behalf of third parties in exchange for a fixed fee. Although it is a relatively small part of
our overall business, our off-street contract management business line allows us to gain
expertise in managing complex operations, as well as to improve our access to municipalities
and build local market knowledge.

## Strengths

We believe that we have several competitive advantages in the car park sector in Iberia,
including our long-term contract revenues, diversified business profile, assets with low demand
risk and market leadership. As a result of these strengths, together with the stable regulatory
environment and favorable industry dynamics, our business benefits from a high level of
stability and recurring cash flows.

**_Uniquely positioned for growth on the back of Iberia’s favorable macroeconomic trends_**
The macroeconomic environment in Spain and Portugal, our largest geographic markets in
terms of revenues, has continued to improve. The car park industry has recently been growing
in Iberia, mainly driven by this factor as well as urbanization and an increase in the number of
cars. The profitability of the sector is generally improving, supported by scale efficiencies, the
implementation of cost savings programs and the utilization of innovative industry technology
(including digitalization), among other factors. See ‘‘Industry.’’ We believe that we are well
positioned to benefit from the continued improvement in the economic environment in Iberia
resulting in organic growth opportunities for us. The economic growth in Iberia may also lead

3


-----

to consolidation opportunities that provide room for further non-organic growth. We believe
that improvements in our business activity and revenues, along with a sustained cost-base, in
connection with such economic improvement, together with our various cost efficiency
initiatives, will have a positive effect on our EBITDA.

During the period from 2016 to 2018, we benefitted from the good macroeconomic landscape
in Iberia and were able to increase our Like-for-like revenues on a CAGR basis at a higher rate
than the CAGR of GDP in Iberia over the same period.

**_Leading car park concessionaire in Iberia benefitting from scale and high barriers to market_**
**_entry_**
We are one of the leading car park concessionaires in the Iberian parking infrastructure
concessions market both by revenue and total number of parking spaces and were the leading
car park operator in Portugal in terms of revenue, and the leading car park operator in Spain
by number of spaces, for the year ended December 31, 2018. As of September 30, 2019, we
managed 362,294 parking spaces in Spain (including 33,366 resident spaces), 60,678 in Portugal,
4,075 in Turkey, 8,500 in the UK and 1,373 in Andorra. We had approximately 25.0 million car
parking transactions in the twelve months ended September 30, 2019, based on the number of
payments made across all our car parks. Our size and growth have allowed us to achieve
significant economies of scale, and the scope of our operations, combined with the various cost
management measures we have implemented, have allowed us to maintain our Adjusted
EBITDA levels. For example, our centralized control room system controls and manages a
substantial majority of our off-street concessions business’ parking facilities from a remote
location, which has allowed us to improve our cash flow and reduce operating expenses,
headcount and personnel costs (we reduced the number of operators per car park by more
than half) without impacting our service quality and customer satisfaction levels. This is a key
driver for efficiency gains and margin improvements, particularly in the off-street segment,
allowing for more competitive pricing when bidding for new contracts and placing us in a
strong position for additional growth. In addition, our mobile maintenance personnel are
responsible for the maintenance of several car parks within a defined geographic area, which
reduces personnel expenses and standby time. This has allowed us to reallocate personnel to
perform certain functions previously outsourced, thereby reducing our reliance on third-party
service providers. Our economies of scale enable us to be a consolidation platform for smaller
Iberian parking operations, and allow us to undertake valuable new concessions and
acquisitions of smaller players. For example, when we acquired Boulevard in August 2019 we
integrated the company into our centralized control room system to reduce the number of
staff on site, ensured maintenance works were performed by dedicated local teams and
arranged for management services relating to human resources, tax or accounting, to be
conducted by centralized management teams. In addition, through our experienced

4


-----

management team and our long-standing reputation in the industry, we have been able to
develop and maintain important relationships with the various municipalities with which we do
business, thereby reducing our dependence on any single local authority or region.

We believe the upfront cost and difficulty in obtaining planning permission to build new high
density car parks in city centers, together with the favorable regulatory regime that applies to
concession agreements in Spain and Portugal as discussed under ‘‘—Stable regulatory
_environment with downside protection’’ below, as well as the scale required to operate car_
parks efficiently present significant barriers to entry in the car park industry. The stringent
regulatory framework governing parking concessions in Iberia reduces the risk of new
competitors entering the market. For example, due to the terms and lengths of concession
contracts (the average weighted life for off-street concessions is approximately 25 years as of
September 30, 2019), competitors can be locked-out of the off-street concessions business for
long periods of time. In addition, our size provides us with the scale required to operate a car
park portfolio efficiently. For example, our scale enables us to share resources among our car
parks including maintenance and supervisory staff, as well as management resources in respect
of accounting, marketing, human resources, insurance and tax matters. The number of our
locations also gives us a commercial advantage as we are able to anticipate customer needs
across multiple locations. In addition, the high initial investment required to produce efficient
IT resources is beyond the reach of smaller competitors. Between January 1, 2016 and
December 31, 2018, we invested an average of e1.5 million per annum in IT resources. Unlike
smaller operators, we can price into our bids the efficiencies that we can generate through our
portfolio, and thus offer more attractive terms to municipalities. Also, as there is a lack of
available land in the major city centers of Iberia, there are limited opportunities to construct
new car parks, and our scale provides us with numerous consolidation and expansion
opportunities, which many smaller competitors are unable to take advantage of.

**_High degree of diversification_**
Our business benefits from a portfolio which is highly diversified in terms of the following:
number of contracts, number of municipality clients and types of parking services we deliver.
We are also diversified through our three business lines, each of which has different risk
profiles and capital requirements, but with similar operational and managerial requirements.
As of September 30, 2019, we had 403 contracts, comprising 285 off-street concession contracts
(including 78 resident contracts), 114 on-street concession contracts (including seven contracts
exclusively dedicated to tow-away services) and 4 off-street management contracts. Our
off-street concession business line is further diversified in terms of location, municipality, end
user and type of contract (business district, hospitals, shopping areas and tourism). We believe
our limited reliance on any single contract is a significant factor in diversifying our source of
revenues and therefore reduces our cash flow volatility. While our ten largest off-street car
parks represented 20.2% of our total gross profit for the twelve months ended September 30,
2019, our largest car park represented less than 2.7% of our total gross profit during the same
period. We believe our diversified business portfolio differentiates us from other infrastructure
companies, who typically rely on a smaller number of larger contracts or concessions, with a
greater concentration of risk. We are highly selective as to our management contracts and we
only provide such services to the extent that they comply with certain margin and profitability
criteria.

**_Strategically located assets with attractive concessions and limited demand risk_**
We believe that our infrastructure portfolio is well invested. Our on-street concession and
off-street contract management businesses have low demand risk because we are generally
paid a fixed fee for the services we provide, regardless of occupancy of the car park. Although
our off-street concession business is subject to demand risk and fluctuations in volumes, we
believe the prime locations of our concessions will continue attracting car park users and
ensuring stable utilization levels given our car parks are located in high traffic areas at or

5


-----

within close proximity to city centers. Our business was created as a result of the acquisition of
the two historical leaders in the parking concessions market in Spain and Portugal, each with
prime concessions already in place. As a result, we were able to construct car parks in strategic
locations, including Playa de la Concha in San Sebasti´an and Cam ˜oes in Lisbon, and take
advantage of the existing concessions which were located within close proximity to city centers
and in high traffic areas. Therefore, we believe that we enjoy a prime position in the relevant
local area with respect to a significant proportion of our parking facilities. Moreover, the high
density of city centers together with planning regulations make the approval process for
‘‘green field’’ concessions difficult, effectively limiting the supply of parking spaces in a given
area. Additionally, many of our concessions in strategic locations have a long remaining life,
such as Cam ˜oes, Lisbon (32 years, 340 car park spaces), Playa de la Concha, San Sebasti´an
(39 years, 655 rotation spaces plus 619 resident spaces), Joan de Borb ´o, Barcelona (20 years,
617 rotation spaces plus 14 resident spaces), Restauradores, Lisbon (28 years, 545 car park
spaces) and Boulevard, San Sebasti´an (27 years, 381 rotation car park spaces and 630 resident
spaces), in each case as of September 30, 2019. The prime positions of our car parks and the
difficulty in building new car parks helps to reduce the demand risk in our off-street concession
business.

**_Stable regulatory environment with downside protection_**
The regulatory framework governing off-street and on-street parking concessions in Spain and
Portugal affords certain protections to the concessionaire. We and other car park
concessionaires that operate in Iberia have historically benefitted from a ‘‘rebalancing’’ clause
under the relevant concession legislation in Spain and Portugal, which may also apply to
Portuguese public surface rights agreements. Under certain circumstances, a change in the
balance of the economic terms and conditions of the concession that is adverse to the
concessionaire will trigger a right of the concessionaire to seek compensation or a
‘‘rebalancing’’ mechanism, which typically results in either an extension of the concession
period, an increase in tariffs payable by users, or sometimes an increase in the number of
parking spaces managed by the concessionaire, depending on the circumstances. This
regulatory environment has proven to be stable and predictable since the implementation of
the concession system more than 50 years ago and in the past, we have been successful in
relying on such protective legislation to seek additional compensation. Additionally, the
municipalities granting concessions have an interest in the success of public car parks since they
are a source of income for the municipality and the operation of car parks satisfies a public
need.

**_Highly stable business with limited maintenance capital expenditure requirements_**
For the twelve months ended September 30, 2019, 83.9% of our Adjusted EBITDA was
generated by our off-street concessions business, which had a Weighted Average Remaining
Duration of approximately 25 years. Between January 1, 2016 and September 30, 2019, we
have achieved a consistently high Replacement Rate across the business of 121%, including a
Replacement Rate our off-street concessions of approximately 189%. Our off-street concessions
business also benefits from regulated tariffs linked to inflation. Accordingly, we benefit from a
high level of recurring business and long-term visibility of cash flows, and we believe the longterm nature of our portfolio is matched by few other infrastructure companies in Spain and
Portugal. The most significant contracts in the off-street portfolio are public concession
agreements, with none or limited rent payments, which is not the case of a typical lease
contract more common in other European countries.

For the twelve months ended September 30, 2019, 16.5% of our Adjusted EBITDA was
generated by our on-street concessions business. We have achieved a Replacement Rate of
approximately 73% between January 1, 2016 and September 30, 2019, with respect to our
on-street concessions business. In addition, we also won a number of our competitors’ contracts
and, in some instances, we have successfully renewed our on-street concessions business despite

6


-----

our competitors submitting more competitively priced bids than us. We believe this is due to
our superior technical competence, including the implementation of state of the art revenue
collection technology, and our wealth of industry experience.

Despite the decrease in demand and volumes within our parking facilities that we experienced
during the prior economic downturn, we were able to mitigate some of the effects through
inflation-indexed price tariffs under the majority of our off-street and on-street concessions
business and off-street contract management agreements, as well as growth in our concession
portfolio and our implementation of cost management measures. The stability of our business
and the resilience of our Adjusted EBITDA during the economic downturn are illustrated in the
chart below.

Off-Street On-Street Contract Management

18JAN202002564626

Our business model shares all the key features of infrastructure companies, such as long-term
cash flow visibility, resilient revenue generation, long-term concessions and a favorable and
stable regulatory environment with certain protections for the concessionaire in case of
regulatory or administrative change. However, unlike some other infrastructure companies
(including those operating toll roads), our car parks, once operational, require relatively low
levels of maintenance capital expenditure. Our limited maintenance capital expenditures are a
result of our scale and preventive maintenance measures and low operating intensity. Our
average maintenance capital expenditure during the years ended December 31, 2016 to 2018
was approximately e2.2 million per annum and mainly related to the requirements of our car
park contracts, including recurring maintenance works and repairs on our car park facilities to
ensure that they remain fully operational and compliant. As a result, we believe we are
well-positioned to benefit from returns on these investments. We expect to adjust our capital
expenditure plan to ensure that our technology systems are up-to-date with new technological
developments.

We benefit from attractive working capital dynamics with low levels of credit risk with respect
to our off-street concession business, since such revenues are collected from users when they
exit the car park. Our current business does not require significant investment in working
capital. For example, our off-street concessions business line generates negative working capital
because our revenues are generally collected when earned and our costs are paid according to
standard payment terms as agreed in each of our contracts. However, our on-street and
contract management businesses have higher working capital requirements as they are more
dependent on the payment terms from contracts with public bodies. In addition, our credit risk
with respect to our on-street concessions business is primarily with the municipalities rather
than private third parties. As a result of our low maintenance capital expenditures and working
capital requirements, we have achieved significant Free Cash Flow Conversion ratios of 63.9%
and 83.1% for the year ended December 31, 2018 and the twelve months ended September 30,
2019, respectively.

Any larger capital expenditures are primarily related to the expansion of our business,
including new acquisitions and grants of new contracts and concessions. We are constantly
securing new contracts and concessions as existing contracts and concessions expire. These are

7


-----

based on our analysis of investment opportunities and are typically not linked to prior
commitments. Capital expenditures linked to the expansion of the business depend upon
specific requirements from newly awarded contracts. Additional capital expenditures may be
required in connection with the renewal of on-street contracts nearing their maturity date. Our
limited maintenance capital expenditure requirements are illustrated for the years ended
December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, by the
chart below:

(1) Maintenance capital expenditure mainly relates to car park contract maintenance requirements (mainly recurring
maintenance works and repairs on car park facilities to ensure they remain fully operational and compliant) prior to
termination of the concessions to operate such car parks but excludes the initial investment made under such contract.

(2) Renewal and growth capital expenditure relates to on-street investments which are required in concessions near to their
maturity and new contracts added to the portfolio, namely a concession acquisition or an investment made in newly awarded
contracts.

(3) M&A capital expenditure relates to new contracts added to the portfolio where we have acquired the share capital of the
company and not the asset itself.

As a result of our strong margins, low maintenance capital expenditures and working capital

**_Experienced management team with strong, supportive shareholders_**
Our senior management team has significant experience and understanding of the car park
sector and has an average of 13 years of experience in the industry and 9 years of experience
with the Group. Our senior management team has consistently over performed on budget
targets, through the successful integration of our businesses and significant cost savings
achievements. This over performance can also be attributed to the senior management team’s
ability to anticipate and embrace new trends and technology in the car park sector, which has

8


-----

enabled us to be a pioneer in the deployment of efficient improvement programs and
user-friendly applications, such as electronic payment devices, license plate recognition systems
and mobile applications.

In addition, our senior management team maintains strong and long-standing local
relationships with the relevant regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate.

We also continue to derive benefit from the experience and financial support of the Macquarie
Group which, through its MIRA division, is the world’s largest infrastructure manager by assets
under management (according to Infrastructure Investor 50 (November 2018)). The Macquarie
Group is a global leader in the creation and management of specialist funds which focus on
infrastructure, real estate and adjacent sectors. As of September 30, 2019, MIRA had more than
e124 billion of assets under management with over 800 employees across 38 offices. MIRA has
been investing in Europe for over 20 years with infrastructure portfolio companies located in
Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Netherlands, Italy,
Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden and the UK.

## Strategy

Our key strategies are the following:

**_Maintain focus on growing revenue and improving EBITDA and cash flows_**
We will continue to implement measures designed to increase our revenues and thus enhance
our EBITDA and cash flows. Generally, under our concession agreements, we are subject to
limitations with respect to the maximum tariff that we can charge users of our parking
facilities. As a result, we have the flexibility to structure our pricing policy as we deem fit so
long as we do not exceed the maximum tariffs set forth in the concession agreement. Our
pricing policy varies on a case by case basis, and we may use any or all of the following pricing
mechanics in order to maximize demand and volumes: (i) season tickets, whereby we can offer
a range of different products to fit our customers’ specific needs (for example, offering specific
time slots on specific days or for specific periods of time), which can help to increase volumes
during those times of the day when rotation is less intensive, as well as have a positive impact
on our working capital as a result of receiving payments in advance, (ii) different tariff
structures, whereby tariffs will differ, for example, based on the time of day or the day of the
week, and (iii) long-dated sales, whereby we can expand our product and service offering by
developing special offers and promotions designed in partnership with third parties, such as
travel agencies in connection with holiday packages or special events.

We also seek to increase revenue and volumes within our off-street concessions business
parking facilities through increased deployment of car park signage and other forms of
advertising in city centers and other high traffic areas in which our car parks are located. In
addition, we anticipate that revenues from our large parking facilities opened in the past three
years will increase over the coming years as they are currently in the ‘‘ramp up’’ phase. Within
our on-street concession business, we seek to continue improving our revenue collection
through the implementation of best practices, such as our integrated platform for payment
(Telpark) and visual car enforcement in order to increase revenues collected for the relevant
municipality, which will thereby increase the level of variable incentive compensation we
receive under such concession. Moreover, we intend to continue to implement technological
improvements to achieve greater efficiency, which will allow us to more efficiently manage the
parking areas covered by our on-street concessions business and increase the number of
parking spaces covered per employee. For example, we plan on increasing the number of car
parks, both from our existing portfolio and new acquisitions that will be connected to our
centralized control room in order to reduce fixed costs.

9


-----

**_Maintain our disciplined and high operational efficiency_**
We will continue to focus on managing our business in a cost-efficient manner by using the
latest industry technologies and improving customer service. We will also continue to work
with car manufacturers to implement new technology systems. In the past, we have invested in
and installed several user-friendly IT applications to enhance the customer experience at our car
parks including electronic payment devices such as Via Verde, license plate recognition systems
and mobile applications, such as Telpark, for both off-street and on-street car parking. We plan
to continue to improve and extend the application of our cost-effective practices, such as
monthly contract-by- contract cost base reviews, the centralization of the daily management of
our off-street concessions business car parks from a remote location, our energy efficiency
programs and our on-street efficiency programs. Furthermore, we will continue to maintain our
well invested assets in order to keep our required level of maintenance capital expenditure
low, and we plan to eliminate certain overhead costs not required for continued operations.

**_Preserve and selectively expand our high quality portfolio of long-term concessions_**
We have a diversified portfolio of concessions and contracts in prime locations and will strive
to maintain and renew these concessions and contracts in order to maintain our stable cash
flow generation. We believe our infrastructure is well-invested. Our expansionary capital
expenditure is dependent on the opportunities available to us across our diversified portfolio.
Our total expansionary capital expenditure for the period from 2016 to 2018 was e83.1 million,
representing 13.5% of our total Adjusted Revenue for the same period (e35.1 million and
17.5% for the year ended December 31, 2016, e22.8 million and 11.0% for the year ended
December 31, 2017 and e25.2 million and 12.1% for the year ended December 31, 2018). As a
result, we intend to focus our efforts on renewing our portfolio of existing concessions and
contracts by maintaining our well invested assets in anticipation of future renewal capital
expenditure requirements and organically expanding our operations by capturing new
concessions and contracts. For example, due to our market leading position, scale and
expertise, we believe that we are well positioned to continue to grow our diversified portfolio
by renewing our existing contracts and concessions and capturing new contracts and
concessions from both existing customers seeking to award new concessions and from other
organizations looking to outsource the management of their parking facilities. For example, in
line with our historical strategy, we may acquire high quality smaller car parks in prime
locations and to incorporate them into our centralized control room, which will increase our
portfolio of assets that benefit from our mobile maintenance personnel. Due to our scale,
long-standing experience in this industry and established relationships with municipalities, we
are able to achieve significant synergies that also allow us to offer more competitive terms
than those offered by our competitors. We believe our position as one of the leading
concessionaires of off-street concessions and on-street concessions parking in Iberia, combined
with our long-standing relationships with a diverse number of local authorities and favorable
industry dynamics, including high barriers to entry, will assist us in continuing to implement
this strategy.

**_Strategic focus on off-street concessions business in Iberia_**
We will continue to focus on managing our core business segments within Iberia, principally
the off-street segment. We may opportunistically consider dispositions of non-core operations
and geographies, in order to enhance the risk profile of investment capital expenditures and
improve profitability. In addition, as part of our long-term strategy, we may consider strategic
options regarding the on-street concession business line, off-street contract management and
business outside of Iberia in order to fully focus on our off-street concession business, which
has a higher EBITDA Margin.

During the first nine months of 2019 we completed several acquisitions, such as the remaining
70% equity interest in Figueira Parques, an on-street concessionaire with eight years of
remaining life as of September 30, 2019, the Boulevard car park in San Sebasti´an with an

10


-----

average remaining life of 27 years as of September 30, 2019, and the Can Quit´eria car park in
San Cugat del Vall´es (where we already operate other assets, providing sufficient room for
yield management opportunities). On January 10, 2019, we completed the disposal of our
French business for a total consideration of e0.9 million. On September 5, 2018, we completed
the disposal of our UK business (other than our contract at Edinburgh Airport, which was
retained but which is expected to be terminated on January 31, 2020) to National Car Parks
Limited for a total consideration of e3.9 million. Both disposals demonstrate our continuing
commitment to reinforcing our portfolio of core assets in the Iberian off-street space.

We may also pursue ‘‘bolt-on’’ or strategic acquisition opportunities as and when value
accretive opportunities arise. We would expect to explore opportunities within our existing
core business and geographical footprint, being the off-street segment within the Iberia
region. We would also expect such opportunities to be capable of generating synergies with
our existing operations, growth opportunities where we can leverage our operating capabilities
and skill set, and/or achieve tax synergies, to create value.

Since September 30, 2019, we have completed three further bolt-on acquisitions, namely a
freehold car park in Almer´ıa, a 15-year agreement to operate one car park in Marbella and a
car park in the city center of Le ´on for a period of more than 50 years.

## History and Ownership

We commenced our operations in Iberia under the name Cintra Parking (the name of Empark
prior to its acquisition of Emparque) in Spain in the 1960s. Emparque commenced operations in
Portugal in the 1970s. Over the last five decades, our business has expanded through a
combination of organic growth and a series of mergers and acquisitions. The growth
culminated in July 2009, when the Group was created following a series of transactions
whereby Cintra Parking acquired and merged with Emparque. Since then, we have expanded
our operations with a sustained focus on Iberia.

On December 19, 2017, we were acquired by the Sponsor, a long-term investor providing
significant financial and operational backing to our business and projects, through the
Sponsor’s investment vehicle, Midco.

## Principal Shareholder

The Issuer is indirectly owned, through Midco, by the Sponsor, which is managed by MIRAEL, a
member of the Macquarie Group which, through its MIRA division, is the world’s largest
infrastructure manager by assets under management (according to IPE Real Estate). The
Macquarie Group is a global leader in the creation and management of specialist funds which
focus on infrastructure, real estate and adjacent sectors. As of September 30, 2019, MIRA had
more than e124 billion of assets under management with over 800 employees across 38 offices.
MIRA has been investing in Europe for over 20 year, with infrastructure portfolio companies
located in Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany,
Netherlands, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden and the UK.

## Use of Proceeds

We estimate that the gross proceeds from the Offering will be e575.0 million. The gross
proceeds from the Offering along with cash on the balance sheet will be used (i) to fund the
Redemption, (ii) to pay a distribution to the shareholders of the Parent Guarantor through a
partial repayment of the Subordinated Shareholder Loan and (iii) to pay the fees, commissions
and expenses incurred in connection with the Offering and the Redemption.

The expected estimated sources and uses of the funds necessary to consummate the
transactions described above are shown in the table below as if they had occurred as at
September 30, 2019. Actual amounts may vary from estimated amounts depending on several

11


-----

factors, including differences from our estimate of existing cash in the business, our estimates
of the cost of repaying the existing indebtedness described below, differences from our
estimates of fees, expenses and commissions and the ultimate timing of the Redemption Date.
For descriptions of our current and anticipated indebtedness following the Offering and the
use of proceeds therefrom, see ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements.’’ See also

## The Issuer

The Issuer was incorporated as a private liability company (soci´et´e `a responsabilit´e limit´ee) on
September 26, 2017 under the name ‘‘Arena Luxembourg Finance S.`a r.l.’’ under the laws of the
Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and is registered with the Luxembourg Register of Commerce and
Companies under number B218297. Its registered office is located at 15, Boulevard F.W.
Raiffeisen, L-2411 Luxembourg, Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. The Issuer is a special purpose
financing vehicle formed for the purposes of facilitating the offering of the Existing Notes and
any subsequent offerings, including the Offering, and related financing activities. The Issuer has
not engaged in any activities other than those related to its formation, the offering of the
Existing Notes, the Offering and related financing activities.

## Recent Developments

**_Preliminary trading update_**
Based on preliminary management accounts for November 2019, we estimate that our Adjusted
EBITDA experienced growth for the 11-month period ended November 30, 2019, of
approximately 11% compared to the same period in 2018. This growth is in line with the trend
observed during the nine months ended September 30, 2019. During the same period our
off-street like-for-like revenues experienced growth in the range of 4.0% compared to the
same period in 2018. Since September 2015, we have experienced consistent, positive growth in
our off-street like-for-like revenues with the volume of transactions returning to the levels that
existed prior to the economic downturn in Iberia.

We use like-for-like revenues to provide a comparison between all revenues and other
operating income generated under our off-street and on-street concession business lines during
a specified month in the current year and all revenues and other operating income generated
under our off-street and on-street concession business lines during the same month for the
prior year, as adjusted to eliminate any new concessions and any concessions that expired or

12


-----

were terminated during the periods being compared. Accordingly, if an off-street or on-street
concession was being managed in 2018, but was no longer managed in 2019, the revenues and
other operating income generated under that concession is not included for purposes of this
comparison.

The preliminary financial results discussed above are based on unaudited internal monthly
management accounts and are not intended to be a comprehensive statement of the
consolidated financial or operational results of the Group for any period or for the year ended
December 31, 2019. This information has been prepared by, and is the responsibility of,
management of the Group. The independent auditors have not audited, reviewed, compiled or
performed any procedures with respect to the accompanying preliminary financial results for
the purpose of their inclusion herein. The preliminary financial results set out above are based
on a number of assumptions that are subject to inherent uncertainties and subject to change.
While we believe these assumptions to be reasonable, our actual results for such period may
vary from the preliminary financial results presented above, and these variations could be
material. Although we believe that the preliminary financial information discussed above may
provide investors with a helpful estimate of our results of operations since September 30, 2019,
the preliminary financial results discussed above may not be indicative of results for the three
months ended December 31, 2019, as a number of period-end adjustments have not been
performed for such internal monthly management accounts. Further, our actual results for our
first reporting period following the issuance of the Notes may differ materially from the trends
included herein and may not be indicative of our future results. Such actual results remain
subject to our normal review process. As such, you should not place undue reliance on the
inclusion of the preliminary financial results in this document, it should not be regarded as an
indication or representation that such preliminary financial results will be an accurate
prediction of future events, and such information should not be relied on as such. See
‘‘Forward-Looking Statements,’’ ‘‘Risk Factors’’ and ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations’’ for a more complete discussion of certain of the_
factors that could affect our future performance and results of operations.

**_Distribution_**
On or about the Issue Date, the Parent Guarantor intends to make a distribution to its
shareholders in an amount equal to approximately e92.1 million through a partial repayment
of the Subordinated Shareholder Loan. See ‘‘Use of Proceeds’’ and ‘‘Related Party Transactions.’’

**_Redemption_**
On January 21, 2020, we intend to submit a notice of conditional redemption to the trustee of
the Existing Notes, notifying it of our election to redeem (i) ten percent of the Existing Fixed
Rate Notes at 103% plus accrued and unpaid interest and (ii) the Existing Floating Rate Notes
at 100% plus accrued and unpaid interest, in each case in accordance with the terms of the
indenture for the Existing Notes. We intend to submit a notice of conditional redemption on
January 22, 2020 to the trustee of the Existing Notes, notifying it of our election to redeem the
remaining ninety percent of the Existing Fixed Rate Notes at 100% plus the Applicable
Premium (as defined in the indenture for the Existing Notes) and accrued and unpaid interest
in accordance with the terms of the indenture for the Existing Notes. See ‘‘Use of Proceeds.’’

**_Other developments_**
Since September 30, 2019, we have completed three further bolt-on acquisitions, namely a
freehold car park in Almer´ıa, a 15-year agreement to operate one car park in Marbella and a
car park in the city center of Le ´on for a period of more than 50 years.

The Guarantors generated 83.7% and 85.6% of the
Group’s Adjusted Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA,
respectively, during the twelve months ended
September 30, 2019, and held 90.2% of the Group’s total
assets (and 87.9% of the Group’s tangible and intangible
assets, excluding goodwill) as of September 30, 2019 in
each case excluding our non-wholly owned subsidiaries
and our Non-Recourse Entities. During the twelve months
ended September 30, 2019, our non-wholly owned
subsidiaries and our Non-Recourse Entities, collectively,
generated 18.4% of Adjusted Revenue and 14.4% of
Adjusted EBITDA, and held 11.7% of total assets (and
12.3% of tangible and intangible assets, excluding
goodwill) as of September 30, 2019. During the twelve
months ended September 30, 2019, the non-Guarantor
subsidiaries generated 16.3% of our Adjusted Revenue
and 14.4% of our Adjusted EBITDA, and held 9.8% of our
total assets (and 12.1% of our tangible and intangible
assets, excluding goodwill) as of September 30, 2019. As
of September 30, 2019, after giving pro forma effect to
the issuance of the Notes and the Redemption, the

(from Project Finance Facilities) in the amount of e53.6
million (excluding accrued interest and amortized costs),
primarily comprising Project Finance Facilities. See
‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements.’’ The
Note Guarantees will be subject to release under certain
circumstances. See ‘‘Description of Notes—Guarantors’’
and ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes—There are
_circumstances other than the repayment or discharge of_
_the Notes under which the Collateral will be released_
_automatically, without your consent or the consent of the_
_Trustee.’’_

**Ranking of the Note Guarantees . .** Each Note Guarantee of each Guarantor:

                   - will be a senior obligation of such Guarantor, secured
by (i) the Issue Date Collateral on the Issue Date and
(ii) the Post-Closing Collateral within 60 days of the
Issue Date, as set forth below under the caption
‘‘Description of Notes—Security;’’

                   - will rank pari passu in right of payment with any
existing and future Indebtedness of that Guarantor
that is not subordinated in right of payment to the
Note Guarantee of that Guarantor;

                   - will rank senior in right of payment with any existing
and any future Indebtedness of such Guarantor that is
subordinated in right of payment to the relevant Note;

                   - will be effectively subordinated in right of payment to
any existing or future Indebtedness of such Guarantor
that is secured by property and assets that do not
secure such Note Guarantee, to the extent of the value
of the property and assets securing such Indebtedness;
and

19


-----

                   - will be structurally subordinated to any existing and
future Indebtedness of such Guarantor’s Subsidiaries
that are not Guarantors, including the Project Finance
Facilities.

**Collateral . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** On the Issue Date, the Notes and the Note Guarantees
will be secured on a first-ranking basis by (a) a pledge
over all of the issued shares in the Parent Guarantor;
(b) a pledge over all of the issued shares in the Issuer;
(c) a pledge over bank accounts of the Parent Guarantor;
(d) a pledge over intercompany loan agreements
between Arena Ventures and the Parent Guarantor; and
(e) a pledge over bank accounts of the Issuer (collectively,
the ‘‘Issue Date Collateral’’). Within 60 days of the Issue
Date, the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be secured
on a first-ranking basis by: (a) a pledge over all of the
issued shares in Midco; (b) a pledge over bank accounts
of Midco; (c) a pledge over intercompany loan
agreements between the Parent Guarantor and Midco;
(d) a pledge over intercompany loan agreements made to
Midco (including the Proceeds Loans); (e) a pledge over
intercompany loan agreements between Midco and
Empark, and between Empark and Dornier; (f) a pledge
over all of the issued and outstanding shares of
(i) Empark, (ii) Dornier, (iii) Estacionamientos Alh ´ondiga,
(iv) Empark Andaluc´ıa, (v) Aparcamientos de Bilbao,
(vi) Maksu and (vii) Emparque; (g) a pledge over (i) 24.5%
of the issued and outstanding shares of SMASSA (as
defined herein) and (ii) 43.0% of the issued and
outstanding shares of EULSA (as defined herein), (h) an
account pledge covering certain bank accounts of
Empark, Dornier and Maksu; and (i) a pledge over all the
credit rights under certain of Empark and Dornier’s
Spanish off-street concession agreements (which include
the rights to receive compensation, payments and owed
amounts under the concession agreements), (collectively,
the ‘‘Post-Closing Collateral’’ and, together with the Issue
Date Collateral, the ‘‘Collateral’’).

The maximum secured amount under over the Collateral
will be limited as necessary to recognize certain
limitations arising under or imposed by local law and
defenses generally available to providers of Collateral
(including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or
transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance,
corporate purpose or benefit, capital maintenance or
similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights
of creditors generally) or other considerations under
applicable law. In particular, (a) the maximum secured
amounts under the Collateral granted by Empark,Dornier
and Maksu will be limited to the value of the Amended
and Restated Debt Repayment Proceeds Loan and certain
cash proceeds of the Offering retained at Midco (which is
expected in total to be approximately e460 million), and
will not secure those obligations or liabilities which, if
secured, will constitute an infringement of Spanish
financial assistance laws in accordance with Articles 143.2
and 150 of the Spanish Companies Act (see ‘‘Risk
_Factors—Risk Relating to the Notes—Spanish Guarantee_
_and Collateral Limitations’’) and (b) the maximum secured_
amount under the Collateral over the issued and
outstanding shares of Emparque, in connection with
Portuguese stamp tax issues will be limited to
e40 million. For a description of such limitations, see
‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes—Certain of the
_Note Guarantees will be limited to a specified amount,_
_and each Note Guarantee will be subject to certain_
_limitations on enforcement and may be limited by_
_applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may_
_limit its validity and enforceability’’ and ‘‘Limitations on_
_Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the_
_Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations’’)._
Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the lenders
under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedge
counterparties will be repaid with the proceeds from any
enforcement of the Collateral in priority to the Notes.
See ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
_Intercreditor Agreement.’’_

**Intercreditor Agreement . . . . . . . .** The Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging
obligations will also be secured by first-ranking security
interests in the Collateral. In addition, the Indenture will
permit certain other indebtedness to be secured by
security interests in the Collateral. The lenders under the
Revolving Credit Facility and the holders of certain
hedging obligations will receive priority with respect to
the distribution of the proceeds of the Collateral in the
event of an enforcement of the security interests over the
Collateral. The intercreditor relationships among the
lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility, the holders of
the Notes and the holders of certain other indebtedness
(including hedging counterparties) will be governed by
the Intercreditor Agreement. See ‘‘Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.’’_

Each of these covenants is subject to significant
exceptions and qualifications. See ‘‘Description of Notes—
_Certain Covenants.’’_

**Additional Amounts . . . . . . . . . . .** All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any
of the Guarantors under or with respect to the Notes or
any Note Guarantee will be made free and clear of and
without withholding or deduction for, or on account of,
any present or future Taxes unless the withholding or
deduction of such Taxes is then required by law. If any
deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any such
Taxes will at any time be required to be made, the Issuer
or the relevant Guarantor will, subject to certain
exceptions, pay the additional amounts necessary so that
the net amount received by the holders of the relevant
Notes after the deduction or withholding will equal the
respective amounts that would have been received in
respect of such payments in the absence of such
withholding or deduction. See ‘‘Description of Notes—
_Additional Amounts.’’_

**Denominations . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Notes will be issued in registered form and
transferable in minimum denominations of e100,000 and
integral multiples of e1,000 in excess thereof.

under the U.S. Securities Act or the securities laws of any
other jurisdiction. The Notes are subject to restrictions on
transferability and resale. Holders of the Notes will not
have the benefit of any exchange or registration rights.
See ‘‘Notice to Investors.’’

**No Prior Market . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Notes will be new securities for which there is
currently no market. Although the Initial Purchasers have
informed the Issuer that they intend to make a market in
the Notes, they are not obligated to do so and may
discontinue market-making at any time without notice.
Accordingly, there can be no assurance that a liquid
market for the Notes will develop or be maintained.

**Listing . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Application will be made for listing particulars to be
approved by the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and for the
Notes to be listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on the Euro MTF
market. There can be no assurance that the Notes will be,
or will remain, so listed and admitted to trading on the
Euro MTF market.

**Use of Proceeds . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** We will use the gross proceeds of the Notes as set forth
in ‘‘Use of Proceeds.’’

24


-----

**Governing Law . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Indenture, the Notes and the Note Guarantees will
be governed by the laws of the State of New York. The
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Intercreditor
Agreement will be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, English law except that certain
provisions of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will
be interpreted in accordance with New York law. The
Security and Guarantee Documents creating security
interests over the Collateral will be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, Spanish, Portuguese and
Luxembourg law, as applicable. For the avoidance of
doubt, Articles 470-1 to 470-19 (inclusive) of the
Luxembourg Law dated August 10, 1915 on commercial
companies, as amended, will not be applicable to the
Notes.

**Trustee . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** BNY Mellon Corporate Trustee Services Limited.

prospective investors should refer to ‘‘Risk Factors’’ for a
discussion of certain factors they should carefully consider

# Summary Financial, Operating and Other Information

The following tables set forth summary historical consolidated financial, operating and other
information of the Empark Group and the Group, respectively, as of and for the periods
indicated.

Unless otherwise indicated the summary financial information presented herein is derived from
the historical consolidated financial information of (1) the Empark Group (i) as of and for the
year ended December 31, 2016, as extracted from the 2016 Empark Group Consolidated
Financial Statements, and (ii) for the year ended December 31, 2017, as extracted from the
2017 Special Purpose Empark Group Consolidated Financial Position, Income and Cashflow
Statements and (2) for the Group (i) as of December 31, 2017, as extracted from the 2017
Group Consolidated Financial Statements, (ii) as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018,
as extracted from the 2018 Group Consolidated Financial Statements, and (iii) as of and for the
nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2019, as extracted from the Interim Group
Consolidated Financial Statements.

The unaudited financial information for the twelve months ended September 30, 2019,
presented herein, is derived by adding our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial
information for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 extracted from the Interim Group
Consolidated Financial Statements and our audited consolidated financial information for the
year ended December 31, 2018 extracted from the 2018 Group Consolidated Financial
Statements and subtracting our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial
information for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 extracted from the Interim Group
Consolidated Financial Statements.

The 2017 Special Purpose Empark Group Consolidated Financial Position, Income and Cashflow
Statements are special purpose financial statements of the Empark Group which have been
prepared solely for inclusion in this offering memorandum. They do not include information on
the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the notes thereto and other disclosures as
they solely disclose the relevant and necessary notes for an appropriate understanding of the
consolidated special purpose financial position, income and cash flow statements of the Empark
Group as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017. The summary historical consolidated
financial information presented below includes certain non-IFRS measures that we use to
evaluate our operating and financial performance. These measures are not identified as
accounting measures under IFRS and therefore should not be considered as alternative
measures to evaluate the performance of the Group or to any performance measures prepared
in accordance with IFRS. See ‘‘Presentation of Financial and Other Information.’’

Effective January 1, 2019 the Group has adopted IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective
method of adoption with the date of initial application (January 1, 2019). Under this method,
the reclassifications and the adjustments arising from the new lease accounting rules are
directly recognized in the opening balance on January 1, 2019.

The summary unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information presented below
presents certain consolidated financial information adjusted to give pro forma effect to the
Offering and the Redemption on the financial position and net financial expenses of the Group
as of and for the twelve months ended September 30, 2019. The summary unaudited pro
_forma consolidated financial information has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and_
does not purport to represent what the actual consolidated financial position or net financial
expenses of the Group would have been if the Offering and the Redemption had occurred on
(i) September 30, 2019 for the purposes of the calculation of net financial position and
(ii) October 1, 2019 for the purposes of the calculation of net financial expenses, nor does such
summary unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information purport to project the
Group’s consolidated financial position and net financial expenses at any future date or for any
future period. The summary unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information presented

26


-----

below includes non-IFRS measures and is based on available information and certain
assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable and may differ materially from the
actual amounts. The primary, unaudited pro forma financial measures that are used in this
offering memorandum include pro forma cash and cash equivalents, pro forma gross debt, pro
_forma net debt, pro forma net recourse debt and pro forma cash interest expense. See_
‘‘Summary—Summary Financial, Operating and Other Information—Summary Pro Forma
_Financial Information.’’ The results of operations for the interim periods or prior years are not_
necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year or any future period or our
financial condition at any future date. The following summary historical consolidated financial,
operating and other information should be read in conjunction with the information set forth
under the headings ‘‘Presentation of Financial and Other Information,’’ ‘‘Use of Proceeds,’’

(1) We define EBITDA as Operating result excluding amortization and depreciation provisions and losses of unrecoverable
credit and impairment and result through disposal of fixed assets. EBITDA is a non-IFRS measure that we use to evaluate our
operating and financial performance and should not be considered as an alternative measure to accounting measures under
IFRS. Includes EBITDA impact of e0.8 million derived from the application of IFRS 16 starting from January 1, 2019. See
‘‘Presentation of Financial and Other Information.’’

(2) We define EBITDA Margin as EBITDA divided by the sum of revenues and other operating income.

(3) We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted for (i) Non-recurring headquarter operating expenses (including
redundancy payments and other related personnel costs), (ii) Non-recurring business unit expenses and (iii) Other ‘‘one-off’’
items or non-recurring gains and losses (including gains and losses realized from the sale of parking spaces to local residents
and gains and losses realized on the sale and acquisition of parking facilities and equity stakes in new subsidiaries). Gains and
losses realized on acquisitions could include negative goodwill which could have an impact on our income statement. Includes
EBITDA impact of e0.8 million derived from the application of IFRS 16 starting from January 1, 2019. Adjusted EBITDA is a
non-IFRS measure that we use to evaluate our operating and financial performance and should not be considered as an
alternative measure to accounting measures under IFRS.

We define Pro Forma EBITDA as Adjusted EBITDA adjusted for terminated contracts and new contracts as well as overheads
savings. See ‘‘Presentation of Financial and Other Information.’’

The following table reconciles Pro Forma EBITDA to Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA to EBITDA, for the periods
presented:

(a) Represents one-off items or non-recurring overhead costs, such as transaction costs incurred with the Empark
Acquisition, redundancy payments and other advisory and consultancy costs. In the year ended December 31, 2016, we
incurred e0.9 million non-recurring expenses in corporate studies and consultations and e0.4 million in other expenses that
are ‘‘one off’’ or considered non-recurring. Expenses incurred in the year ended December 31, 2017 are related to
redundancy payments, costs associated with those redundancies, refinancing costs and other one-off costs. Non-recurring
headquarter operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018, only included transaction costs incurred in
connection with the Empark Acquisition. For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, we incurred e0.4 million in
redundancy payments and consultancy fees of e0.4 million.

(b) Represents redundancy payments and other related one-off personnel costs in our business units, payments in
connection with judicial awards or legal judgments and other expenses that are ‘‘one off’’ items or considered
non-recurring. In the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred non-recurring expenses mainly relating to severance
payments. In the year ended December 31, 2017, the full amount of e0.9 million was also related to severance payments
within the business units. The figure for the year ended December 31, 2018, is again related mainly to severance payments
within the business units. For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, we incurred e1.1 million in Non-recurring
business unit expenses.

(c) Represents gains and losses from the sale of parking spaces to local residents, gains and losses recognized on the sale
of parking facilities, fees or other payments arising in connection with our early termination or cancellation of concessions
and other contracts and other gains and losses that are ‘‘one off’’ or considered non-recurring by the Group. The amount
for the year ended December 31, 2016 represents a ‘‘one-off’’ gain of e0.3 million, relating to a profit resulting from the
sale of residents spaces. We incurred e0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and e0.1 million for the year
ended December 31, 2018. During the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2019, we incurred e0.1 million and
e0.3 million, respectively.

(d) Pro forma adjustments to Adjusted EBITDA comprise adjustments for terminated contracts and new contracts as well as
overheads savings. The portfolio of contracts used to determine Pro Forma EBITDA for any applicable period is determined
on a like-for-like basis and is re-evaluated annually.

(4) We define Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by Adjusted Revenue.

(7) We define Adjusted Revenue as revenues plus other operating income less other non-recurring revenue less Other ‘‘one
off’ items or non-recurring gains and losses (including gains and losses realized from the sale of parking spaces to local
residents and gains and losses realized on the sale of parking facilities). Adjusted Revenue is a non-IFRS measure that we use to
evaluate our operating and financial performance and should not be considered as an alternative measure to accounting
measures under IFRS. See ‘‘Presentation of Financial and Other Information.’’

The following table reconciles Revenues to Adjusted Revenue for the periods presented:

(b) Represents gains and losses realized from the sale of parking spaces to local residents, gains and losses recognized on
the sale of parking facilities and other gains and losses that are ‘‘one off’’ items or considered non-recurring.

(8) We define Free Cash Flow as Adjusted EBITDA, less maintenance capital expenditure, changes in working capital, cash taxes
and other non-cash items. See ‘‘Presentation of Financial and Other Information.’’

(a) High working capital movement for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, and the year ended December 31,
2018, was mainly a consequence of non-current advisory, refinancing and transaction costs incurred in connection with the
Empark Acquisition accrued during the year ended December 31, 2017, and paid during the year ended December 31,
2018.

(b) High cash taxes for the year ended December 31, 2017 were due to one-off payments of tax regularization during the
last three months of 2017.

(c) Other non-cash items include other payments received and any payments in connection with IFRIC 12.

(9) We define Free Cash Flow Conversion as Free Cash Flow divided by Adjusted EBITDA. See ‘‘Presentation of Financial and
_Other Information.’’_

(10) During August 2018, the Parent Guarantor effected a shareholder distribution by way of a repayment of a total of
e14.9 million (comprising e3.1 million principal and e11.8 million accrued interest) in connection with its shareholder loan with
Arena Ventures. During March 2019, the Parent Guarantor effected a shareholder distribution by way of a repayment of a
total of e22.3 million (comprising e18.6 million principal and e3.7 million accrued interest) in connection with its shareholder
loan with Arena Ventures. These repayments were possible due to the strong over-performance and de-leveraging of the
business that has led to the generation of significant cash flows.

(9) Adjusted EBITDA by business line reflects certain reclassifications of business line information as presented in the Group’s
audited financial statements in order to separately present amounts for our off-street concession business in this offering
memorandum. Consolidated amounts are not affected by these reclassifications. We define Adjusted EBITDA by business line as
EBITDA for the relevant business line adjusted for (i) Reallocation of overhead costs and non-recurring headquarter operating
expenses, (ii) Non-recurring business unit expenses (including redundancy payments and other related personnel costs) and
(iii) Other ‘‘one off’’ or non-recurring gains and losses (including gains and losses realized from the sale of parking spaces to
local residents and gains and losses realized on the sale and acquisition of parking facilities). Includes EBITDA impact from the
application of IFRS 16 starting from January 1, 2019. Adjusted EBITDA by business line is a non-IFRS measure that we use to
evaluate our operating and financial performance and should not be considered as an alternative measure to accounting
measures under IFRS. See ‘‘Presentation of Financial and Other Information.’’

# Risk Factors

_An investment in the Notes involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the_
_following risks, together with other information provided to you in this offering memorandum,_
_in deciding whether to invest in the Notes. The occurrence of any of the events discussed_
_below could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial_
_condition. If these events occur, the trading prices of the Notes could decline, and we may not_
_be able to pay all or part of the interest or principal on the Notes, and you may lose all or part_
_of your investment. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we now deem_
_immaterial could also adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition_
_or our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and affect your investment._

_This offering memorandum contains ‘‘forward-looking’’ statements that involve risks and_
_uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-_
_looking statements as a result of certain factors, including the risks faced by us described below_
_and elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. Save as required by applicable law, we are not_
_obliged to, and we make no commitment to, release publicly any revisions or updates to these_
_forward-looking statements to reflect events, circumstances or unanticipated events occurring_
_after the date of this offering memorandum. See ‘‘Forward-Looking Statements.’’_

## Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry

**_We are subject to intense competition that can constrain our ability to win, renew and acquire_**
**_parking concessions, as well as, in some instances reduced volumes of concessions being_**
**_tendered, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, results of_**
**_operations or financial condition._**
Our principal business activity is the development and management of off-street parking
concessions, primarily in Spain and Portugal. We also manage on-street parking concessions for
municipalities and, to a lesser extent, operate our off-street contract management business,
which involves contracts to manage parking lots on behalf of public authorities, primarily
airports and hospitals, and a limited number of private entities. The off-street and on-street
parking concession sector in Spain and Portugal is a highly competitive market, with a variety
of competitors ranging from small, local single-concession operators to large, regional, national
and international operators with a significant number of concessions. Some of these larger
competitors are divisions of diversified global corporations with substantial financial,
management and other resources and capabilities.

In Spain and Portugal, concessions for parking facilities are generally awarded and renewed
through competitive tenders. In the bidding phase of a concession, a significant number of
competing bidders may participate, including large construction groups and financial investors.
Generally, public tenders for off-street concessions and off-street contract management are the
most competitive, focusing primarily on economics. Public tenders for on-street concessions
tend to be less competitive, given the limited number of potential operators, and tend to focus
on the technical specifications of the concession and the demonstrated experience of the
bidder. There also may be significant competition to renew existing concessions. For example,
between January 1, 2016 and September 30, 2019, we had an average Replacement Rate of
approximately 189% for off-street concessions and 73% for total on-street concessions. The
Replacement Rate of off-street concessions was in part due to certain city councils, primarily
the City Council in Madrid, not retendering the concession at expiry as further discussed below.
This intense competition also materializes in a significant number of challenges by
non-awarded bidders in relation to the granting of car parks. We may lose bids where we do
not want to lower our return expectations or where a competitor may operate the concession
more efficiently (for example, if it manages other car parks nearby). If we are unable to
compete successfully in the future, our Replacement Rates may decline. In addition, there is
intense competition in Spain and Portugal to acquire any concessions that may be available for

41


-----

sale by their existing holders or owners (or to acquire concession operators). Certain
competitors and new entrants in the market may have greater financial resources, lower cost
bases than we have or more aggressive profitability thresholds. Consequently, they may be able
to bid more competitively than we can in public tenders for concessions or may be able to
offer more commercially favorable terms than us. As a result of such competition, we may not
be able to win new concessions or renew existing concessions on commercially favorable terms,
which are consistent with those we have negotiated in the past, or at all. Our inability to
successfully compete to win new concessions or to retain existing concessions could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

In addition, certain city councils, such as the City Council in Madrid, may choose not to
retender a car park once it has expired, but rather, in-source and operate the car parks
themselves, resulting in a loss of revenue, loss of opportunity to tender for a competitor’s
former concession and increased competition for other car parks. The loss of revenue, loss of
opportunity and increased competition resulting from insourcing of car parking concessions by
city councils could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or
financial condition.

**_We are dependent on the macroeconomic environment, and economic or financial instability in_**
**_Spain, Portugal and other countries in the EU and elsewhere may adversely affect our_**
**_operations and financial position._**
Our operations are principally located in Europe, mainly in Spain and Portugal, which for the
twelve months ended September 30, 2019 collectively accounted for 96.1% of our Adjusted
Revenue. Accordingly, our financial performance is particularly affected by economic and
financial conditions in Spain and Portugal, and our results of operations may be adversely
affected if difficult macroeconomic circumstances in Spain and Portugal cause a sustained or
significant decrease in the demand for parking services.

The EU as a whole is an important market for our business, and adverse economic effects
within the EU could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations or
financial condition. Conditions in Europe have resulted in increased volatility in global capital
markets, which could continue for the foreseeable future. The increased volatility may result in
a reduction in automobile travel of a discretionary nature, which could adversely impact traffic
levels in a number of locations where we operate parking facilities.

Continuing or renewed instability in the European markets, the stability of the euro or the EU
and the uncertainty derived from the refugee crisis has contributed to weak European
economic performance. Future developments may continue to be dependent upon a number of
political and economic factors.

Concerns persist regarding the debt burden of certain European countries and their ability to
meet future financial obligations, the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the
euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances in individual
member states of the Eurozone. These concerns could lead to the exit of one or more countries
from the Eurozone and the reintroduction of national currencies in such countries.

The UK’s decision by advisory referendum on June 23, 2016, to leave the EU (‘‘Brexit’’) and the
delivery by the UK of notice under Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty of its intention to leave the
EU has triggered a process of negotiations which will determine the terms of the UK’s
withdrawal from, and its future relationship with, the EU. It is possible that Brexit will cause
support in other EU countries to leave the EU to increase, which may further undermine the
stability of the EU. Brexit and its potential consequences could result in significant
macroeconomic deterioration, including, but not limited to, a decrease in GDP or trade in the
EU or other markets in which we operate and recession in the EU and/or the wider global
economy. The continuing unpredictability and potentially negative outcomes of Brexit could
have adverse consequences for the macroeconomic landscape in the EU as a whole or in certain

EU member states and, as a result, our business, results of operating or financial condition may
be materially affected.

On October 1, 2017, the Catalan government announced and held a referendum which passed
in favor of Catalonia’s independence from Spain. However, the Spanish government did not
recognize it as legitimate and the Spanish courts declared it to be illegal. The Catalan
parliament subsequently approved Catalonia’s declaration of independence and in response the
Spanish government suspended Catalonia’s autonomy, dissolved the Catalan parliament, called
for new regional elections in December 2017 and arrested a number of public officials in
Catalonia (who were subsequently convicted by the Spanish Supreme Court in October 2019).
Following these events, tensions between the Spanish government and the Catalan
government remain high. The implications of the referendum and declaration of
independence, including the increasing political tensions and social unrest and disputes over its
legitimacy, could result in further political instability in Catalonia, which may negatively impact
our existing concessions in Catalonia and/or our ability to conduct future business in Catalonia.
Our business in Catalonia generated 6.7% of our Adjusted Revenue during the twelve months
ended September 30, 2019.

**_Our concessions are granted for a limited period of time and are subject to termination by the_**
**_granting authority on public interest grounds under circumstances stipulated under public law_**
**_or under the terms and conditions contractually agreed to as well as under the circumstances_**
**_set forth under applicable private law which may also apply with respect to surface rights_**
**_agreements._**
As of September 30, 2019, we had 285 off-street concessions (including 78 resident contracts)
and 114 on-street concessions (including seven contracts exclusively dedicated to tow-away
services) granted by municipalities and private entities. Our off-street parking concessions are
typically long-term arrangements with a maximum term of up to 50 years (although certain
older contracts and surface rights agreements in Portugal, such as Cam ˜oes or Alexandre
Herculano, have longer terms), and our on-street parking concessions in some cases could have
a maximum term of up to 25 years (or 20 years in Portugal). Moreover, while these concessions
are generally long-term arrangements, most of our concessions will be subject to a public
tender process at the end of their term. Out of our top 25 contracts by gross margin, four will
expire in the next two years. The loss of, or the renewal on less commercially favorable terms
of, a significant number of our existing concessions, or one or more of our largest concessions,
could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.

In addition, under applicable public laws, the relevant awarding authorities in Spain and
Portugal may terminate or recover concessions prior to their expiration on public interest
grounds, which is subject to interpretation, or under certain other circumstances stipulated
under applicable public law, subject to judicial review of the grounds for termination. See
‘‘Regulation—Spain—Early termination events and consequences’’ and ‘‘Regulation—Portugal—
_Termination of the concession.’’_

We are also subject to the termination rights set forth in the terms and conditions in our
agreements as well as private law which may also apply with respect to our surface rights
agreements.

Additionally, we have continued to operate a small number of our concessions past the
termination date before the contract is renewed and awarded to us or awarded to another
party. If we operate the concession beyond the term of the contract, we may have limited
recourse should the municipality terminate our services during such periods.

Generally, in the event of early termination of the concession not due to fault of the
concessionaire, the concessionaire will be entitled to compensation from the municipality for
the amount of the investments it has made in carrying out the terms of the concession based
on the degree to which the investments have been amortized. We may also seek compensation

43


-----

provided by law or contract to cover our anticipated profits for the remaining duration of the
concession agreements if the awarding authority terminates the concession, although there can
be no assurance that we will be successful. Additionally, the public authority has some
discretion in interpreting the terms of the concession, especially when determining whether we
have complied with its terms. If we are unsuccessful in seeking compensation from the
municipality, our only recourse may be litigation, which may involve additional expenses and
an extended period of time to reach a resolution. Even if successful, the public authorities may
not have the resources available to satisfy any claim by us for compensation for lost investment
or profit on a timely basis in the event of a future economic downturn.

Additionally, certain of our contract management agreements allow the counterparty to
remove some parking spaces from our management without compensation for public interest
reasons. While this has not occurred in the past to a significant degree, if the counterparty
were to exercise such a clause, our rights to contest this action may be limited.

**_Changes in transportation and traffic patterns could materially adversely affect demand at our_**
**_facilities._**
A variety of factors are contributing to changes in the transportation industry that could have
a negative impact on our business, including changes in regulations, increased use of public
transport by end customers and car sharing, in particular in connection with our off-street
concessions where our EBITDA Margins are most affected by changes in demand, and to a
lesser extent in connection with our on-street concessions. Changes in environmental and
traffic control regulations could reduce demand for, and volumes in, our off-street parking
facilities that could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.
For example some municipalities may impose traffic congestion charges in urban areas, reduce
the availability of on-street parking spaces, promote the use of public transportation in lieu of
automobiles or limit automobile access to urban areas as has been the case in Madrid Central
in Spain. The actions of regulators or international bodies, such as the recent referral of the
Spanish government to the Court of Justice of the EU for its alleged failure to protect its
citizens from air pollution, may also result in new or more stringent environmental and traffic
control regulations which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial
condition. Governments may also (whether or not as a response to regulatory or international
action or pressure) increase the tax levels on automobiles and petroleum for environmental
reasons, which may reduce traffic. We may also be materially adversely affected by temporary
or permanent changes to traffic routes or road closures, which may make it more difficult to
access our parking facilities and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations or financial condition.

**_Changing consumer preferences may lead to a decline in parking demand, which could have a_**
**_material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations._**
Ride sharing services such as Uber or Cabify, along with the potential for electric and
autonomous vehicles or other new sharing services as with scooters, motorcycles or cars, may
lead to a decline in parking demand in cities and urban areas. While we devote considerable
effort and resources to analyze and respond to consumer preferences and changes to consumer
preferences and the markets in which we operate, consumer preferences cannot be predicted
with certainty and can change rapidly. Additionally, changes in consumer behaviors by using
mobile phone applications and on-line parking reservation services that help drivers reserve
parking with garage, lots and individual owner spaces cannot be predicted with certainty and
could change current customers’ parking preferences. If we are unable to anticipate and
respond to trends in the consumer marketplace and the industry, including but not limited to
market displacement by delivery service companies, car sharing companies and changing
technologies, it could constrain our business and have a material and adverse impact on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_In any particular period in which we experience a decrease in our revenues, our operating_**
**_expenses may not decrease at the same rate, which could have a material adverse effect on_**
**_our net cash flows, margins and profits._**
Many of the expenses associated with operating concessions are relatively fixed. These expenses
include personnel costs, interest, rent, property taxes, insurance and utilities. If we are unable
to decrease our costs significantly or rapidly when demand for our parking concessions
decreases, the decline in our revenues can have a particularly adverse effect on our net cash
flows and profits. This effect can be especially pronounced during periods of economic
contraction or slow economic growth. Where cost cutting efforts are insufficient to offset
declines in revenues, we could experience a material decline in margins and potentially
negative cash flows which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations or financial condition.

**_In our off-street and on-street parking concessions, the tariff rates that we can charge our_**
**_customers are governed by our concession agreements._**
The revenues that we generate from our off-street and on-street parking concessions is
dependent on our tariff rates. The tariff structure is established under our concession
agreements and we generally have limited or no ability to independently raise tariffs beyond
the contractual provisions (usually, based on the rate of inflation, which in some cases requires
the approval of the relevant municipality). Before bidding for any concession project, we
conduct an analysis to determine the conditions under which we believe such concession can
be operated profitably. If the assumptions underlying our analysis prove to be incorrect and
our tariffs do not generate sufficient revenues to cover our costs, we may be unable to
increase our tariffs or reduce our costs in order for the concession to remain profitable, which
could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. This
effect could be compounded with respect to our long-term concession agreements.

**_According to the Law on the De-indexation of the Spanish Economy, new concession contracts_**
**_will not include the right to increase tariffs in accordance with inflation. Tariffs may only be_**
**_increased in line with the direct cost of the services and goods provided under each_**
**_concession contract._**
The Law on the De-indexation of the Spanish Economy, approved March 30, 2015, provides
new rules for the review of monetary values in contracts awarded by public authorities and
alters the past regime that was based on the principle of said monetary values being modified
by virtue of price indexes or formulas. Instead, it takes into account only significant costs of the
underlying goods and services of the activity (such as energy costs, or labor costs when the
labor force needed for the rendering of the service is deemed significant, but only up to the
increase of wages of civil servants), in proportion to the activity’s total costs. In any event,
financial costs and amortization costs, general expenditures and structural costs, as well as tax
increases, are excluded from update.

This new regulation has no retroactive effect and should not affect contracts already awarded
to Empark (nor any extension of the same) but it will affect contracts awarded after the entry
into force of the Royal Decree 55/2017, dated February 3, 2017. According to such Royal
Decree, the bidding terms and conditions of each contract will have to determine, whenever a
tariff update is foreseen, the update calculation method to be used in each case (which must
be elaborated by the awarding authority pursuant to the principles of the De-Indexation Law
and in view of the cost structures of at least five entities operating in the relevant sector).
Awarding authorities also have the possibility to provide for a standard calculation method
approved by the Council of Ministers for each sector (to date no such standard calculation
methods have been approved).

**_The financial difficulties faced by municipalities that grant us concessions could materially_**
**_adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition._**
Most of our concession arrangements are with municipalities in Spain and Portugal. Under a
majority of our on-street concessions the municipality receives the parking revenues under
those concessions and remits the relevant concession fee to us. As a result, we bear credit risk
with respect to these concessions and such credit risk may be exacerbated by the impact of a
future economic downturn in Spain and Portugal and potential austerity measures imposed by
the national governments. In the event that a municipality experiences financial difficulties, we
may not receive payments under the concessions for months, or even years, and may be
obliged to continue providing services under the concessions, regardless of such outstanding
payments, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or
financial condition. For example, during the last economic downturn in Spain and Portugal, we
experienced a significant increase in working capital as a result of delays in payment by certain
municipalities. Additionally, in the event that we become entitled to receive compensation
from a municipality under one of our concessions, such payment could also be materially
delayed.

In addition, the financial difficulties faced by municipalities may result in delays in payments
due to the concessionaire. These delays may ultimately result in litigation against the granting
authority.

**_We might be required to complete formal licensing proceedings in Portugal and Spain that_**
**_could result in our need to seek additional approvals from the municipalities and to incur_**
**_additional licensing taxes, costs deriving from the need to update according to new technical_**
**_parameters, fines and complementary sanctions for potential breaching of municipal licensing_**
**_requirements._**
In general, surface rights agreements and administrative concessions in Portugal include clauses
stipulating that upon awarding of the surface right or the administrative concession, the
operator shall seek approval from the Portuguese municipality with respect to the construction
project and, in a significant number of contracts, it is further stipulated that the car park
operation must begin upon the issuance of the applicable municipal use permit (authorizing
the use of a certain construction for a specific use). The understanding and practice of the
majority of Portuguese municipalities has been that, although the construction project is
subject to municipal approval, the construction is not subject to the licensing procedure to
which constructions in general are subject, given the fact that it has been widely understood
that these are exempted from licensing in article 7 of Decree-Law no. 555/99 of December, as
amended by Law no. 60/2007 and Decree-Law no. 26/2010 which states that the works
promoted by the Public Administration as well as works promoted by concessionaires of public
works are exempt from municipal licensing. Operating without a use permit is punishable by
administrative fines and, in some cases, closure of the car park. Ancillary penalties may also be
applied and include: (i) the seizure of objects belonging to the responsible entity that have
been used in the noncompliant behavior; (ii) prohibition from exercising the relevant activity
within the municipality; and (iii) prevention from obtaining public funding and subsidies.
Emparque does not hold a use permit for one of its car parks but is in the process of obtaining
a permit from the appropriate municipality.

In Spain, most of the City Councils understand that the construction and operation of a car
park is subject to the corresponding municipal licenses. However, some City Councils consider
that the car parks they sponsor do not require such licenses.

If municipalities were to require formal licensing to operate such parking facilities, this would
require us to submit additional projects and be charged with additional licensing taxes and
costs in order to obtain such licenses. Note that the corresponding City Council may find that
the legalization procedure subject to the current technical parameters may not be the same
required when the car parks were built. Therefore, additional investments may be required. We

46


-----

may also incur fines or be subject to sanctions for potential breaching of municipal licensing
requirements. In addition, in the event that such licenses are not granted, we may be unable
to operate the relevant concession and the municipalities may argue that we have breached
the relevant surface rights agreements and terms of administrative concessions, which could
materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_Under our concessions, in certain situations, an insolvency proceeding or a change of control_**
**_may result in the termination of the concession._**
Under the terms of our concessions and Spanish and Portuguese law, the municipality may
terminate the concession in the event that insolvency or winding-up proceedings are instituted.
If an enforcement action is brought under the Indenture or the Revolving Credit Facility, for
example, we may be forced into insolvency or winding-up proceedings that could give rise to
such termination (subject to compensation for unamortized investments). See ‘‘Regulation—
_Spain—Early termination events and consequences’’ and ‘‘Regulation—Portugal—Termination of_
_the concession.’’ In any case, according to the current Spanish Public Sector Contracts_
(Ley 9/2017, de 8 de noviembre, de Contratos del Sector P´ublico de 2017) (the ‘‘Law 9/2017’’),
even where insolvency has been declared, the concession will not automatically be terminated
by the municipality. Contracts awarded prior to the effectiveness of Law 9/2017 are governed
by public procurement legislation in force when such contracts were awarded. The municipality
may declare the termination upon the declaration of insolvency and this termination will only
be mandatory upon the start of the winding-up phase under insolvency proceedings (although,
in this latter case, transfer of the concession to a party authorized to carry out such business
might be done to avoid early termination).

Additionally, under certain contracts, public authorities impose certain restrictions on the
transfers of ownership of the concessionaire, including a change of control clause, which
prohibits the transfer of the ownership of the concessionaire without the prior approval of the
public authority. There is a risk that one or more municipal councils might consider, in practice,
that an indirect transfer also falls within the scope of this restriction. Should the municipal
councils of these contracts apply such interpretation, it could be argued that such
interpretation goes beyond the stated legal provision.

However, in the event of an enforcement action under the terms of the Notes or Note
Guarantees which resulted in the transfer of ownership of Empark, or a change in the
shareholding of Empark for other reasons, the local authorities may attempt to cancel our
concessions on such basis. In addition, the uncertainty concerning the transferability of such
concessions itself could reduce the value placed on the concessions by third parties and
ultimately reduce the amount recovered in the event of an enforcement action.

Direct assignment of the concession is subject to the granting authority’s prior approval, while
the indirect assignment may also be subject to this requirement, depending on the specific
contractual documents and its interpretation by the granting authority. See ‘‘Regulation—
_Spain—Assignment of the concessions and change of control.’’ The enforcement of the_
Collateral may also trigger these requirements.

The mortgage of a concession requires in general the prior approval by the granting authority.
This authorization will be without prejudice to the second authorization which will be required
upon enforcement of the mortgage. The contractual documents may foresee the need to
obtain the granting authority’s prior approval for the placement of additional security relating
to a concession. For example, placing a pledge over the compensation or other credit rights
that the concessionaire is entitled to receive upon early termination in public works concession
awarded post-enforcement of Law 40/2015, of October 1, 2015 (‘‘Law 40/2015’’), is subject to
the granting authority’s prior approval. However, these restrictions do not apply to the
concessions included under the Collateral and thus, no prior authorization is required for the
constitution of the Collateral.

**_We generate a substantial amount of revenues and cash flow from our concessions granted_**
**_by various municipalities. If we are unable to maintain our position as a reputable_**
**_concessionaire, we may be unable to win bids to renew our existing concessions or enter into_**
**_new concessions, and our business, results of operations or financial condition may be_**
**_materially and adversely affected._**
In the year ended December 31, 2018, a substantial amount of our Adjusted EBITDA was
generated under a number of our key concession contracts and any limitations on our
operations under these agreements or reduced demand due to changes in traffic patterns
could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Additionally,
our risk is compounded as we are not geographically diversified across Europe, with the vast
majority of our operations being conducted in Spain and Portugal. If policies of either of these
municipalities change with respect to traffic patterns, or these municipalities experience
financial difficulties that affect the payment of our fees under such concession agreements, or
if the volume of traffic declines in these locations, it could adversely affect our business, results
of operations or financial condition. Additionally, these municipalities may ask us to enter into
amendments to our concessions to lower the fees payable to us or to agree to other terms
which are less commercially favorable than the original agreements. While municipalities may
not unilaterally amend our concessions without indemnifying us for the damages we suffer as
a result of such changes, we may agree to such amendments in order to maintain our
relationships with the municipalities.

We believe the experience of our management, the quality of our reputation in the key
markets in which we operate and the rapport that we maintain with the municipalities
differentiate us from our competitors and are important factors for the generation of new
business opportunities that support our growth. If we are unable to maintain good working
relationships with the municipalities and other third parties, or if we do not meet or exceed
their expectations, such parties may be unwilling to maintain or grow their relationship with
us, in which case our business, results of operations or financial condition may be materially
and adversely affected.

**_Changes in the legal framework for concessions may impose significant costs on us._**
The grant and operation of public concessions in Spain and Portugal is highly regulated. The
legal framework applicable to administrative concessions and other agreements under which
we operate parking facilities is subject to changes which could affect the profitability of our
concessions and agreements. We must comply with a variety of laws and regulations relating to
our concessions, some of which impose substantial financial and other penalties for
non-compliance, including the revocation of a concession. In addition, we are exposed to the
risk of changes in the regulatory regime, which changes could potentially impose additional
costs on our business, and thus have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations
or financial condition. In the event of significant regulatory changes, we may request the
awarding authority in certain circumstances to modify the terms of the concession in order to
restore the economic and financial balance of the relevant concession. However, we can give
no assurance that such an adjustment would be available, that it would apply to our surface
rights agreements in Portugal or that it would be on terms satisfactory to us or could be made
in a timely manner. If such adjustments are not made or do not provide for sufficient or timely
increases in our revenues in respect of such concession, our business, results of operations or
financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In any event, even if such
rebalancing is successful, it would not generally address all the losses we may have already
incurred. Additionally, court proceedings to obtain an order for economic rebalancing of a
concession may take a number of years to reach a conclusion and could result in costly and
time-consuming litigation, regulatory action or otherwise materially adversely affect our
business, results of operations or financial condition.

We are currently involved in court proceedings regarding a recent regulatory change in Spain
requiring off-street concessionaires to pay real estate tax, of which they were previously

48


-----

exempt. Since this was not provided in the concession contracts, we have claimed for the
financial rebalance where appropriate, including, by way of example, in relation to our
off-street concessions in Plaza Espa ˜na in Burgos and Plaza San Agust´ın in Granada. However,
we can give no assurance that the courts will accept our claims and grant us the requested
relief.

Agreements entered into with private entities, although contractual in nature, are also subject
to mandatory private law legal provisions. Changes in the relevant legislation may also have a
negative impact in our business, results of operation or financial condition.

**_Concessions may be subject to modification or interpretation by the awarding authority and_**
**_decisions adopted in relation to concessions may be challenged by a third party with_**
**_legitimate interest._**
The awarding authority is entitled to interpret the concession contract, resolve any doubt
regarding its execution, modify it for reasons of public interest, terminate it early and also
determine the effects of such termination. The awarding authority may contractually modify a
concession contract for public interest reasons that may affect the terms of the service
provision or the price of tariffs paid by users. Even though the awarding authority’s decisions
are deemed immediately enforceable, the concessionaire may challenge such decision before
the courts, requesting their precautionary suspension. If the modification affects the financial
balance of the concession, the administration is required to restore such balance. As of the
date of this offering memorandum, we were involved in seven court proceedings requesting a
financial rebalance following a contractual modification exercised by the awarding authorities.
There can be no assurance that our claims will be accepted by courts or, even if they are, the
court proceedings might last several years.

Any decision adopted by the granting authority in relation to a concession may be challenged
by a third party provided this party has a legitimate interest in the result of the annulment of
such decision. The annulment of a certain decision of the granting authority may have a
negative impact for the concessionaire.

**_We have minority partners for certain concessions and are a minority partner with respect to_**
**_certain of our other businesses._**
We operate a number of our concessions through entities in which we do not have a 100%
stake. In some cases, we have a majority ownership interest and have entered into a
shareholders’ agreement with a minority partner in connection with our bid for concessions in
a particular region. For other concessions, we do not have a controlling interest in the entity
holding the concessions. We are exposed to risks associated with the conduct of our partners in
connection with our less than 100% owned business. For example, our partners may make poor
management decisions, or may fail to supply or be unwilling to supply the required
operational, strategic and financial resources to the business. In such cases, we may be required
to dedicate more resources to manage such projects and as a result, management’s attention
may be diverted from existing operations to focus on such businesses. If any of our partners
were to encounter financial difficulties, change their business strategies or were no longer
willing to participate in the businesses, our business, results of operations or financial condition
could be materially adversely affected. Moreover, in a number of the businesses, we do not
have the power to control the payment of dividends or other distributions, so even if the
business is performing well, we may not be able to extract value through the payment of our
share of any profits. Our shareholder arrangements with such business partners may also
require us to provide additional investments or funding from time to time. For example, in
respect of our temporary consortium with other partners (uniones temporales de empresas), we
are jointly and severally liable for the obligations of the consortium vis-a-vis third parties and
not only for our share of interest. In such cases, we may be jointly and severally liable for
amounts payable by the consortium and our partners may not reimburse us for such payments.
There may also be circumstances in which we may desire or be required to acquire the

49


-----

ownership interests of our partners, and we may not have access to the funds necessary to do
so. In addition, our reputation and business, including our ability to retain and enter into new
contracts with public authorities, could be adversely impacted if any of our partners are alleged
to have engaged in illegal or unethical conduct, such as bribery, money laundering and other
corrupt activities or membership in, or aiding, illegal organizations and we may be liable for
such activities if they occur in connection with any joint ventures.

**_Risks relating to our acquisition strategy may adversely impact our results of operations._**
In the past, a significant portion of our growth has been generated by acquisitions, and we
expect to continue to acquire businesses in the future as part of our growth strategy. We have
an investment committee comprising members of our senior management team and
representatives of our shareholder to review and evaluate and assess potential acquisitions.
When evaluating a potential opportunity, the committee considers targeted investment returns,
the proposed financial models, expected consumer demand for the parking facility, potential
risks and possible economies of scale with existing concession investments.

However, there can be no assurance that any acquisition we make in the future will provide us
with the benefits that we anticipate when entering into the transaction. A slowdown in the
pace or size of our acquisitions could lead to a slower growth rate. The process of integrating
an acquired business may create unforeseen difficulties and expenses. The areas in which we
may face risks in connection with any potential acquisition of a business include, but are not
limited to:

- management time and focus may be diverted from operating our business to acquisition
integration;

- clients or key employees of an acquired business may not remain, which could negatively
impact our ability to grow that acquired business;

- integration of the acquired business’s accounting, information technology, human resources,
and other administrative systems may fail to permit effective management and expense
reduction;

- implementing internal controls, procedures, and policies appropriate for a public company in
an acquired business that lacked some of these controls, procedures, and policies may fail;

- additional indebtedness incurred as a result of an acquisition may impact our financial
position, results of operations, and cash flows; and

- anticipated or unknown liabilities may arise relating to the acquired business.

**_Instances of fraud, bribery and corruption involving our management, employees, business_**
**_partners or agents could expose us to penalties and reputational damage and could hinder_**
**_our ability to acquire or renew concessions or even continue our operating activities._**
While we have internal policies in place to mitigate the risks of fraud, bribery or corruption in
the public concession tender processes we engage in, we cannot assure that we can detect or
prevent every instance of fraud, bribery and corruption involving our employees, business
partners or agents. Prior to the acquisition of Empark by Macquarie, two former members of
our senior management, and certain employees of our business partners, as well as local
government officials, are currently the subject of a preliminary criminal proceeding initiated in
2016 to investigate an alleged fraudulent grant of an on-street public concession by the local
municipality of Palma de Mallorca in 2013 to a joint venture formed by, amongst others, our
subsidiary Dornier. The initial on-street public concession was awarded for four years and
expired earlier this year, but has since been extended by the local municipality for an
additional year. The individuals under investigation are suspected of bribery, fraud, money
laundering, misappropriation of public funds and related crimes, although the company itself is
not currently the subject of investigation. Upon completion of the preliminary criminal

50


-----

proceedings, a determination will be made whether or not to proceed with criminal trial
proceedings. As of the date of this offering memorandum, no formal charges have been filed
in this matter. We have a compliance program in place and are not aware of any similar
incidents within the organization.

We may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and to reputational damage as a result of
such occurrences. Instances of fraud, bribery and corruption may also be taken into account as
a negative factor by public authorities in considering our bids to acquire or renew concessions
and could result in a prohibition to tender, preventing us from winning or renewing, or
making it more difficult for us to win or renew, concessions in the future. The involvement or
association of our senior management, employees, business partners, construction contractors,
suppliers or agents with fraud, bribery or corruption, or allegations or rumors relating thereto,
could negatively impact our reputation and materially adversely affect our business, results of
operations or financial condition.

**_Our ability to expand our business will be dependent upon the availability and cost of capital._**
The off-street concession segment of the Spanish and Portuguese car park industry is highly
fragmented, and there are opportunities for continued consolidation. We intend to continue to
expand our business through organic growth. Our ability to expand our business will depend in
part upon the availability of adequate capital, which in turn will depend in large part upon
cash flow generated by our business and the availability of debt and equity financing. In the
past, weak economic conditions in Spain and Portugal and the effects of the credit crisis and
negative developments with respect to Euro zone financial markets have had a negative impact
on the availability and cost of our bank financing in Spain and Portugal. If we are unable to
obtain the funds needed on acceptable terms, we will not be able to continue to expand our
operations, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or
financial condition.

**_We may fail to successfully carry out construction works under new off-street concessions and_**
**_may not recover our investment._**
When we are awarded a concession for a new parking site, we are exposed to a number of
risks associated with large-scale construction projects, such as the failure of our contractors and
subcontractors to perform, as well as delays and disruptions caused by technical or
environmental problems, adverse weather conditions or other factors. Generally, pursuant to
the terms of the development agreements we enter into in connection with our concessions,
our contractors and subcontractors must indemnify us for any losses or delays resulting from
delays in developing the project and are required to post a performance bond as security for
the performance of their obligations. However, our losses may exceed the amount of the
performance bond or the maximum loss coverage under these agreements, in which case we
would not be adequately compensated for losses derived from construction delays. We may
also be required to engage in costly litigation or arbitration proceedings in order to receive
compensation under these agreements. Further, our ability to obtain compensation under our
development contracts is dependent on the solvency of our contractors and subcontractors.
Construction delays will also postpone the time at which the parking facility will be operational
and therefore the time from which we will begin to receive revenues from a concession, as has
been the case in relation to our concession in Albacete-Jes ´us in Valencia. Such delays will
shorten the revenue-generating term of the concession and may entitle the granting authority
to impose sanctions or terminate the concession, any of which could materially adversely affect
our business, financial conditions or results of operations.

Once the construction of a parking facility on a new site is completed, we are exposed to a
variety of risks in connection with the opening and operation of the new facility, which could
result in us failing to recover our investment in the new facility. For example, the actual
demand for parking spaces at the new site may not meet our expectations, and we may
experience lower than expected volumes and revenues.

**_We may fail to realize the anticipated benefits from, or may incur unanticipated costs_**
**_associated with, future acquisitions and we may also seek to divest some of our properties_**
**_and other assets, any of which may be unsuccessful or divert our management’s attention._**
We may, from time to time, consider acquisitions of other concession operators. Acquisitions
can involve significant risks, such as the integration of the newly-acquired business, the entry
into unfamiliar markets and the diversion of management’s attention from other business
concerns. We may not be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition opportunities in the
future or complete future acquisitions. If we do complete any acquisitions in the future, we
may not be able to successfully integrate the newly-acquired business and we may not realize
the anticipated benefits from the acquisitions, or we may encounter unanticipated costs
associated with the acquisitions. If we fail to identify and enter into attractive markets, to find
suitable business partners who can operate the business effectively, ethically and on reasonable
terms, to identify and operate concessions on acceptable terms, to attract and hire skilled staff,
to implement the required infrastructure or to raise the required funds, our business plans may
be jeopardized and the intended consolidation or increase of our market share may fail to
materialize, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results
of operations.

We may consider and engage in negotiations with respect to disposals of assets from time to
time. Divestitures of some of our assets may yield returns below our investment criteria or even
result in investment losses. In addition, any acquisitions, investments, dispositions or alliances
may demand significant attention from our management that would otherwise be available for
our day-to-day running of the business. Since 2010, we disposed of our car park located on
Calle Sevilla, Madrid, for a total consideration of e22.5 million in 2013, our UK business (other
than our contract at Edinburgh Airport, which was retained but which is expected to be
terminated on January 31, 2020) for a total consideration of e3.9 million in 2018 and our
French business for a total consideration of e0.9 million in 2019.

**_Contractual and other disagreements with awarding entities and counterparties could make us_**
**_liable to them or result in litigation costs or other expenses, which could lower our profits._**
Under the terms of some of our concessions, surface rights agreements and other agreements,
the awarding entity and counterparties may terminate such agreements if we do not
successfully comply with our obligations. This risk is exacerbated in those subsidiaries that are
not wholly-owned, as we depend on the decisions of other shareholders.

From time to time, we are involved in contractual and other disagreements with municipalities
and other public authorities relating to our concession and surface rights agreements and our
operations under such agreements. Such disagreements are more likely to occur during periods
of challenging economic conditions. For the duration of each concession and surface rights
agreements, we are required to maintain the relevant infrastructure asset in satisfactory
condition, and upon the expiration of each concession and surface rights agreements, we must
surrender substantially all assets related to such concession and surface rights agreements to
the relevant municipality without financial compensation. If municipalities claim that we have
failed to comply with the terms of our concession and surface rights agreements, the
concession may be revoked or we may not be successful in extending the agreement at the
end of its term. Alternatively, municipalities may not pay us fees in the full amounts due under
the terms of the concession and surface rights agreements. Any such disputes or delays could
materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.

In addition, we operate a number of our agreements with majority partners and may, from
time to time, participate in consortiums over which we do not exercise control over the day to
day operations and decision making process. If a governmental authority decides to terminate
or amend our concession agreements due to a serious violation of our contractual or
regulatory obligations, such as a failure to maintain the facility creating serious danger to users
or a persistent failure to make payments to the awarding authority, we may not be entitled to

52


-----

full compensation for our initial investment or loss of anticipated profits. In addition, upon a
serious breach of the terms of the concession, the awarding authority could call due any
performance bonds granted by us under the concession agreement, in which case we would be
required to immediately repay any such performance bonds and indemnify the local authority
for any damages claimed in excess of such performance bond amounts. In agreements entered
into with private entities, breach of contractual obligations may also lead to the termination of
said agreements. If any of our existing significant concessions, surface rights agreements or
other agreements are unilaterally terminated or amended by the relevant awarding authorities
or counterparties, our revenues in the future may be reduced, and our business, results of
operations or financial condition may be materially adversely affected.

**_We may incur higher than expected costs as a result of unforeseen maintenance problems or_**
**_committed investments._**
Generally, our maintenance costs are relatively low once our concessions have been built and
are operational. However, many of our concessions are more than ten years old and may incur
unforeseen problems such as water damage, cracks in the walls or foundation or sinking.
Under the terms of the concessions, we are responsible for all maintenance and upkeep at our
facilities, including structural repairs. If we were to experience a significant problem requiring
repairs, our maintenance costs may be higher than expected and we may have limited
operations at a particular facility for a period of time.

In addition, the terms of tender (‘‘Pliegos de Condiciones Administrativas y T´ecnicas’’) (the
‘‘Terms of Tender’’) may include the obligation for the concessionaire to make specific
investments either at the beginning or during the duration of the concession.

Such expenses or reduction in revenue may have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations or financial condition.

**_Labor disputes and other labor matters could lead to loss of revenues or higher costs._**
Most of our employees in Spain are represented by labor unions. In particular, due to its labor
intensive nature, our on-street parking business is subject to the risks associated with a
unionized workforce and we have experienced labor disputes that have led to strikes or other
disruptions in our operations in the past. When one or more of our major collective bargaining
agreements becomes subject to renegotiation, we may disagree with the union on important
issues that, in turn, could lead to a strike, work slowdown or other industrial action. There can
be no assurance that we will be able to renew existing labor union contracts on acceptable
terms. We can also experience labor disputes in other situations, such as due to disagreements
in work practices. A strike, work slowdown or other action could in some cases result in the
effective closure of our facilities, temporary free parking at our facilities or disrupt us from
providing services, which would result in reduced revenues. The result of renegotiating an
existing collective bargaining agreement could result in a substantial increase in labor costs
that we may be unable to recover through our existing contractual arrangements.

Additionally, we may incur expenses in resolving disputes and complying with local laws
relating to overtime, social security and pension contributions, occupational risk matters and
other labor related issues. We may also incur increased labor costs due to competition,
increased minimum wage, employee benefit costs, medical benefits costs or otherwise which
could adversely impact our business, results of operations or financial condition. During 2018,
we experienced a collective labor dispute in our On-street contract in Vigo. Although this
dispute was resolved favorably, there can be no assurance that other labor disputes will not
arise in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations or financial condition. In addition, our employees may claim that they are subject to
a more favorable collective bargaining agreement, which may result in increased labor costs for
us.

**_If we or the limited number of suppliers who we contract with for technology services fail to_**
**_stay current with developments in technology necessary for our business, our operations could_**
**_be harmed and our ability to compete effectively could be diminished._**
Sophisticated information technology and other systems, including systems for the efficient
collection and management of revenue are integral to our business. Our information
technology and other systems must be refined, updated or replaced with more advanced
systems on a regular basis.

Developing and maintaining our systems may require significant capital expenditures,
particularly if there is a significant technological development in the industry that could
necessitate such capital expenditures to maintain sophisticated technology systems and
equipment. In addition, we rely on a limited number of suppliers to develop and maintain our
systems. If we or the limited number of suppliers who we contract with for technology services
are unable to replace or introduce information technology and other systems as quickly as our
competitors or within budgeted costs or schedules when these systems become outdated or
need replacing, or if we are unable to achieve the intended benefits of any new information
technology or other systems, our operations could be harmed and our ability to compete
effectively could be diminished, which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations or financial condition. Further, if we or the limited number of suppliers
who we contract with for technology services fail to keep up with technological advances in
our industry that maintain or improve our cost-effectiveness or add value to the services we
can offer to customers, we may not be eligible to participate in or win competitive public
tenders.

**_Our information technology systems may fail or be interrupted, which could materially_**
**_adversely affect our business. Failure to maintain the integrity of internal or customer data_**
**_could result in faulty business decisions, harm to our reputation and subject us to costs, fines_**
**_and lawsuits._**
We rely on numerous information technology systems that allow us to monitor and manage
our parking concessions and facilities, maintain our financial records, manage our employees
and gather information upon which our management makes decisions regarding our business,
including technical information used in formulating bids for concessions or contracts. The
operation of our business is increasingly dependent on the use of these systems. As a result,
system failures or disruptions (including system failures and disruptions of our technology
suppliers) resulting from computer viruses, cyber-attacks, cyber terrorism, security breaches or
other causes could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or
financial condition.

We also collect and retain large volumes of internal and customer data, including credit card
numbers and other personally identifiable information during the normal course of business.
Using our various information technology systems, we enter, process, summarize and report
such data. We also maintain personally identifiable information about our employees. The
integrity and protection of our customer, employee and company data is critical to our
business. Our customers and employees expect that we will adequately protect their personal
information, and the regulations applicable to security and privacy are increasingly demanding
in certain jurisdictions where we operate. Theft, loss, fraudulent or unlawful use of customer,
employee or company data could harm our reputation and result in remedial and other costs,
fines and lawsuits, which may be material.

**_Natural disasters, acts of terrorism and other unexpected events could disrupt our services._**
Natural disasters, such as storms, earthquakes or floods, acts of terrorism and other unexpected
events, such as large-scale electrical power supply outages, fires and vandalism, may result in
reduced revenues for our parking businesses. Natural disasters may also cause economic
dislocations throughout an urban area, region or country. In addition, terrorist attacks have
resulted in, and may continue to result in, heightened security and traffic control measures in

54


-----

urban areas and increased government regulation of airport facilities. For example, recent
terrorist attacks such as those in Spain, France and Turkey would have a negative impact on
consumer travel and traffic levels in a number of locations where we operate parking facilities.
The occurrence and consequences of such events are unpredictable, and further attacks could
result in reduced traffic levels and decreased volumes for our parking facilities, and thus cause
a reduction in revenues, and our insurance may not be sufficient to cover claims arising from
such events. Significant damage or destruction to one of our facilities may also result in the
termination of the concession, and if we were deemed to be at fault for the damage we may
be obligated to rebuild the facility without compensation. Additionally, such events could cause
interruptions in our monitoring or other information technology systems, which could
materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_Adverse litigation judgments or settlements resulting from legal proceedings in which we may_**
**_be involved in the normal course of our business could materially adversely affect our_**
**_business, results of operations or financial condition._**
In the normal course of business, we are involved in various legal proceedings. Such litigation
may result from injuries or property damage to our customers or their property while using our
facilities, from claims arising against us relating to construction at our facilities or breach of
applicable laws and regulations, including laws relating to personal data protection obligations.
In addition, we enter into partnerships with various business partners and are members of
trade associations and we may be jointly and severally liable for judgments or claims made
against such partners or trade associations. We may face litigation by competitors challenging
the award of a concession to us, and we may also litigate against our competitors in
connection with the bidding process. In addition, we may face litigation during the liquidation
of a contract. It is possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all such matters could
cause us to incur significant liabilities. Likewise, we may incur significant legal and other costs
in connection with defending our interests in ongoing legal proceedings. Any significant
adverse litigation judgments or settlements could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_We are subject to changes in tax laws, tax rates and their application and interpretation in the_**
**_markets in which we operate, and we have been (and may continue to be) subject to_**
**_significant claims related to tax disputes and audits._**
Our operations that are profit making are subject to profit and income tax and other
applicable taxes, such as property tax. There is no guarantee that tax laws or tax rates may not
be changed in the future. Any change in tax laws or tax rates may increase our tax expenses
and liabilities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or
financial condition. We are subject to various tax proceedings and audits with tax authorities in
respect of our operations.

Between June 10, 2015 and July 26, 2017, we were subject to a tax audit process (the ‘‘Audit’’)
by the Spanish tax authority. The Audit reviewed the Group’s liabilities in respect of corporate
income tax for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2011; value added tax for the period
between January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011; and withholding taxes for the period between
May 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011. The Audit resulted in (i) a finding of e1.3 million in unpaid
taxes, including late payment interest (approximately e0.8 million related to corporate income
tax (‘‘CIT’’) and e0.5 million related to value added tax (‘‘VAT’’)), and (ii) the imposition of
penalties amounting to e4.7 million in respect of corporate income tax (the ‘‘CIT Penalty’’) and
e0.2 million in respect of VAT obligations (the ‘‘VAT Penalty’’).

On August 2017, we appealed the CIT and VAT unpaid taxes claimed before the Central
Economic and Administrative Court. On September 17, 2018 the case was brought forward and
on October 11, 2018 the allegations were presented with no response to date. Consequently,
we filed the subsequent judicial appeal with regards CIT to the Spanish High Court and are
awaiting instruction to make submissions.

55


-----

Likewise, we appealed the VAT Penalty and CIT Penalty on March 20, 2018 before the Central
Economic and Aministrative Court and on October 11, 2018, the allegations were presented
with no response to date. Consequently, we have filed the subsequent judicial appeal to the
Spanish High Court, and are awaiting instruction to make submissions. To the extent that the
relevant amounts of unpaid taxes and penalties have been already paid, in the event that we
are successful in our appeals, these amounts would be reimbursed to us with interest. If our
appeals prove unsuccessful, we may be held liable for additional tax payments. Given the
uncertainty created by the tax assessment result until the appeals are resolved, we filed
supplementary tax returns making the corresponding CIT adjustments for the 2012 to 2016
periods and VAT adjustments for the fourth quarter of 2013 through to 2017. The amendment
procedure for the supplementary returns will run in parallel to the appeal process described
above.

As of September 30, 2019, the total amount paid for this regularization is e21.8 million
(comprising e16.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, e1.0 million during the
year ended December 31, 2018, and e4.7 million during the nine months ended September 30,
2019). This regularization amount is covered through a seller indemnity in the acquisition
agreement with respect to the Empark Acquisition. e39.9 million has been placed into an
escrow account to cover these costs. This may be reimbursed to us, in full or in part, if the
assessment is overruled. However, if we become subject to other investigations, we may be
held liable for additional tax payments, including penalties and interest for late payments,
which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
operations, or our cash flows in the period or periods for which that assessment is made.

**_Our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that we could suffer_**
**_and our insurance costs may increase._**
We maintain a portfolio of insurance policies to help protect us against loss or damage
incurred from a wide variety of insurable risks. Each year, we review with our professional
insurance advisers whether the insurance policies and associated coverage that we maintain are
sufficient to adequately protect us from the various types of risk to which we are exposed.
That analysis takes into account various pertinent factors, such as the likelihood that we would
incur a material loss from any given risk, as well as the cost of obtaining insurance coverage
against any such risk. In addition, under the relevant Spanish laws, the operator of a parking
facility is liable for any damages to the vehicle and its contents. The provider of parking
services is liable for movable components, accessories or objects when certain conditions are
met, including that such movable components, accessories or objects are expressly declared by
the user, that the provider of parking services expressly accepts their custody, and that the user
complies with security measures. Under Portuguese Law, although the provider of parking
services may be generally held liable for damages to vehicles and their attachments, the nature
of such liability and the legal requirements applicable thereto depend on the law deemed as
applicable as well as the contractual relationship between the parking services provider and its
customers. Notwithstanding our insurance coverage for all or any of these risks, we may
experience one or more material losses for which we do not maintain any or adequate
insurance coverage that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or
financial condition.

**_Our business is dependent upon key personnel._**
Our success has been, and will continue to be, substantially dependent upon the continued
services of our senior management team. The loss of the services of one or more of the
members of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations or financial condition. We have entered into employment
agreements with, and historically have been successful in retaining the services of, our senior
management, there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain them in the future and
any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations

56


-----

or financial condition. We do not have any key man life insurance in place. In addition, our
continued growth depends upon our ability to attract and retain skilled operating managers
and employees. An inability to attract and retain qualified members or key personnel in due
time could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, operating results and
financial position.

**_The interests of our principal shareholder may not correspond with your interests as a holder_**
**_of the Notes._**
Funds affiliated with the Sponsor own 100% of the Company. See ‘‘Principal Shareholder.’’ As a
result, funds affiliated with the Sponsor have, directly or indirectly, the power to affect, among
other things, our legal and capital structure and our day-to-day operations, as well as the
ability to elect and change our management and to approve other changes to our operations.
In addition, for compliance with certain restrictive covenants, we depend upon the cooperation
of our principal shareholder who has the power to effect compliance with such covenants. The
interests of our shareholder could conflict with the interests of the holders of the Notes,
particularly if we encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay our debts when due.

Our shareholder may also have interests in pursuing acquisitions, disposals and other
transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their equity investment, even though these
transactions might involve risks to holders of the Notes. Our shareholder also may disagree
over key decisions affecting our business, and such material disagreements could entitle the
shareholder to exercise any exit rights provided for under the Shareholder Agreement
described under ‘‘Principal Shareholder’’ or could otherwise materially adversely affect our
business, results of operations or financial condition.

The Sponsor and its affiliated funds are in the business of making investments in companies
and may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, financing or other transactions
that, in their judgment, could enhance their equity investment, even though such transactions
might involve risks to you as holders of the Notes. In addition, the Sponsor and its affiliated
funds may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete, directly or
indirectly, with us.

## Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness

**_Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could adversely affect our business and_**
**_prevent us from fulfilling our obligations with respect to the Notes and the Note Guarantees._**

We are, and following the Offering we will continue to be, highly leveraged. As of
September 30, 2019, after giving pro forma effect to the issuance of the Notes and the
Redemption, we would have had total outstanding indebtedness of e643.4 million, including
the Notes. The Indenture will allow us to incur substantial additional indebtedness, including in
respect of committed borrowings of up to e100 million under the Revolving Credit Facility
which, as of the date of this offering memorandum, we do not expect to draw on the Issue
Date.

The degree to which we will be leveraged following the issuance of the Notes could have
important consequences to holders of the Notes offered hereby, including, but not limited to:

- making it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes;

- increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse
economic and industry conditions;

- requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the
payment of interest on our indebtedness and the repayment of principal, thereby reducing
the availability of such cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, joint ventures
or other general corporate purposes;

57


-----

- limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the
competitive environment and the industry in which we operate;

- restricting us from exploiting business opportunities or making acquisitions or investments;

- placing us at a competitive disadvantage as compared to our competitors, to the extent that
they are not as highly leveraged; and

- limiting our ability to borrow additional funds and increasing the cost of any such
borrowing.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our
ability to satisfy our debt obligations, including the Notes.

**_We are subject to restrictive debt covenants that may limit our ability to finance our future_**
**_operations and capital needs and to pursue business opportunities and activities._**
The Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contain covenants that impose
significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These agreements limit our ability to,
among other things:

- incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred stock;

- create or incur certain liens;

- make certain payments, including dividends or other distributions, with respect to the shares
of the Parent Guarantor;

- prepay or redeem subordinated debt or equity;

- make certain investments;

- create encumbrances or restrictions on the payment of dividends or other distributions, loans
or advances to and on the transfer of assets to the Parent Guarantor or its restricted
subsidiaries;

- sell, lease or transfer certain assets including stock of restricted subsidiaries;

- consolidate or merge with other entities;

- impair the security interests for the benefit of the holders of the Notes; and

- amend certain documents.

All these limitations will be subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. The covenants
to which we are subject could limit our ability to finance our future operations and capital
needs and our ability to pursue business opportunities and activities that may be in our
interest.

In addition, we will be subject to the affirmative and negative covenants contained in the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. In particular, if the sum of outstanding amounts drawn
under the Revolving Credit Facility (excluding any utilizations of letters of credit, bank
guarantees, ancillary facilities, amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility drawn on or prior to
the Issue Date and amounts drawn to fund the payment of any original issue discount and
other payments, fees, costs or expenses), minus any cash and cash equivalent investments held
by the Group, exceeds 40.0% of the total commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility and
any Incremental Facilities on an applicable quarter date (adjusted to disregard any reduction or
cancellation of such total commitments at any time after the Issue Date), the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement requires us to maintain a minimum specified consolidated net leverage
ratio, tested quarterly. Our ability to meet this financial covenant, and other affirmative and
negative covenants contained in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, may be affected by

58


-----

events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will satisfy them. A breach of
any of these provisions could result in a draw stop or an event of default under the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement. Upon the occurrence of any event of default under the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement, subject to applicable cure rights and periods and other limitations
on acceleration or enforcement, the lenders could cancel the availability of the Revolving
Credit Facility and elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility,
together with accrued interest, immediately due and payable. In addition, any default under
the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement could lead to an event of default and acceleration
under other debt instruments that contain cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions,
including the Indenture and the Notes. If our creditors, including the creditors under the
Revolving Credit Facility, accelerate the payment of those amounts, we cannot assure you that
our assets would be sufficient to repay in full those amounts, to satisfy all other liabilities
which would become due and payable and/or to make payments to enable the Issuer to repay
the Notes, in full or in part.

In addition, if we are unable to repay such amounts, our creditors could proceed to enforce
their security rights against any Collateral granted to them to secure repayment of such
amounts. See ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Revolving Credit Facility.’’

**_We will require a significant amount of cash to service our debt and sustain our operations,_**
**_which we may not be able to generate or raise. Our ability to generate sufficient cash_**
**_depends on many factors beyond our control._**
Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt, and to fund working capital and
capital expenditures, will depend on our future operating performance and ability to generate
sufficient cash. This depends, to some extent, on the success of our business strategy and on
general economic, financial, competitive, market, legislative, regulatory and other factors, as
well as the other factors discussed in these ‘‘Risk Factors,’’ many of which are beyond our
control.

We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations,
that we will realize revenue growth and operating improvements that we anticipate or that
future debt and equity financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to
pay our debts when due, including the Notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs.

If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources (including borrowings
under the Revolving Credit Facility) are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to
fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to:

- reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditures;

- sell assets;

- obtain additional debt or equity capital; or

- restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before
maturity.

The type, timing and terms of any future financing will depend on our cash needs and the
prevailing conditions in the financial markets. We cannot assure you that we would be able to
accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all. In
addition, the terms of our Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Indenture and any
future debt may limit our ability to pursue any of these measures.

Any failure to make payments on our indebtedness, including the Notes, on a timely basis
would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could also harm our ability to
incur additional indebtedness. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates
and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our
business, results of operations or financial condition. There can be no assurance that any assets
which we could be required to dispose of could be sold or that, if sold, the timing of such sale
and the amount of proceeds realized from such sale will be on a timely basis or in a sufficient
amount.

59

**_Despite our current level of indebtedness, we may still be able to incur substantially more_**
**_debt in the future, which will support our growth strategy but may make it difficult for us to_**
**_service our debt, including the Notes, and impair our ability to operate our businesses._**
We will be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Although the
Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will contain restrictions on the
incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions will be subject to a number of
significant qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances the amount of
indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with those restrictions could be substantial.
In addition, the Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will allow us to incur
certain obligations that do not constitute indebtedness under those agreements.

**_The loans under our Revolving Credit Facility and the Floating Rate Notes will bear interest at_**
**_floating rates that could rise significantly, increasing our financing costs and reducing our cash_**
**_flow._**
The Floating Rate Notes and any Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility will bear
interest at a variable rate which is based on EURIBOR (with a 0% floor) plus an applicable
margin. Fluctuations in EURIBOR or the occurrence of a market disruption event may increase
our overall interest burden and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to service
our debt obligations. We do not currently intend to enter into any new interest rate swaps
with respect to the Revolving Credit Facility or the Floating Rate Notes. To the extent that
EURIBOR were to increase significantly, our interest expense would correspondingly increase,
thereby reducing our cash flow.

## Risks Relating to Our Structure

**_The Issuer is a special purpose financing vehicle that has no revenue generating operations of_**
**_its own and will depend on cash from the operating companies of the Group to be able to_**
**_make payments on the Notes._**
The Issuer is a private limited liability company that was formed for the purposes of facilitating
the offering of the Existing Notes and any subsequent offerings, including the Offering, and
related financing activities. The Issuer is a special purpose financing vehicle with no business
operations, assets or activities, other than those related to its formation, the offering of the
Existing Notes and any subsequent offerings, including the Offering, and related financing
activities. The Issuer will therefore be dependent upon the cash flow from the operating
subsidiaries of the Group in the form of interest payments on intercompany loans or other
payments to meet its obligations, including its obligations under the Notes. The obligations of
the Guarantors under intercompany loans will be subordinated in right of payment to certain
existing and future senior indebtedness of such Guarantors, including obligations under the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. Moreover in case of insolvency of any of the Spanish
Guarantors, its obligations under the intercompany loans will be subordinated by operation of
law to any secured or unsecured claims. If the Guarantors do not distribute cash to the Issuer
to make scheduled payments on the Notes, the Issuer will not have any other source of funds
that would allow it to make payments to the holders of the Notes. The Guarantors may not,
however, be able to, or may not be permitted under applicable law to make upstream
payments or advance upstream loans to their shareholders (including the Issuer) to make
payments in respect of our indebtedness, including the Notes. In particular they are not able to
make any payment in respect of acquisition indebtedness. The subsidiaries of the Company that
do not guarantee the Notes have no obligation to make payments with respect to the Notes.

**_Midco’s ability to meet its obligations under the Proceeds Loans may be affected by a number_**
**_of factors._**
The Issuer’s ability to meet its obligations under the Notes depends on Midco meeting its
obligations to the Issuer under the Proceeds Loans. In turn, Midco’s ability to meet its
obligations under the Proceeds Loans depends on its ability to upstream cash from Empark and

60


-----

its subsidiaries. Midco has on-lent the proceeds of Proceeds Loans,, and may on-lend some or
all of the proceeds from any new Proceeds Loans drawn on or after the Issue Date, to the
Parent Guarantor, Empark or certain of its subsidiaries. Accordingly, any factor affecting the
ability of Empark and/or relevant subsidiaries to meet their debt service obligations under
those on-loans will affect Midco’s capacity to meet its obligations to the Issuer under the
Proceeds Loans, which in turn would affect the Issuer’s ability to meet its obligations under the
Notes. The ability of Empark to make distributions depends on a number of factors, including
the existence of distributable profits at Empark.

**_The Notes will each be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of non-Guarantor_**
**_subsidiaries._**
Some, but not all, members of the Group will guarantee the Notes. The Guarantors generated
83.7% and 85.6% of the Group’s Adjusted Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA, respectively, for the
twelve months ended September 30, 2019, and held 90.2% of the Group’s total assets (and
87.9% of the Group’s tangible and intangible assets, excluding goodwill) as of September 30,
2019, in each case excluding our non-wholly owned subsidiaries and our Non-Recourse Entities.
For the twelve months ended September 30, 2019, our non-wholly owned subsidiaries and our
Non-Recourse Entities, collectively, generated 18.4% of Adjusted Revenue and 14.4% of
Adjusted EBITDA, and held 11.7% of total assets (and 12.3% of tangible and intangible assets,
excluding goodwill) as of September 30, 2019. Our non-Guarantor subsidiaries generated 16.3%
and 14.4% of the Group’s Adjusted Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA, respectively, for the twelve
months ended September 30, 2019, and held 9.8% of the Group’s total assets (and 12.1% of
the Group’s tangible and intangible assets, excluding goodwill) as of September 30, 2019, in
each case excluding our non-wholly owned subsidiaries and our Non-Recourse Entities. Certain
of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries are not wholly owned.

Unless a company is a Guarantor, such company will not have any obligation to pay amounts
due under the Notes or to make funds available for that purpose. Generally, holders of
indebtedness of, and trade creditors of, non-Guarantor subsidiaries, including lenders under
our Project Finance Facilities and bank financing agreements, are entitled to payments of their
claims from the assets of such subsidiaries before these assets are made available for
distribution to any Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder. As of September 30, 2019,
after giving pro forma effect to the issuance of the Notes and the Redemption, the
non-Guarantor subsidiaries had e53.6 million (excluding accrued interest and amortized costs)
of Gross debt outstanding (comprising Project Finance Facilities) which would be structurally
senior to the Notes.

Accordingly, in the event that any non-Guarantor subsidiary becomes insolvent, is liquidated,
reorganized or dissolved or is otherwise wound up other than as part of a solvent transaction:

- the creditors of the Issuer (including the holders of the Notes) and the Guarantors will have
no right to proceed against the assets of such subsidiary; and

- creditors of such non-Guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors, will generally be
entitled to payment in full from the sale or other disposal of the assets of such subsidiary
before any Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder, will be entitled to receive any
distributions from such subsidiary.

As such, the Notes and each Note Guarantee will be structurally subordinated to the creditors
(including trade creditors) and any preferred stockholders of non-Guarantor subsidiaries.

## Risks Relating to the Notes

**_The enforcement of the Collateral may be restricted by Spanish law._**
The Collateral will be subject to any and all limitations, exceptions, defects, encumbrances,
liens, loss of legal perfection and other imperfections permitted under the Indenture and the

61


-----

Revolving Credit Facility and accepted by other creditors that have the benefit of a pari passu
security interest in the relevant Collateral from time to time. The existence of any such
exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the
value of the Collateral, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on
such Collateral.

On the Issue Date, the obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be secured
on a first-ranking basis by the Issue Date Collateral. Within 60 days of the Issue Date, the
obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be secured on a first-ranking basis
by the Post-Closing Collateral. The security interests in this Collateral will also secure our
obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging obligations on a pari passu
basis. The Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will also permit the Collateral
to be pledged to secure additional indebtedness in accordance with the terms thereof and of
the Intercreditor Agreement.

No statutory provision of Spanish Law regulates the possibility of creating concurrently more
than a single pledge over the same assets or right (either with the same or with different
ranking). In this respect, we are of the opinion, together with a relevant number of scholars,
that the creation of two or more pledges over a certain asset or right is legally possible and
that, similarly, such pledges may rank pari passu amongst themselves, except for pledges
governed by Article 569.15 of the Catalan Law on In Rem Rights, which expressly prohibits
second and subsequent pledges if not granted in favor of the same secured creditors. Such
opinion is based on the Spanish mortgage laws and regulations (normativa hipotecaria), even
though it should be pointed out that this opinion is not unanimously supported by the scholars
and that there is, to the best of our knowledge, no case law either for or against the
analogical application of the mortgage legal principles to the ordinary pledge (prenda com´un).
Therefore, although there are grounds to sustain the effectiveness of concurrent and/or second
ranking pledges governed by Spanish law other than Catalan Law on In Rem Rights, it cannot
be disregarded that a court may take a different view and consider such pledges ineffective
and not admissible in Spain.

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the liabilities under the Revolving Credit Facility and
certain hedging obligations will have priority over the Notes with respect to amounts received
from the sale of the Collateral as a result of an enforcement action (acci´on ejecutiva) with
respect to the Collateral. As such, in the event of a foreclosure of the Collateral, holders of the
Notes will receive less from the proceeds of security in an enforcement or insolvency scenario
than if they were not required to share the proceeds. Moreover, holders of the Notes may not
be able to recover on the Collateral if the then outstanding claims under the Revolving Credit
Facility and such amount in respect of priority hedging obligations are greater than the
proceeds realized.

Any proceeds from an enforcement sale of the Collateral by any creditor will, after all priority
obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and such amount in respect of such hedging
obligations have been discharged from such recoveries, be applied pro rata in repayment of
the Notes and any other obligations ranking pari passu with the Notes and secured by the
Collateral. The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that a common Security Agent, who will
also serve as the security agent for the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility, hedging
obligations and any additional secured debt permitted to be incurred by the Indenture or the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, will act only as provided for in the Intercreditor
Agreement. In general, the facility agent under the Revolving Credit Facility and any agent
with respect to any permitted future secured debt will have, subject to certain restrictions in
connection with, among others, the ability to provide enforcement instructions to the Security
Agent and the right to enforce the shared Collateral.

The enforcement of the Collateral governed by Spanish law will be subject to practical
problems generally associated with the realization of collateral under Spanish law. For example,

62


-----

the Security Agent may need to obtain the consent of a third party to enforce a security
interest. The Security Agent may not be able to obtain any such consent or promptly satisfy
such requirements. The consent of any third party may not be given when required to facilitate
a foreclosure on such asset. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to
foreclose upon that asset, and the value of the Collateral may, as a consequence, significantly
decrease.

Unless the pledges over shares benefit from the application of Royal Decree Law 5/2005
(‘‘RDL 5/2005’’), the beneficiaries have the right to be reimbursed with the proceeds obtained
from the sale in a public auction of the relevant pledged shares and to act themselves as
bidders in such public auction without their having the right to appropriate those pledged
shares or to conduct private sales thereof.

In order for this Collateral to benefit from the application of the RDL 5/2005, it is required
that:

(i) the Collateral assets must be either: (i) cash, (ii) negotiable securities (‘‘valores negociables’’)
or other financial instruments as defined in the Market Securities Law, or (iii) certain claims
arising from loans granted by banks. While some scholars have supported that unlisted
securities (such as the pledged shares) fall beyond the scope of RDL 5/2005, as there is no
case-law on this issue to date, our opinion is that unlisted shares could be the object of a
financial collateral arrangement thereunder and that, accordingly, the Collateral may
satisfy this requirement;

(ii) the relevant collateral assets are in the ‘‘possession’’ or ‘‘control’’ (as such terms are used in
the RDL 5/2005) of the collateral taker. RDL 5/2005 is silent on the meaning of ‘‘possession’’
and ‘‘control.’’ However, it should be noted that on November 10, 2016 the Court of Justice
of the European Union gave its first ruling on the scope of the FCD following a referral on
questions of EU law from the Supreme Court of Latvia (Case C-156/15). The judgment, in
respect of monies held in an ordinary bank account, in part addressed the issues of
‘‘possession’’ and ‘‘control.’’ The court indicated that the collateral taker may be regarded
as having acquired ‘possession or control’ of the monies credited to the account only if the
collateral-provider is prevented from disposing of them. The court further indicated that
for the collateral-provider to be prevented from disposing of the monies a clause would be
required which restricted the collateral provider from doing so.

Accordingly, it is most likely that Spanish Courts will find that no collateral taker is under
the possession or control of the collateral unless it has the contractual right to prevent the
collateral provider at any time from dealing with, or disposing of, it. and

(iii) either of the parties thereof is an entity of any of the categories listed in Article 4 of
RDL 5/2005 (a ‘‘Qualifying Entity’’). In this respect, a Qualifying Entity would be (a) public
authorities; (b) the European Central Bank, the Bank of Spain, a central bank of any
Member State of the European Union, a central bank of any third States, the Bank for
International Settlements, a multilateral development bank, the International Monetary
Fund and the European Investment Bank; (c) a credit institution, an investment firm, an
insurance undertaking, an undertaking for collective investment in transferable securities
or a management company thereof, a fondo de titulizaci´on de activos (‘‘non-mortgage
_securitisation fund’’) or a fondo de titulizaci´on de hipotecaria (‘‘mortgage securitisation_
_fund’’) or a management company thereof, a pension fund, or any other financial_
institutions defined in Article 1(4) of Directive 2006/48/EC of the European Parliament and
of the Council, of June 14, 2006, relating to the taking up and pursuit of the business of
credit institutions; or (d) a governing body of a secondary exchange, a governing body of a
clearing and settlement system, or a central counterparty, a settlement agent or a clearing
house as defined in Law 41/1999, of November 12, on Payment and Securities Settlement
Systems, or a similar institution acting in the futures, options and derivatives markets, and

63


-----

the members and participants of those markets’ infrastructures where acting in such
capacity.

Each security interest granted over the Collateral will be limited in scope to the lesser of (i) the
value of the relevant assets expressed to be subject to that security interest, and (ii) the
maximum amount secured by the security interest, and enforcement of each Security and
Guarantee Document would be subject to certain generally available defenses. These laws and
defenses include those that relate to corporate benefit, fraudulent conveyance or transfer,
voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate interest, capital maintenance or similar
laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. As regards financial
assistance, Spanish Collateral will not secure any obligations which implies a breach of Spanish
financial assistance regulations. See ‘‘Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the
_Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations’’ and ‘‘Description of_
_Notes—Security.’’_

Furthermore, Spanish insolvency law imposes a moratorium on the enforcement of secured
creditor’s rights (in rem security) in the event of insolvency that are necessary for the
continuation of the debtor’s business activity. The moratorium would take effect following the
declaration of insolvency until the earlier of (i) one year from the declaration of the insolvency
if the insolvent company has not been placed in liquidation, (ii) the date the creditors reach an
agreement that does not affect the exercise of the rights granted by the security interest, with
the limitations explained above, or (iii) the Insolvency Judge confirms that the relevant assets
or rights subject to security are not necessary for the debtor´s business activity.

For more information, see ‘‘Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and
_the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.’’_

**_Spanish insolvency laws may differ from and be less favorable than the bankruptcy laws or_**
**_insolvency law of other jurisdiction._**
Empark and other Subsidiary Guarantors are organized under the laws of Spain, and their
‘‘center of main interests’’ is located in Spain. There is a rebuttable presumption that the
‘‘center of main interest’’ as defined in Regulation (EU) No. 2015/848 of the European
Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015 on Insolvency Proceedings (the ‘‘EU Insolvency
_Regulation’’), as well as in the Spanish Insolvency Law 22/2003, as amended (the ‘‘Spanish_
_Insolvency Law’’), is the jurisdiction where the registered office is situated. Accordingly, any_
insolvency proceedings against Empark or the Spanish Guarantors would likely be based on
Spanish insolvency laws. The insolvency laws of Spain may not be as favorable to holders of the
Notes as the laws of the United States or some other jurisdictions, and certain provisions of
Spanish insolvency law could affect the ranking of the Notes and the Guarantees or claims
relating to the Notes and the Guarantees (including enforcement claims) on an insolvency of
the Spanish Guarantors.

The Spanish Insolvency Law also foresees a pre-insolvency mechanism whereby the debtor may
file at court the communication foreseen under Article 5 bis which provides it with a total of
four additional months to, amongst other things, reach an agreement with its main creditors
which may allow the debtor to rectify its situation and thus avoid filing for insolvency.

In particular, under Spanish law, a creditor’s rights will be subordinated to the preferential and
ordinary debts of a debtor in an insolvency proceeding if such creditor is determined to be a
‘‘specially related’’ party to the debtor. Additionally, under Spanish law payments made under
an equitably subordinated loan preceding the bankruptcy of an obligor may in certain
circumstances be clawed back.

For more information, see ‘‘Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and
_the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.’’_

**_Creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging liabilities will be entitled to_**
**_be repaid in full with the proceeds of the Collateral sold in any enforcement sale in priority to_**
**_the Notes._**
The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the Security Agent shall act on instructions
provided by Majority Super Senior Creditors (as defined under ‘‘Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement—Security enforcement’’) and the Majority Senior_
Secured Creditors (as defined under ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
_Intercreditor Agreement—Security enforcement’’). The Security Agent will act in accordance_
with enforcement instructions received from the Majority Super Senior Creditors and Majority
Senior Secured Creditors; provided, however, that the Security Agent will act in accordance
with enforcement instructions received from the Majority Super Senior Creditors if (a) the
obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility have not been fully discharged within six
months of the end of the Consultation Period, (b) enforcement has not commenced within
three months of the end of the Consultation Period or (c) an Insolvency Event (as defined in
the Intercreditor Agreement) occurs in respect of any Debtor, Third Party Chargor or other
member of the Group. See ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor
_Agreement—Security enforcement.’’ The lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility, certain_
hedging counterparties or lenders of any other future class of debt that ranks pari passu with
the indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility may have interests that are different from
the interests of holders of the Notes and they may, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement, elect to pursue their remedies under the Security and Guarantee Documents at a
time when it would be disadvantageous for the holders of the Notes to do so.

**_The Notes will be secured only to up to the lesser of (a) the extent of the value of the_**
**_Collateral that has been granted as security for the Notes and the Note Guarantees and_**
**_(b) the maximum guaranteed or secured amount, and such security may not be sufficient to_**
**_satisfy the obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees._**
If there is an event of default on the Notes, the holders of the Notes will be secured only to
the lesser of (a) extent of the value of the Collateral granted as security for the Notes and
(b) the maximum guaranteed or secured amount as a consequence of legal limitations such as
financial assistance or corporate benefit amongst others. In particular, the maximum secured
amount under the Collateral granted by Empark, Dornier and Maksu will be limited to the
value of the Amended and Restated Debt Repayment Proceeds Loan and certain cash proceeds
of the Offering retained at Midco (which in total is expected to be approximately
e460 million—except for the security over the Collateral over the issued and outstanding shares
of Emparque, which maximum secured amount will, in connection with Portuguese stamp tax
issues, be limited to e40 million—and will not secure those obligations or liabilities which, if
secured, will constitute an infringement of Spanish financial assistance laws in accordance with
Articles 143.2 and 150 of the Spanish Companies Act (see ‘‘—Spanish Guarantee and Collateral
_Limitations’’). Not all our assets secure the Notes. In the future, the obligations to provide_
additional guarantees and grant additional security over assets, or a particular type or class of
assets, whether as a result of the acquisition or creation of future assets or subsidiaries, the
designation of a previously unrestricted subsidiary as a restricted subsidiary or otherwise, will
be subject to the Indenture, the Agreed Security Principles and the Intercreditor Agreement.
The Agreed Security Principles (as set out in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) will set
out a number of limitations on the rights of the holders of the Notes to require granting of, or
payment or enforcement under, a guarantee or security in certain circumstances. Accordingly,
the Agreed Security Principles may affect the value of the guarantees and security to be
provided by us and our subsidiaries. The terms of the security documents securing obligations
under the Notes and applicable guarantee limitations may result in, among other things, the
amount recoverable under any guarantee or security provided by any subsidiary being limited
or security not being granted over a particular type or class of assets. Accordingly, the Agreed
Security Principles may affect the value of the guarantees and security provided by us and our
subsidiaries. The validity and enforceability of the guarantees and security may also be affected

65


-----

by local law limitations. See ‘‘—Certain of the Note Guarantees will be limited to a specified
_amount, and each Note Guarantee will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and_
_may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and_
_enforceability.’’_

On the Issue Date, the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be secured on a first-ranking basis
by the Issue Date Collateral. Within 60 days of the Issue Date, the Notes and the Note
Guarantees will also be secured on a first-ranking basis by the Post-Closing Collateral. For
further information see ‘‘Description of Notes—Security.’’ No appraisals of any Collateral have
been prepared, and there is no requirement to provide funds to enhance the value of the
Collateral if it is insufficient. The proceeds of any sale of the Collateral following an event of
default with respect to the Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy, and may be substantially less
than, amounts due on the Notes.

The value of the Collateral and the amount to be received upon an enforcement of such
Collateral will depend upon many factors, including whether or not our business is sold as a
going concern, the jurisdiction in which the enforcement action or sale is completed, the ability
to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, economic conditions where operations are located and
the availability of buyers. Further, there may not be any buyer willing and able to purchase our
business as a going concern, or willing to buy the Collateral in the event of an enforcement
action. The Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value.

By its nature, some or all the Collateral may not have a readily ascertainable market value or
may not be saleable or, if saleable, there may be substantial delays in its disposal. To the extent
that other first-priority security interests, pre-existing liens, liens permitted under the Indenture
or the Revolving Credit Facility and other rights encumber the Collateral securing the Notes,
those parties may have or may exercise rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral that
could adversely affect the value of the Collateral and the ability of the Security Agent to
realize or foreclose on the Collateral. There may also be other practical problems generally
associated with the realization of security interests in the Collateral. For example, under
Luxembourg law, the enforcement of share pledges, whether by means of a sale or an
appropriation, is subject to certain specific requirements. The Security Agent may also need to
obtain a power of attorney from the beneficiaries of the Collateral or the consent of a third
party to enforce a security interest. We cannot assure you that the Security Agent will be able
to obtain any such powers of attorney or consent. We also cannot assure you that the consents
of any third parties will be given when required to facilitate a sale of, or foreclosure on, such
assets.

Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to sell or foreclose upon those assets,
and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease.

If the proceeds of any sale of Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the
Notes and the Note Guarantees, holders of the Notes (to the extent not repaid from the
proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would have only an unsecured claim against the Issuer’s
and the Guarantors’ remaining assets. Each of these factors or any challenge to the validity of
the Collateral or the intercreditor arrangements governing our creditors’ rights could reduce
the proceeds realized upon enforcement of the Collateral. In addition, there can be no
assurance that the Collateral could be sold in a timely manner, if at all. Proceeds from
enforcement sales of the Collateral must be applied in satisfaction of certain priority
obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties under certain hedging
obligations (and any other future indebtedness that ranks pari passu with the Revolving Credit
Facility and such hedging obligations) before being applied to repay on a pari passu basis the
obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Notes and any other pari passu debt. In
addition, the Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will allow the incurrence
of certain additional permitted debt in the future that is secured by the Collateral on a priority
or pari passu basis.

**_Certain of the Note Guarantees will be limited to a specified amount, and each Note_**
**_Guarantee will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by_**
**_applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability._**
Each Note Guarantee provides the holders of the Notes with a claim through the Trustee
against the relevant Guarantor. However, (a) the Note Guarantees of Empark,Dornier
Estacionamientos Alh ´ondiga, Empark Andaluc´ıa, Aparcamientos de Bilbao and Maksu will be
limited to the value of the Amended and Restated Debt Repayment Proceeds Loan and certain
cash proceeds of the Offering retained at Midco (which is expected in total to be
approximately e460 million, and will reflect certain limitations in order not to guarantee those
obligations or liabilities which, if guaranteed, will constitute an infringement of Spanish
financial assistance laws in accordance with Articles 143.2 and 150 of the Spanish Companies
Act or an infringement of any other applicable legal limitation (see ‘‘—Spanish Guarantee and
_Collateral Limitations’’) and (b), the Note Guarantees of the Portuguese Guarantors will not_
guarantee those obligations or liabilities which, if guaranteed, will constitute an infringement
of Portuguese financial assistance laws in accordance with Article 322 of the Portuguese
Companies Code, approved by Decree Law 262/86 of September 2. In order to avoid Portuguese
financial assistance issues, the Note Guarantees of Emparque and Esli will be limited part of the
value of the Amended and Restated Debt Repayment Proceeds Loan (which, in connection with
Portuguese stamp tax issues, is expected to be e29.97 million and e25.32 million, respectively).

The Indenture will provide that each Note Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount
that can be guaranteed by the relevant Guarantor without rendering the relevant Note
Guarantee, as it relates to that Guarantor, voidable or otherwise ineffective or limited under
applicable law, and enforcement of each Note Guarantee would be subject to certain generally
available defenses. In particular, as regards guarantees provided by Spanish Guarantors and
Portuguese Guarantors, their guarantees will not guarantee any obligations which imply a
breach of, respectively, Spanish or Portuguese financial assistance regulations. Enforcement of
any of the Note Guarantees against any Guarantor will be subject to certain defenses available
to Guarantors in the relevant jurisdiction. Although laws differ among these jurisdictions, these
laws and defenses generally include those that relate to financial assistance, corporate interest
or benefit, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, insolvency or bankruptcy
challenges, preservation of share capital, thin capitalization, capital maintenance or similar
laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. If one or more of these
laws and defenses is applicable, a Guarantor may have no liability or decreased liability under
its Note Guarantee depending on the amounts of its other obligations and applicable law.
Limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in New York courts in such jurisdictions
could limit the enforceability of any Note Guarantee against any Guarantor.

Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under bankruptcy or insolvency
law and other laws, a court could (i) avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s
obligations under its Note Guarantee, (ii) direct that the holders of the Notes return any
amounts paid under a Note Guarantee to the relevant Guarantor or to a fund for the benefit
of the Guarantor’s creditors; (iii) take other action that is detrimental to you or (iv) subordinate
the payment of the Guarantor’s obligations under its Note Guarantee to other obligations of
the Guarantor, typically if the court found that:

- the relevant Note Guarantee was incurred with actual intent to give preference to one
creditor over another, hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the Guarantor or,
in certain jurisdictions, when the granting of the Note Guarantee has the effect of giving a
creditor a preference or when the recipient was aware that the Guarantor was insolvent
when it granted the relevant Note Guarantee;

- the Guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value or corporate
benefit for the relevant Note Guarantee and the Guarantor was: (i) insolvent or rendered
insolvent because of the relevant Note Guarantee, (ii) undercapitalized or became

67


-----

undercapitalized because of the relevant Note Guarantee or (iii) intended to incur, or
believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity;

- the relevant Note Guarantee was held to exceed the corporate objects of the Guarantor or
not to be in the best interests or for the corporate benefit of the Guarantor or be
detrimental to the insolvency estate (under these circumstances any Note Guarantee granted
within two years in Spain or Portugal prior to a declaration of insolvency may be
unconditionally extinguished); or

- the amount paid or payable under the relevant Note Guarantee was in excess of the
maximum amount permitted under applicable law or against financial assistance laws.

These or similar laws may also apply to any future guarantee granted by any of our
subsidiaries pursuant to the Indenture.

We cannot assure you which standard a court would apply in determining whether a
Guarantor was ‘‘insolvent’’ at the relevant time or that, regardless of method of valuation, a
court would not determine that a Guarantor was insolvent on that date, or that a court would
not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor was insolvent on the date its Note
Guarantee was issued, that payments to holders of the Notes constituted preferences,
fraudulent transfers or conveyances on other grounds.

The liability of each Guarantor under its Note Guarantee will be limited to the amount that
will result in such Note Guarantee not constituting a preference, fraudulent conveyance or
improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside. However, there can be no
assurance as to what standard a court will apply in making a determination of the maximum
liability of each Guarantor. There is a possibility that the entire Note Guarantee may be set
aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished.

If a court decided that a Note Guarantee was a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance
and voided such Note Guarantee, or held it unenforceable for any other reason, you may cease
to have any claim in respect of the relevant Guarantor and would be a creditor solely of the
Issuer and, if applicable, of any other Guarantor under the relevant Note Guarantee which has
not been declared void. In the event that any Note Guarantee is invalid or unenforceable, in
whole or in part, or to the extent the agreed limitation of the Note Guarantee obligations
apply, the Notes would be effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor,
and if we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Notes or any Note Guarantee is found to be
a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you
that we can ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the Notes.

**_Spanish Guarantee and Collateral Limitations._**
Spanish law prohibits financial assistance within the meaning of (a) Article 150 of the Spanish
Companies Act in relation to any Spanish guarantor incorporated or organized as a public
limited liability company (‘‘sociedad an´onima’’) under the laws of Spain and (b) Article 143.2 of
the Spanish Companies Act in relation to any Spanish guarantor incorporated or organized as a
private limited liability company (‘‘sociedad limitada’’) under the laws of Spain. Therefore, any
guarantee, security or indemnity granted by the Spanish Guarantors shall not extend to any
payment obligation incurred by any person for the purpose of, directly or indirectly, acquiring,
financing or refinancing the acquisition of the shares or quota shares (participaciones sociales)
of such Guarantor or those of its direct or indirect parent company or, in the case of a private
limited liability company, of any company within its group. Guarantees, security or indemnities
granted in breach of the financial assistance limitations may be declared null and void, and can
result in the imposition of fines to the relevant directors of the companies committing such
infringement. All provisions of the Guarantees and Collateral shall contain the necessary
limitations to the effect that they will not guarantee or secure those obligations or liabilities
which, if guaranteed or secured, will constitute an infringement of Spanish financial assistance

laws. In addition, the Note Guarantees of Empark,Dornier Estacionamientos Alh ´ondiga, Empark
Andaluc´ıa, Aparcamientos de Bilbao and Maksu and the secured amount under Collateral
granted by Empark, Dornier and Maksu, will be limited to the value of the Amended and
Restated Debt Repayment Proceeds Loan and certain cash proceeds of the Offering retained at
Midco (which is expected in total to be approximately e460 million)—except for the security
over the Collateral over the issued and outstanding shares of Emparque, which maximum
secured amount will, in connection with Portuguese stamp tax issues, be limited to e40 million.

Finally, as regards those Spanish Guarantors that are incorporated as sociedad de
_responsabilidad limitada (initially Empark Andaluc´ıa and Maksu), it must be noted that,_
although the applicable legislation is unclear in this respect, the Note Guarantees granted by
such entities might be subject to the maximum amount applicable to the issuance of bonds by
_sociedades de responsabilidad limitada pursuant to article 401 the Corporate Companies Act_
(such limit being equal to two times the own resources (recursos propios) of the relevant
Spanish Guarantor).

See ‘‘Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral and
_Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.’’_

**_Portuguese Guarantee and Collateral Limitations._**
Under Portuguese law, claims may become time-barred (20 years being the ordinary term set
forth under article 309 of the Portuguese Civil Code) and may be or become subject to the
defense of set-off or counterclaim.

The terms ‘‘enforceable,’’ ‘‘enforceability,’’ ‘‘valid,’’ ‘‘legal,’’ ‘‘binding’’ and ‘‘effective’’ (or any
combination thereof) mean that all of the obligations assumed by the relevant party under the
relevant documents are of a type enforced by Portuguese courts; the terms do not mean that
these obligations will necessarily be enforced in all circumstances in accordance with their
terms. Enforcement before the courts will, in any event, be subject to:

- the degree to which the relevant obligations are enforceable under their governing law;

- the nature of the remedies available in the courts; and

- the availability of defenses such as (without limitation) set-off, fraud, abuse of rights (abuso
_de direito), violation of public policy principles, duress, misrepresentation, undue influence,_
conflict of interests, force majeure, exception of non adimplenti contractus (i.e. the right
afforded to a party to withhold his/her own performance until the other party has duly
performed his/her obligations under the contract), error, abatement and counterclaim.

As a general rule, under Portuguese law, any guarantee, pledge or mortgage must guarantee
or secure another obligation to which it is ancillary, which must be clearly identified in the
relevant guarantee or security agreement. Therefore, the guarantee or security interest follows
the underlying obligation in such a way that nullity of the underlying obligation entails nullity
of the guarantee or security and termination of the underlying obligation entails termination
of the guarantee or security. In the event that the security providers are able to prove that
there are no existing and valid guaranteed obligations, Portuguese courts may consider that
the security providers’ obligations under the relevant guarantees or security are not
enforceable.

Pursuant to Portuguese Law the provision of Guarantees or Collateral in favor of third parties
is not allowed, unless (i) the company has a justified corporate interest in the granting of the
Guarantees and/or of the Collateral or (ii) the company is in a group or control relationship
with the beneficiary of the Guarantees and/or of the Security (although it may be sustained
that, for these purposes, both the company and beneficiary must be domiciled in Portugal).

In addition, the obligations under Guarantees or Collateral granted by the Portuguese
Guarantors shall not extend to any use of the proceeds of the Notes used for the purpose of

69


-----

acquiring shares representing the share capital of such Guarantor or the shares of its direct or
indirect parent company, or refinancing a previous debt incurred for the acquisition of shares
representing the share capital of such Guarantor or of its direct or indirect parent company,
otherwise breaching the prohibition of financial assistance pursuant to article 322 of the
Portuguese Companies Code, approved by Decree Law 262/86 of September 2. In this respect,
all provisions of such Guarantee or Collateral shall be construed accordingly in the sense that in
no case can any Guarantee or Collateral granted by a Portuguese Guarantor secure repayment
of the above-mentioned funds.

Guarantees or indemnities granted in breach of financial assistance limitations will be
considered null and void, i.e., may have the effect of reducing the amount of the obligations
or liabilities assumed and/or the amount guaranteed or secured to zero, and may result in the
imposition of fines to the relevant directors of the companies committing the infraction.

Moreover, the Portuguese Guarantors will be entitled to claim for themselves immunity from
suit, execution, attachment or other legal process in respect of their obligations under the Note
Guarantees to the extent that their assets are covered by the immunities legally set forth,
which include, but are not limited to, assets that are part of the public domain of the
Portuguese Republic (dom´ınio p´ublico do Estado) or allocated to public service purposes.

**_The Security Agent may be required to pay certain Portuguese stamp taxes on behalf of the_**
**_holders of the Notes in order to enforce the Note Guarantees and/or the Collateral over the_**
**_shares of Emparque in Portugal._**
The Note Guarantees of Emparque and Esli will be limited to e29.97 million and e25.32 million,
respectively. The maximum secured amount under the Collateral over the issued and
outstanding shares of Emparque will be limited to a e40.0 million. Under Portuguese law,
certain stamp taxes are required to be paid at the time of enforcement in Portugal with
respect to the pledge over the shares in a Portuguese entity and to guarantees granted by a
Portuguese company outside Portugal and, in any case, not presented in Portugal for any legal
purposes until that moment. The Security Agent may be required to pay stamp tax in order to
enforce the Collateral over the shares in Emparque and/or the Note Guarantees granted by the
Portuguese Guarantors at the time of such enforcement. The payment of such stamp taxes by
the Security Agent would reduce the amount recovered in the event of an enforcement action
in Portugal.

**_There are circumstances other than the repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the_**
**_Collateral securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be released automatically, without_**
**_your consent or the consent of the Trustee._**
Under various circumstances, the Collateral securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be
released automatically, including:

- in connection with any sale or other disposition of the assets provided the sale or other
disposition is in accordance with the ‘‘Asset Sale’’ provisions of the Indenture;

- if the Parent Guarantor designates any restricted subsidiary to be an unrestricted subsidiary
in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture;

- upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture as
provided under ‘‘Description of Notes—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance’’ and
‘‘Description of Notes—Satisfaction and Discharge;’’

- in accordance with the ‘‘Amendment, Supplement and Waiver’’ provisions of the Indenture;
or

- as otherwise set forth under ‘‘Description of Notes—Security—Release of Liens.’’

70


-----

In addition, under various circumstances, the Note Guarantees will be released automatically,
including:

- in connection with any sale or other disposition of all or substantially all the assets of a
Subsidiary Guarantor (including by way of merger or consolidation) to a person that is not
the Parent Guarantor or one of its restricted subsidiaries if the sale or other disposition does
not violate the ‘‘Asset Sale’’ provisions of the Indenture, and all obligations of that Subsidiary
Guarantor with respect to other Indebtedness of the Parent Guarantor and its Restricted
Subsidiaries are also released;

- in connection with any sale of all the capital stock of a Subsidiary Guarantor to a person that
is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) the Parent Guarantor or one
of its restricted subsidiaries, if the sale or other disposition does not violate the ‘‘Asset Sale’’
provisions of the Indenture, and all obligations of that Subsidiary Guarantor with respect to
other Indebtedness of the Parent Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries are also released;

- if the Parent Guarantor designates any restricted subsidiary that is a Guarantor to be an
unrestricted subsidiary in accordance with the applicable provisions of the relevant Indenture;

- upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture as
provided under ‘‘Description of Notes—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance;’’

- in accordance with the ‘‘Amendment, Supplement and Waiver’’ provisions of the Indenture;
or

- as otherwise set forth under ‘‘Description of Notes—The Guarantors.’’

In addition, the Note Guarantees and Collateral will each be subject to release upon an
enforcement sale as contemplated under the Intercreditor Agreement. See ‘‘Description of
_Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement’’ and ‘‘Description of Notes.’’_

**_The security interests in the Collateral will be granted to the Trustee or the Security Agent (as_**
**_the case may be) rather than directly to the holders of the Notes. The ability of the Security_**
**_Agent to enforce certain of the Collateral may be restricted by local law._**
The security interests in the Collateral that will secure the obligations under the Notes and the
obligations of the Guarantors under the Note Guarantees will not be granted directly to the
holders of the Notes but will be granted in favor of the Security Agent, except for the
Collateral governed by Portuguese law, which will be granted in favor of the holders of the
Notes acting through the Security Agent, and by Spanish law, which will be granted in favor of
the Trustee (acting for the benefit of the holders of the Notes).

The Indenture will provide (along with the Intercreditor Agreement) that only the Security
Agent has the right to enforce the Security and Guarantee Documents. As a consequence,
holders of the Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take
enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Trustee,
who will (subject to the provisions of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement) provide
instructions to the Security Agent in respect of the Collateral.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if enforcement of any security interest in Spain and Portugal
was to be carried out by the Security Agent in Spain and Portugal, it may be necessary to
prove that the Security Agent is duly and expressly empowered for such purpose by means of
duly notarized powers of attorney granted in favor of the Security Agent by each of the actual
or future creditors, if necessary, with the Apostille of The Hague Convention dated October 5,
1961. Therefore, there could be a delay in the execution of the Collateral in Spain and Portugal
while the Security Agent obtains such powers.

In addition, in Spain, it may be the case that for the actual enforcement of the Collateral, each
of the secured parties benefiting from such Collateral would have to evidence its title to the

71


-----

secured obligations, ratify such Collateral and accept the benefit of the security interest in their
respective names by executing a public deed through duly appointed representatives by means
of notarized and apostilled powers of attorney.

The enforcement of the Collateral governed by Portuguese law shall be made in accordance
with the procedures provided by Portuguese Decree Law no.105/2004 of May 8, as amended
from time to time, and accordingly such Collateral is a first ranking financial pledge (penhor
_financeiro) entitling the beneficiaries to appropriate the pledged shares or to conduct private_
sales thereof.

The granting of security interests in favor of a foreign security agent (acting for and on behalf
of third-party beneficiaries) would be recognized under Luxembourg law (i) to the extent that
the designation of such security agent is valid under the law governing its appointment and
(ii) subject to the type of the security interests granted. Generally, according to article 2(4) of
the Luxembourg law dated August 5, 2005 concerning financial collateral arrangements, as
amended (the ‘‘Collateral Act 2005’’), a security interest which constitutes financial collateral (in
accordance with the provisions of the Collateral Act 2005) may be provided in favor of a
person acting on behalf of the beneficiary(ies) of such security interest(s), a fiduciary or a
trustee in order to secure the claims of third-party beneficiaries, whether present or future,
provided that these third-party beneficiaries are determined or may be determined. Without
prejudice to their obligations vis-`a-vis the third party beneficiaries of the security, persons
acting on behalf of beneficiaries of the security interest(s), the fiduciary or the trustee benefit
from the same rights as those of the direct beneficiaries of the security interest(s) provided
under the Collateral Act 2005.

**_The Issuer and the Guarantors will have control over the Collateral securing the Notes, and_**
**_the sale of particular assets could reduce the pool of assets securing the Notes._**
The Security and Guarantee Documents allow the Issuer and the Guarantors to remain in
possession of, retain exclusive control over, freely operate, and collect, invest and dispose of
any income from the Collateral securing the Notes. So long as no default or event of default
under the Indenture would result therefrom, the Issuer and the Guarantors may, among other
things, without any release or consent by the Security Agent, conduct ordinary course activities
with respect to the Collateral, such as selling, factoring, abandoning or otherwise disposing of
the Collateral and making ordinary course cash payments, including repayments of
indebtedness, provided that they do not conduct any act or omission that may jeopardize the
rights that arise from the Collateral.

**_We may not be able to obtain the funds required to repurchase the Notes upon a Change of_**
**_Control._**
The Indenture will contain provisions relating to certain events constituting a ‘‘Change of
Control’’ of the Parent Guarantor. Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, we will be
required to offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes at a price equal to 101% of their
principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to
the date of repurchase. If a Change of Control were to occur, we cannot assure you that we
would have sufficient funds available at such time, or that we would have sufficient funds to
provide to the Issuer to pay the repurchase price of the outstanding Notes or that the
restrictions in our Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement or our
other than existing contractual obligations would allow us to make such required repurchases.
A Change of Control may result in a prepayment event or an event of default under, and the
acceleration of, our Revolving Credit Facility and other indebtedness. The repurchase of the
Notes pursuant to such an offer could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the
Change of Control itself does not. The ability of the Issuer to receive cash from other members
of the Group to allow the Issuer to pay cash to the holders of the Notes following the
occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by our existing financial resources. In
addition, under the terms of our Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, under certain

72


-----

circumstances, we will be required to repay a pro rata amount of debt under our Revolving
Credit Facility if we repay all or a portion of the principal under the Notes. Sufficient funds
may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. If an event
constituting a Change of Control occurs at a time when the Group is prohibited from providing
funds to the Issuer for the purpose of repurchasing the Notes, we may seek the consent of the
lenders under such indebtedness to the purchase of the Notes or may attempt to refinance the
borrowings that contain such prohibition. If such consent to repay such borrowings is not
obtained, the Issuer will remain prohibited from repurchasing any Notes, including the Notes
offered hereby. In addition, we expect that we would require third-party financing to make an
offer to repurchase the Notes upon a Change of Control. We cannot assure you that we would
be able to obtain such financing. Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes will
constitute a default under the Indenture which would, in turn, constitute a default under the
Revolving Credit Facility. See ‘‘Description of Notes—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—
_Change of Control.’’_

Further, if pursuant to a Change of Control Offer, holders of not less than 90% of the
aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw
such Notes, the Indenture will permit the Issuer, at its option, to redeem the remaining
outstanding Notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount of such Notes plus accrued and
unpaid interest. As a consequence, holders of the Notes, including the Notes offered hereby,
may be required to surrender the Notes against their will at a price equivalent to that paid to
tendering holders and may not receive the return expected.

The Change of Control provision that will be contained in the Indenture may not necessarily
afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including a
reorganization, restructuring, merger or other similar transaction involving us that may
adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or
beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a ‘‘Change of Control’’ as defined
in the Indenture. In addition, the occurrence of certain events that might otherwise constitute
a Change of Control will be deemed not to be a Change of Control if a certain consolidated
net leverage ratio calculated in accordance with the ‘‘Description of Notes’’ is not exceeded in
connection with such an event. In this case holders of notes would not be entitled to require
the Issuer to repurchase their Notes and would only be able to rely on the then prevailing
trading prices in order to exit their investments, which might be lower than the 101% Change
of Control repurchase price. See ‘‘Description of the Notes—Change of Control’’ and
‘‘Description of Notes—Certain Definitions—Specified Change of Control Event.’’ Except as
described under ‘‘Description of Notes—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change of
_Control,’’ the Indenture does not contain provisions that would require the Issuer to offer to_
repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a reorganization, restructuring, merger,
recapitalization or similar transaction.

The definition of ‘‘Change of Control’’ in the Indenture will include a disposition of all or
substantially all the assets of the Parent Guarantor and its restricted subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, to any person. Although there is a limited body of New York case law interpreting the
phrase ‘‘all or substantially all,’’ there is no precise established definition of the phrase under
applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty as
to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of ‘‘all or substantially all’’ the
Parent Guarantor’s assets and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be
unclear as to whether a change of control has occurred and whether the Issuer is required to
make an offer to repurchase the Notes.

**_The interests of holders of Floating Rate Notes and the interests of the holders of Fixed Rate_**
**_Notes may be inconsistent._**
The Floating Rate Notes and the Fixed Rate Notes will be issued pursuant to a single indenture
and will vote as a single class with respect to amendments, waivers or other modifications of

73


-----

the Indenture other than with respect to amendments, waivers or other modifications that will
only affect the Fixed Rate Notes or the Floating Rate Notes. The Floating Rate Notes will bear
interest at a floating rate, will have a different call schedule and call protection and will have
other features that will differ from the Fixed Rate Notes. As a result of these differences, the
interests of holders of the Floating Rate Notes and the interests of holders of the Fixed Rate
Notes could conflict. In addition, the holders of one series of Notes may be in a position to
agree to certain terms in a consent solicitation that would be beneficial to such series of Notes
but adverse to the economic interest of the other series of Notes; however, to the extent the
relevant amendment or waiver is approved by the holders of a majority in aggregate principal
amount of the Notes then outstanding (subject to the limited exceptions described above), all
holders of the Notes will be bound by such amendment.

**_If Spanish tax authorities determine that income derived from the Notes or the Note_**
**_Guarantees should be treated as Spanish source income, tax at a 19% rate could apply. Such_**
**_tax might be collected by withholding or by payment by holders of the Notes. In certain_**
**_situations, we could be required to gross-up any such payments or reimburse holders for the_**
**_amount of any tax imposed and this could materially affect our financial position._**
Under the Spanish Non-Resident Income Tax Legislation, the Spanish tax authorities may
determine that, under certain circumstances, payments on the Notes or the Note Guarantees
should be treated as Spanish source income subject to tax currently at a 19% rate.

Under Spanish tax rules, it is arguable that holders of the Notes should not be subject to such
tax, and that all payments of principal and interest made with respect to the Notes or the Note
Guarantees should be made free and clear of any withholding or deduction of any taxes,
duties, assessments or governmental charges of any nature whatsoever which may be imposed,
levied, collected, withheld or assessed by the Kingdom of Spain or any political subdivision or
authority thereof or therein. However, there is no clear precedent to support this position.

If such tax were imposed by withholding any payments on the Notes or the Note Guarantees,
the Indenture will require us, in certain situations, to gross-up any such payments to cover the
full amount of the taxes required to be withheld. If you are obligated to make payments as a
result of such tax, we will be obligated under the Indenture to reimburse you for the full
amount of the taxes required to be paid. The amounts we would be required to gross-up or
reimburse could be substantial and could materially adversely affect our financial condition and
results of operations.

**_There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the_**
**_Notes may be limited._**
We cannot assure you as to the liquidity of any market in the Notes, your ability to sell your
Notes or the prices at which you would be able to sell your Notes. Future trading prices for the
Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things, prevailing interest rates,
our operating results and the market for similar securities. Historically, the market for
non-investment grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial
volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. The liquidity of a trading market for
the Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities
and is subject to disruptions that may cause volatility in prices. The trading market for the
Notes may attract different investors and this may affect the extent to which the Notes may
trade. It is possible that the market for the Notes will be subject to disruptions. Any such
disruption may have a negative effect on you, as a holder of the Notes, regardless of our
prospects and financial performance. As a result, there is no assurance that there will be an
active trading market for the Notes. If no active trading market develops, you may not be able
to resell your Notes at a fair value, if at all.

Although an application will be made for the Notes to be listed on the Official List of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on the Euro MTF market, we cannot

74


-----

assure you that the Notes will be, or that the Notes shall remain, listed. Although no assurance
is made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of the admission to trading on the Euro MTF
market, the failure to be approved for listing or the delisting (whether or not for an
alternative admission to listing on another stock exchange) of the Notes from the Official List
of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange may have a material effect on a holder’s ability to resell
the Notes, as applicable, in the secondary market.

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and_**
**_may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**
One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The
credit ratings address our ability to perform our obligations under the terms of the Notes and
credit risks in determining the likelihood that payments will be made when due under the
Notes. The ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure,
market and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes, including the additional risk
factors discussed above. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities
and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No
assurance can be given that a credit rating will remain constant for any given period of time or
that a credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency if, in
its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant.

A suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the Notes
by one or more of the credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost and terms and
conditions of our financings and could adversely affect the value and trading of the Notes.

**_The transfer of the Notes is restricted, which may adversely affect their liquidity and the price_**
**_at which they may be sold._**
The Notes and the Note Guarantees have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S.
Securities Act or the securities laws of any state or any other jurisdiction and, unless so
registered, may not be offered or sold in the United States, except pursuant to an exemption
from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act
and the applicable securities laws of any state or any other jurisdiction. We have not agreed to
or otherwise undertaken to register any of the Notes or the Note Guarantees, and do not have
any intention to do so. See ‘‘Notice to Investors.’’ It is the obligation of holders of the Notes to
ensure that their offers and sales of the Notes within the United States and other countries
comply with applicable securities laws.

**_You may be unable to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities laws violations._**
We are organized under the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. All our directors and
executive officers and the directors and executive officers of the Guarantors are non-residents
of the United States and all their assets are located outside the United States. As a result, it
may not be possible for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon us,
the Guarantors or our or their respective directors and executive officers, or to enforce any
judgments obtained in U.S. courts predicated upon civil liability provisions of the U.S. securities
laws. In addition, we cannot assure you that civil liabilities predicated upon the federal
securities laws of the United States will be enforceable in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg,
Spain or Portugal. See ‘‘Enforcement of Civil Liabilities.’’

**_The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form, and therefore you must rely on the_**
**_procedures of the relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**
Owners of the book-entry interests will not be considered owners or holders of the Notes
unless and until definitive notes are issued in exchange for book-entry interests. Instead, the
common depositary (or its nominee) for Euroclear and Clearstream will be the sole registered
holder of the Notes in global form.

75


-----

Payments of principal, interest and other amounts owing on or in respect of the Notes in
global form will be made to The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch as the Paying
Agent, which will make payments to Euroclear and Clearstream. Thereafter, such payments will
be credited to Euroclear and Clearstream participants’ accounts that hold book-entry interests
in the Notes in global form and credited by such participants to indirect participants. After
payment to Euroclear and Clearstream, none of the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Trustee, the
Security Agent, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent or any Paying Agent will have any
responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments of interest,
principal or other amounts to Euroclear and Clearstream, or to owners of book-entry interests.
Accordingly, if you own a book-entry interest in the relevant Notes, you must rely on the
procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and, if you are not a participant in Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, on the procedures of the participant through which you own your interest, to
exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of the Notes under the Indenture.

Owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right to act upon our solicitations for
consents or requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes, including
enforcement of security for the Notes. Instead, if you own a book-entry interest, you must rely
on the common depositary (as registered holder of the Notes) to act on your instructions and
will be permitted to act directly only to the extent you have received appropriate proxies to do
so from Euroclear and Clearstream or, if applicable, from a participant. We cannot assure you
that procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies will be sufficient to enable you
to vote on any requested actions or to take any other action on a timely basis.

**_You may face currency exchange risks or adverse tax consequences by investing in the Notes_**
**_denominated in currencies other than your reference currency._**
The Notes will be denominated and payable in Euros. If you are a non-Euro investor, an
investment in the Notes will entail foreign exchange related risks due to, among other factors,
possible significant changes in the value of the Euro relative to other relevant currencies
because of economic, political or other factors over which we have no control. Depreciation of
the Euro against other relevant currencies could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the
Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to you when the return on the
Notes is translated into the currency by reference to which you measure the return on your
investments. Investments in the Notes by U.S. investors may also have important tax
consequences as a result of foreign currency exchange gains or losses, if any. See ‘‘Tax
_Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations.’’_

# Use of Proceeds

We estimate that the gross proceeds from the Offering will be e575.0 million. The gross
proceeds from the Offering along with cash on the balance sheet will be used (i) to fund the
Redemption, (ii) to pay a distribution to the shareholders of the Parent Guarantor through a
partial repayment of the Subordinated Shareholder Loan and (iii) to pay the fees, commissions
and expenses incurred in connection with the Offering and the Redemption.

The expected estimated sources and uses of the funds necessary to consummate the
transactions described above are shown in the table below as if they had occurred as at
September 30, 2019. Actual amounts may vary from estimated amounts depending on several
factors, including differences from our estimate of existing cash in the business, our estimates
of the cost of repaying the existing indebtedness described below, differences from our
estimates of fees, expenses and commissions and the ultimate timing of the Redemption Date.
For descriptions of our current and anticipated indebtedness following the Offering and the
use of proceeds therefrom, see ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements.’’ See also
‘‘Capitalization.’’

Consolidated Financial Statements and (iii) as of and for the nine months ended September 30,
2018 and 2019, from the Interim Group Consolidated Financial Statements, as included
elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

The unaudited financial information for the twelve months ended September 30, 2019,
presented herein, is derived by adding our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial
information for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 extracted from the Interim Group
Consolidated Financial Statements and our audited consolidated financial information for the
year ended December 31, 2018 extracted from the 2018 Group Consolidated Financial
Statements and subtracting our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial
information for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 extracted from the Interim Group
Consolidated Financial Statements.

The 2017 Special Purpose Empark Group Consolidated Financial Position, Income and Cashflow
Statements are special purpose financial statements of the Empark Group which have been
prepared solely for inclusion in this offering memorandum. They do not include information on
the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the notes thereto and other disclosures as
they solely disclose the relevant and necessary notes for an appropriate understanding of the
consolidated special purpose financial position, income and cash flow statements of the Empark
Group as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Effective January 1, 2019 the Group has adopted IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective
method of adoption with the date of initial application (1 January 2019). Under this method,
the reclassifications and the adjustments arising from the new lease accounting rules are
directly recognized in the opening balance on January 1, 2019.

The results of operations for the interim periods or prior years are not necessarily indicative of
the results to be expected for the full year or any future period or our financial condition at
any future date. The following selected historical consolidated financial information should be
read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, the consolidated
financial statements of the Group and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this
offering memorandum, and should also be read together with the information set forth under

## Overview

We are one of the leading concessionaires and operators of parking infrastructure in the
Iberian Peninsula, as measured by number of parking spaces and revenues. We mainly operate
underground car parks (‘‘off-street’’), as well as some parking areas on city streets (‘‘on-street’’)
under concessions and surface rights agreements from public authorities. As of September 30,
2019, our portfolio comprised 403 concession contracts in 145 municipalities under which we
manage over 436,920 parking spaces, including 33,366 resident spaces, primarily in Spain and
Portugal, and marginally in Andorra, Turkey and the UK. For the twelve months ended
September 30, 2019, our revenues were e197.3 million, our Adjusted Revenue was
e196.4 million, our Adjusted EBITDA was e90.6 million and we had an Adjusted EBITDA Margin
of 46.1%. Our operations in Spain and Portugal, respectively, represented 70.7% and 25.4% of
our Adjusted Revenue, 68.2% and 28.9% of our gross profits and 82.9% and 13.9% of our
parking spaces for the twelve months ended September 30, 2019. Our off-street concession
business and on-street concession business generated 56.5% and 35.5% of our Adjusted
Revenue, respectively, and 83.9% and 16.5% of our Adjusted EBITDA, respectively, for the
twelve months ended September 30, 2019.

We have served the Iberian market since the late 1960s. We believe this has given us a ‘‘first
mover’’ advantage, whereby we have continually secured long-term concessions and built a
portfolio of prime parking locations in Spain and Portugal, including in city centers, airports
and other high density traffic areas, such as hospitals and business districts. Due to a variety of
physical, regulatory and other constraints such as cost of space, we believe that there is limited
opportunity to develop alternative parking options in many of these prime areas, allowing us
to benefit from captive demand with limited competition. Due to an overall lack of available
land in major cities within our geographical focus, and an overall urbanization trend in the

83


-----

current macroeconomic climate, we do not expect this competitive advantage to diminish in
the foreseeable future.

We generate revenues under three business lines:

- Off-street concessions. Our off-street concession business primarily comprises long-term
concessions, with contract lengths generally ranging from 20 to 50 years, granted by
municipalities to develop and operate parking facilities, primarily underground and multistory, and generated 56.5% of our Adjusted Revenue (e111.0 million) and 83.9% of our
Adjusted EBITDA (e76.0 million), and had an Adjusted EBITDA Margin of 68.5%, for the
twelve months ended September 30, 2019. Under these contracts, we are generally required
to invest in the construction of a new parking facility (a ‘‘green field’’ concession) or make an
upfront payment to the municipality for an existing parking facility (a ‘‘brown field’’
concession). We operate each parking facility on a long-term basis and generate our fees
based on tariffs charged to car park users, as set out in the relevant concession or surface
rights agreement, which typically increase each year in line with inflation. We generally
retain all fees generated from operating the relevant parking facility and are responsible for
all expenses relating to operating and maintaining the parking facility during the term of
the concession. With respect to ‘‘brown field’’ concessions, we may pay an annual concession
fee to the municipality, an upfront fee or a combination of both. In addition, we sell a
limited number of parking spaces to local residents, receiving a monthly fee for the
rendering of maintenance services, as an ancillary activity in connection with the
development of some parking facilities. As of September 30, 2019, we had 285 off-street
concession contracts (including 78 resident contracts) under which we manage approximately
120,003 parking spaces. The Weighted Average Remaining Duration of our off-street
concessions was approximately 25 years as of September 30, 2019.

- On-street concessions. Our on-street concession business comprises concessions, with contract
lengths generally ranging from five to 20 years, granted by municipalities to manage metercontrolled on-street parking, and generated 35.5% of our Adjusted Revenue (e69.7 million)
and 16.5% of our Adjusted EBITDA (e15.0 million), and had an Adjusted EBITDA Margin of
21.5%, during the twelve months ended September 30, 2019. For these types of contracts,
we typically receive fixed fees that are inflation-indexed and which cover the yearly
amortized amount of our initial investment and operating costs and reasonable rate of
return. In a number of concessions, the contract also includes a variable incentive element
(which may be based on a percentage of the collected meter receipts, the number of parking
spaces or certain other indicators) to align the concessionaire’s objectives with optimizing
revenue collection. As of September 30, 2019, we had 114 on-street concession contracts
(including seven contracts exclusively dedicated to tow-away services) under which we
manage approximately 230,966 parking spaces. We have a long-standing presence in many
cities and a successful relationship with many municipalities which we believe provides us
with a competitive advantage in securing new off-street business. The Weighted Average
Remaining Duration of our on-street concessions was approximately five years as of
September 30, 2019.

- Off-street contract management. Our off-street contract management business involves
contracts to manage parking facilities on behalf of public authorities, primarily airports, as
well as a limited number of private entities. Our off-street contract management business
generated 8.0% of our Adjusted Revenue (e15.7 million) and did not affect our Adjusted
EBITDA in a meaningful way in the twelve months ended September 30, 2019. As of
September 30, 2019, we had four off-street management contracts. Under these contracts,
we operate and manage parking facilities with approximately 85,951 parking spaces on
behalf of third parties in exchange for a fixed fee. Although it is a relatively small part of
our overall business, our off-street contract management business line allows us to gain
expertise in managing complex operations, as well as to improve our access to municipalities
and build local market knowledge.

## Factors affecting results of operations

**_Business lines_**
Our Adjusted EBITDA Margins vary between our off-street concession, on-street concession and
off-street contract management business lines.

_Off-street:_ In general, our long-term off-street concessions have the highest Adjusted EBITDA
Margins among our different types of concessions, but also involve the largest up-front
investments. There is significant variation in Adjusted EBITDA Margins among our off-street
concessions, with some concessions generating significantly greater Adjusted EBITDA and
Adjusted EBITDA Margins than others. Our on-street concession and off-street contract
management businesses tend to have lower Adjusted EBITDA Margins than our off-street
concession business, but also require minimal investment and face lower demand risk because a
smaller proportion of our revenue depends on volumes or occupancy. For our off-street
concessions, as well as many of our on-street concessions and other contracts, our revenue
comes primarily from the payments we receive from users to use the parking spaces on a ‘‘pay
as you go’’ (hourly) or subscription (monthly or yearly) basis.

We also generate revenue from the sale of parking spaces, primarily to local residents.

_On-street:_ In our on-street concessions, we generate revenue under a number of different
pricing models. The most common model is for us to receive a fixed fee which we withhold
from the funds collected from the metered parking spaces and transfer the remaining funds to
the grantor. In a number of concessions, the contract also includes a variable incentive element
(which may be based on a percentage of the collected meter receipts, the number of parking
spaces or certain other qualitative criteria) to align the concessionaire’s objectives with
optimizing revenue collection. Under some of our on-street concessions, we receive the entire
amount of tariffs collected from users.

_Off-street contract management:_ For our contracts in the off-street contract management
business, our revenue primarily consists of the fixed fees we receive from the owner of the
facility for managing the parking facilities.

**_Concession cycle_**
Our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA are affected by how much time has passed since our new
off-street concessions became operational. The revenue and Adjusted EBITDA of new car parks
gradually increase in the first three to four years (the ‘‘ramp up’’ phase) after they become
operational, and then remain fairly stable with, in most cases, moderate increases due to
inflation adjustments and volume increases (largely reflecting increased demand due to traffic
increases in cities) for the remaining duration of the concession. Parking spaces sold to local
residents are recorded as revenues at the time of sale and, as a result, off-street concessions
can generate significant revenues and Adjusted EBITDA in the first year they become
operational. Therefore, 0.20%, 0.18% and 0.10% of our revenues was attributable to the sale
of parking spaces to local residents, as required by the terms of the relevant concession in the
years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively. See ‘‘—Liquidity and Capital
_Resources—Cash flows from investment activities’’ below. However, we do not expect that sales_
of parking spaces will remain a significant factor affecting our results of operations in future
periods.

**_Demand risk_**
The revenues from our off-street concessions are influenced by demand and volumes, which
primarily depend on the location of the particular concession. On-street concessions and
off-street contract management arrangements have less demand risk because the bulk of the
revenues from such arrangements are usually based on a fixed fee. Our concessions are also
affected by changes in the traffic flow in cities, which in turn directly impacts demand. Traffic
flow in urban areas can be affected by a number of factors, including changes in economic

activity in an area, local traffic regulations and gasoline prices. Parking can also be affected by
general economic conditions, but we believe to a lesser degree than in other infrastructure
businesses because end users view many trips during which they use our parking facilities as
non-discretionary. In addition, we have implemented various measures to increase our revenues
and improve EBITDA as further described under ‘‘Summary—Strategy—Maintain focus on
_growing revenue and improving EBITDA and Cash Flows.’’_

**_Obtaining new concessions and contracts_**
Off-street concessions, which represented 83.9% of our Adjusted EBITDA in the twelve months
ended September 30, 2019, offer stable cash flows given the long-term nature of these
contracts (which can be up to 50 years if they include the obligation to carry out construction
works). The Weighted Average Remaining Duration of our off-street concessions and contracts
was approximately 25 years as of September 30, 2019. Cash flows with respect to our on-street
concession business are potentially less stable because such concessions come up for renewal
more frequently (approximately every five years). Increasing our revenues is dependent in part
on obtaining new concessions and winning concessions from our competitors when they are up
for renewal, while maintaining our existing concessions. Between January 1, 2016 and
September 30, 2019, we have achieved a Replacement Rate of approximately 73% with respect
to on-street contracts and concessions for which we submitted bids when they came up for
tender.

Recently, municipalities have increased the duration for certain on-street concessions put up to
tender in exchange for higher initial fee payments payable by the concessionaire. For example,
we have an on-street concession with a term of 15 years in Huesca and another with a term of
12 years in Porto, which commenced in 2016. We believe this trend of increasing the duration
of on-street concessions in exchange for higher upfront payments by the concessionaire
benefits us given our size, scale and well established position within the market. In addition,
from time to time we may make acquisitions which meet our stringent financial requirements,
which will in turn expand our portfolio of concessions.

**_Yield management and intensification to drive revenue growth_**
We seek to increase our revenue through obtaining new concessions and winning concessions
from our competitors when they are up for renewal. We also seek to increase our revenue in
our off-street concession business by increasing volumes and occupancy through a well-defined
pricing policy, including with respect to our season ticket offering, tariff structure and special
offers and promotions as well as obtaining additional ancillary revenues through client
segmentation, product mix or launch of new products through digital channels. In our
on-street concession business, we seek to grow our revenue by improving our on-street
revenue collection through the implementation of best practices, so as to improve our variable
incentive compensation payments under the relevant concession.

**_Cost control initiatives and EBITDA improvements_**
Additionally, we anticipate that revenues from our large parking facilities opened in the past
three years will increase over the coming years as they are currently in the ‘‘ramp up’’ phase.
Since a substantial portion of our revenue is largely stable and predictable as a result of being
generated under existing long-term concessions and contracts, one of the drivers of EBITDA is
our ability to control costs. The nature of our costs varies between our business lines. In our
off-street concession business, we are generally required to make a significant capital
expenditure upfront in connection with our investment in a new parking facility or an upfront
payment to the municipality for an existing facility. Once that initial expense has been
incurred, our off-street costs are largely stable and primarily relate to personnel costs,
maintenance costs (mainly cleaning), local taxes and utilities. In our on-street concession
business, our upfront costs are considerably lower and may consist of a lump-sum payment to
the municipality or relate to the acquisition and installation of on-street parking control

equipment, such as parking meters. After that initial investment has been made, most of our
on-street costs consist of personnel costs. In our contract management business, our costs
consist primarily off-street contract management business, our costs consist primarily of
personnel costs, with maintenance accounting for only a small portion of costs.

We have implemented a number of measures by which we have successfully reduced costs,
including the introduction of technological innovations to help increase productivity and the
number of parking spaces covered per employee. For example, our centralized control room
system controls and manages a substantial majority of our off-street concessions business’
parking facilities from a remote location, which has allowed us to improve our cash flow and
reduce operating expenses by up to 45% compared to industry standards, as well as reducing
headcount and personnel costs (we reduced the number of operators per car park by more
than half) without impacting our service quality and customer satisfaction levels. This is a key
driver for efficiency gains and margin improvements, particularly in the off-street segment,
allowing for more competitive pricing when bidding for new contracts and placing us in a
strong position for additional growth. In addition, such measures have helped us to reduce our
reliance on external service providers by enabling us to reallocate personnel to perform certain
functions previously performed by third party service providers. Furthermore, we have
introduced energy saving measures to drive energy efficiency improvements, such as
implementing automatic devices to regulate lighting in our car parks, as well as carrying out
active monitoring and management of energy prices through negotiation with utility providers.
We continue to seek opportunities to further reduce costs and improve EBITDA.

## Key Line Items

**_Revenues_**
Revenues consists primarily of the parking fees and other revenue we receive from customers
for use of parking spaces and fees from municipalities and other entities for managing parking
spaces and facilities. The fees we charge users and the fees we receive for managing parking
spaces and facilities are typically indexed to inflation. Revenues also includes revenue from the
sale of parking spaces to local residents as an ancillary activity in connection with the
development of some parking facilities. For the sale of parking spaces, we recognize revenues
at the time the parking space is sold, which coincides with the time at which the relevant
contract is signed. In our on-street concession business, in which we may be paid a fixed fee by
the municipality, we recognize revenue with respect to such fixed fees when the service is
provided to the municipality. Revenues are recognized when the value can reliably be
determined and all contingencies have been resolved, and it is probable that we will receive
the future economic benefits. In our off-street concession business, revenues are recorded
either when the hourly rate is paid or on an accrual basis for season ticket holders. For those
concessions in respect of which we are paid a fee linked to the amount of collected meter
receipts, we recognize revenue with respect to such fee at the time of such collection.

**_Other operating income_**
Other operating income consists of revenue from certain basic amenities provided to car park
users within our parking facilities (for example, revenue from vending machines and car
washes) and other services and products provided or sold to car park users, as well as other
non-recurrent revenue which is ‘‘one off’’ in nature.

**_Adjusted revenue_**
We define Adjusted Revenue as revenues plus other operating income less other non-recurring
revenue less other ‘‘one off’’ items or non-recurring gains and losses (including gains and losses
realized from the sale of parking spaces to local residents and gains and losses realized on the
sale of parking facilities). Adjusted Revenue is a non-IFRS measure that we use to evaluate our
operating and financial performance and should not be considered as an alternative measure
to accounting measures under IFRS. See ‘‘Presentation of Financial and Other Information.’’

87


-----

**_Changes in inventory_**
Changes in inventory represents the costs of the parking spaces that are sold. We determine
these costs by allocating the construction costs associated with such spaces. Such expense is
recognized at the time the corresponding revenue for the sale is recognized. See
‘‘—Amortization and depreciation’’ below.

**_Cost of sales_**
Cost of sales consist of the cost of goods and materials bought that are necessary to provide
customers with the relevant services, including tickets for our automated ticket machines and
other materials.

**_Payroll_**
Payroll include employee wages, salaries and similar costs, social security, pensions and similar
costs and other non-recurrent personnel costs. The majority of our staff costs are incurred with
respect to our on-street concession business and, to a lesser extent, our off-street contract
management business.

**_Other operating expenses_**
Other operating expenses primarily consist of costs for external services including information
technology and other outsourced services such as security and shuttle buses at airports. This
expense category also includes overhead costs, local taxes, concession fees and non-recurring
operating expenses.

**_Amortization and depreciation_**
Under IFRIC 12 and IAS 16, we record the capital cost of developing and constructing parking
structures and installing parking meters under concession contracts as intangible assets on our
balance sheet. Amortization expenses primarily include the amortization of these capital costs
over the term of the concession agreement on a straight line basis. It also includes
amortization on equipment and other tangible assets accounted for using the straight line
method over the estimated useful life of the asset. To the extent an agreement is terminated
early, we write off any remaining cost of capital on our balance sheet.

**_Provisions and losses of unrecoverable credits_**
Provisions and losses of unrecoverable credits consists of expenses that we reserve for in the
relevant estimated amount to take account of the potential insolvency of our customers. In
general, we do not make provision for municipalities or other public bodies with which we do
business. For private bodies, we make provision within 90 to 360 days after the due date for
collection and do so on a case by case basis with the relevant contract manager.

**_Impairment and result through disposal of fixed assets_**
Impairment and result through disposal of fixed assets primarily consists of gains or losses on
the sale of concessions or parking facilities. It also includes any asset impairment charges made
at the end of each year to reduce the holding value of assets to recoverable value, if lower.
The recoverable value is the lower of the market value and the value in use of the asset.

**_Financial result_**
Financial result comprises financial profit or loss primarily attributable to interest expense on
our debt and any interest income we receive, usually from cash held at banks. It also includes
hedging profits or loss from our hedging instruments. During the period under review, our
hedging comprised interest rate swaps on our variable rate debt.

88


-----

**_Share of profit/(loss) from associates_**
Share of profit/(loss) from associates consists of our proportionate share of the income from
companies in which we hold minority interests. We generally hold minority interests in
companies when necessary to obtain concessions where the municipalities have required that
the controlling interest be held by the municipality.

**_Corporate income tax_**
We recognize corporate income tax on our income statement both for amounts payable in the
current year and any applicable deferred tax attributable to the current year. In past years, we
have accumulated significant tax credits from our large capital expenditure program, which we
expect to reduce our taxes payable on a cash basis in future years.

**_Results attributed to minority interests_**
Results attributed to minority interests consist of the proportionate share of the income
attributable to third parties holding a minority interest in the relevant Group company.

**_EBITDA_**
We define EBITDA as Operating result excluding amortization and depreciation and provisions
and losses of unrecoverable credits. EBITDA is a non-IFRS measure that we use to evaluate our
operating and financial performance and should not be considered as an alternative measure
to accounting measures under IFRS. See ‘‘Presentation of Financial and Other Information.’’

**_Adjusted EBITDA_**
We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted for (i) non-recurring headquarter operating
expenses (including redundancy payments and other related personnel costs), (ii) non-recurring
business unit expenses and (iii) other ‘‘one off’’ items or non-recurring gains and losses
(including gains and losses realized from the sale and acquisition of parking spaces to local
residents and gains and losses realized on the sale of parking facilities), and includes the
EBITDA impact of the application of IFRS 16 starting from January 1, 2019. Adjusted EBITDA is
a non-IFRS measure that we use to evaluate our operating and financial performance and
should not be considered as an alternative measure to accounting measures under IFRS. See
‘‘Presentation of Financial and Other Information.’’

**_Adjusted EBITDA by business line_**

We define Adjusted EBITDA by business line as the EBITDA for the relevant business line
_adjusted for (i) reallocation of overhead costs and non-recurring headquarter operating_
expenses, (ii) non-recurring business unit expenses (including redundancy payments and other
related personnel costs) and (iii) other ‘‘one off’’ items or non- recurring gains and losses
(including gains and losses realized from the sale and acquisition of parking spaces to local
residents and gains and losses realized on the sale of parking facilities), and includes the
EBITDA impact of the application of IFRS 16 starting from January 1, 2019.

**_Revenues_**
Our revenues decreased by 7.2% from e159.1 million in the nine months ended September 30,
2018 to e147.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2019, mainly due to the
impacts on Adjusted Revenue in our business lines which is discussed below.

91


-----

**_Adjusted revenue_**
Adjusted Revenue decreased by 7.6% from e158.9 million in the nine months ended
September 30, 2018 to e146.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2019, primarily
as a result of the decrease in Adjusted Revenue in our on-street concession and off-street
contract management businesses as discussed below.

Adjusted Revenue from our off-street concession business increased by 3.4% from e80.8 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 to e83.5 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2019, due to the underlying like-for-like growth of existing concessions of 3.5%
as well as the revenue contribution form the new acquisitions performed during 2018 such as
El Arenal (Gij ´on) or Mendibil (Ir ´un).

On a like-for-like basis, Adjusted Revenue for our on-street concession business grew 3.6% due
to the outperformance of the Porto and Madrid contracts. However, as a result of the recent
disposal of our French business, the loss of certain contracts, such as the Toledo on-street
concession, and the end of the towing service in Palma de Mallorca, Adjusted Revenue from
our on-street concession business decreased by 6.0% from e55.2 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2018 to e51.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019.

Adjusted Revenue from our off-street contract management business decreased by 49.8% from
e22.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 to e11.5 million in the nine
months ended September 30, 2019, mainly due to the disposal of our UK business (other than
our contract at Edinburgh Airport, which was retained but is expected to be terminated on
January 31, 2020), on September 5, 2018.

**_Changes in inventory_**
Changes in inventory increased from a cost of e0.1 million in the nine months ended
September 30, 2018 to a cost of e1.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2019,
mainly due to the sale of resident spaces in Maristas car park (Sevilla) for an amount of
e0.8 million.

**_Cost of sales_**
Costs of sales decreased by 20.0% from a e0.5 million cost in the nine months ended
September 30, 2018 to a e0.4 million cost in the nine months ended September 30, 2019,
primarily as a result of an increase in tickets and paper reels for parking meters.

**_Other operating income_**
Other operating income remained stable at e0.3 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2018 and the nine months ended September 30, 2019.

**_Payroll_**
Our payroll decreased by 20.8% from a cost of e63.1 million during the nine months ended
September 30, 2018 to a cost of e50.0 million during the nine months ended September 30,
2019, primarily as a result of the disposal of our UK and French businesses, the efficiency gains
from our centralized control room system, and the impact of the corporate restructuring
implemented at the end of the year ended December 31, 2017.

**_Other operating expenses_**
Other operating expenses decreased by 16.1% from a e37.6 million expense for the nine
months ended September 30, 2018 to a e31.5 million expense for the nine months ended
September 30, 2019, primarily as a result of the disposal of our UK and French businesses, the
efficiency gains from our centralized control room system and the corporate restructuring
implemented at the end of the year ended December 31, 2017.

savings in terms of operating expenses and overheads, which have materialized in EBITDA
improvements across all business lines. Also, the application of IFRS 16 has generated a positive

Our Adjusted Revenue increased by 1.0% from e206.4 million in the year ended December 31,
2017 to e208.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2018.

Adjusted Revenue from our off-street concession business increased by 2.3% (4.9% on a
like-for-like basis) from e105.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 to e108.3 million
in the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily as a result of a significant revenue
enhancement from favorable traffic trends within the Iberian region, especially in Lisbon,
Catalonia, Andaluc´ıa and Comunidad Valenciana which was partly offset by the termination of
certain contracts such as Plaza Mayor or Plaza Espa ˜na in Madrid, which were insourced by the
municipality or Pra¸ca dos Poveiros in Porto.

Adjusted Revenue from our on-street concession businesses increased by 4.6% from
e69.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 to e73.0 million in the year ended
December 31, 2018, primarily as a result of an over-performance of certain contracts such as
those in Madrid, Vila Nova de Gaia and Porto, and the securing of two new contracts in the
fourth quarter of the year ended December 31, 2017, those in Santander (6,677 spaces) and
Zamora (1,162 spaces). Like-for-like growth in the on-street concession business was 3.5%
during the year ended December 31, 2018.

Adjusted Revenue from our off-street contract management business decreased by 11.7% from
e30.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 to e27.1 million in the year ended
December 31, 2018, primarily due to the disposal of our UK business (other than our contract
at Edinburgh Airport, which was retained but is expected to be terminated on January 31,
2020) on September 5, 2018.

**_Changes in inventory_**
Changes in inventory increased from a cost of e0.4 million in the year ended December 31,
2017 to a cost of e2.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 due to impairment of
resident spaces of Mazarredo, Passeig Noudisposal of car park spaces to residents and Plaza la

-----

Vila car parks for amount e1.5 million and the impairment of parking meters of on-street
contracts for an amount of e0.4 million.

**_Cost of sales_**
The cost of sales increased by 33.3% from a cost of e0.6 million in the year ended
December 31, 2017 to a cost of e0.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 due to the
derecognition of parking meters of the finished on-street contracts.

**_Other operating income_**
Other operating income increased by 44.4% from e0.9 million in the year ended December 31,
2017 to e1.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 due to non-recurring revenues.

**_Payroll_**
Our payroll decreased by 0.7% from e82.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 to
e82.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 due to the disposal of the UK business on
September 5, 2018, as well as the implementation of efficiency measures in the newly acquired
car parks.

**_Other operating expenses_**
Other operating expenses decreased by 19.1% from e56.0 million in the year ended
December 31, 2017 to e45.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. This was primarily
due to the disposal of our UK business (other than our contract at Edinburgh Airport, which
was retained but is expected to be terminated on January 31, 2020), the efficiency gains from
our centralized control room system and the synergies and cost savings gained from the
corporate restructuring implemented at the end of the year ended December 31, 2017.

The following table shows the components of other operating expenses for the relevant
periods.

e28.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 to an amortization amount equal to
e69.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily as a result of the amortization of
the adjustments made derived from the purchase price allocation which during 2018 captured
full year effect for the first time.

**_Provisions and losses of unrecoverable credits_**
Provisions and losses of unrecoverable credits decreased marginally from a loss of e1.0 million
in the year ended December 31, 2017 to a loss of e0.9 million in the year ended December 31,
2018.

-----

**_Impairment and result through disposal of fixed assets_**
Impairment and result through disposal of fixed assets was a loss of e11.1 million for the year
ended December 31, 2018, compared to nil for the year ended December 31, 2017, mainly due
to the deterioration in value of certain contracts, particularly as derived from the purchase
price allocation under certain acquisition contracts such as for Mercado del Carmen.

**_Financial result_**
Losses through financial result decreased by 2.1% from a loss of e43.3 million in the year
ended December 31, 2017 to a loss of e42.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, as a
result of the new capital structure put in place at the time of the Empark Acquisition.

## Share of profit/(loss) from associates

Share of profit/(loss) from associates increased by 20.0% from e1.5 million in the year ended
December 31, 2017 to e1.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily as a result
of the improved performance of the equity affiliates.

**_Corporate income tax_**
Corporate income tax increased from a cost of e0.2 million in the year ended December 31,
2017 to a gain of e9.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, driven by a greater tax
shield generated as a consequence of the amortization of the purchase price allocation for the
Empark Acquisition.

## Profit/(loss) attributable to non-controlling interests

Profit/(loss) attributable to non-controlling interests deteriorated slightly from a loss of
e0.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 to a loss of e0.4 million in the year ended
December 31, 2018.

e79.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. Adjusted EBITDA increased by 16.8% for
the year ended December 31, 2018 to e85.0 million, as compared to e72.7 million in the year
ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to the performance of the business in certain Iberian
regions, such as Lisbon, Catalonia, Andaluc´ıa and Comunidad Valenciana, the ramp-up effect of
newly acquired concessions and the application of IFRIC 12 on private concession contracts.

**_Revenues_**
Our revenues increased by 2.7% from e201.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 to
e206.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, following strong performance in a
favorable economic environment and the obtaining of new concessions, such as those in Le ´on
and Badajoz.

**_Adjusted Revenue_**
Our Adjusted Revenue increased by 2.6% from e201.1 million in the year ended December 31,
2016 to e206.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of the gains
made in our on-street concession business, as discussed below.

Adjusted Revenue from our off-street concession business increased by 7.1% (6.4% on a
like-for-like basis) from e98.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 to e105.8 million in
the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of a favorable macroeconomic
environment contributing positively to an increase in city traffic, resulting in more cash
generated by off-street assets. This was off-set by the reversion of the Plaza de Espa ˜na and Les
Tereses concessions to their respective municipalities, reducing the number of car parking
spaces by 1,167, with other contracts such as Santa Isabel, Doce de Octubre and Juan Ramon
Jimenez Hospital expiring.

Adjusted Revenue from our on-street concession business increased by 2.5% from e68.1 million
in the year ended December 31, 2016 to e69.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2017,
although Adjusted EBITDA decreased from e10.9 million to e10.4 million for the same periods,
respectively. This reduction in Adjusted EBITDA despite an increase in Adjusted Revenue was
the result of costs associated with the settlement of various contracts such as those in Huelva
and Alcobendas, and the renewal and extensions of various contracts (the most relevant being
Valladolid with a ten-year tenor and two possible one-year extensions).

Adjusted Revenue from our off-street contract management business decreased by 10.2% from
e34.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 to e30.7 million in the year ended
December 31, 2017 due to the termination of the Stansted contract.

**_Changes in inventory_**
Losses attributable to change in inventories decreased by 41.7% from a loss of e0.7 million in
the year ended December 31, 2016 to a loss of e0.4 million in the year ended December 31,
2017, mainly due to the sale of resident spaces in Oquendo car park (San Sebasti´an) and Los
Maristas in an aggregate amount of amount e0.2 million.

**_Cost of sales_**
The cost of sales remained stable at e0.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and
December 31, 2017.

**_Other operating income_**
Other operating income increased by 14.1% from e0.7 million in the year ended December 31,
2016 to e0.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to an indemnity
received with respect to our Poeta Marquina car park.

**_Payroll_**
Our payroll increased from e82.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 to e82.7 million
in the year ended December 31, 2017.

**_Other operating expenses_**
Other operating expenses increased by 15.6% from e48.5 million in the year ended
December 31, 2016 to e56.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result
of the costs associated with contract settlements, renewals and extensions, as discussed above.

The following table shows the components of other operating expenses for the relevant
periods.

e26.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2016, to an amortization amount equal to
e28.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2017.

**_Provisions and losses of unrecoverable credits_**
Provisions and losses of unrecoverable credits decreased from a negligible gain in the year
ended December 31, 2016, to a loss of e1.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 due
to a positive impact recorded during 2016 for an excess provision for replacement under IFRIC
for Empark Infraestructuras S.A.U. (formerly Estacionamientos Infraestructuras, S.A.U.).

**_Financial result_**
Losses attributable to financial result increased by 31.4% from a loss of e33.0 million in the
year ended December 31, 2016 to a loss of e43.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2017,
primarily due to refinancing costs incurred in relation to the incurrence of new third party debt
by way of the offering of the Existing Notes and replacement of the existing credit line.

Share of profit/(loss) from associates Share of profit/(loss) from associates increased by 23.8%
from e1.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 to e1.5 million in the year ended
December 31, 2017.

**_Corporate income tax_**
We had corporate income tax of e1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared
to e0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This change was primarily driven by the
transaction cost incurred in connection with the Empark Acquisition and the issuance of the
Existing Notes.

**_EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA_**
Our EBITDA decreased by 2.6% from e69.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 to
e68.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of significantly
increased advisory fees incurred in connection with the Empark Acquisition and the redemption
cost of the notes refinanced at that time. Adjusted EBITDA increased by 1.7% from
e71.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 to e72.7 million in the year ended
December 31, 2017.

## Liquidity and Capital Resources

We had cash and cash equivalents of e37.8 million as of September 30, 2019. As of
September 30, 2019, after giving pro forma effect to the issuance of the Notes and the
Redemption, our cash and cash equivalents would have been e15.0 million.

The following table shows our statement of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2016,
2017 and 2018, for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2019, and for the twelve

**_Cash flows from operating activities_**
Our on-street concession business generally requires greater working capital, due to the
dynamics associated with the payment of receivables from municipalities under the relevant
concessions. Our off-street concession business generally has negative working capital, due to
the immediate collection of tariffs from car park users (if they do not pay then they cannot
exit the car park) and the receipt of payment for season tickets in advance. Generally, our
working capital is fairly stable with minimal effects from seasonality. We seek to maintain a
business model that enjoys negative working capital primarily as a result of the direct
payments we receive from end users of our off-street parking facilities.

operating activities for each of the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, the nine

For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, our cash flows from operating activities
consisted of a cash inflow of e35.1 million. The e24.4 million increase on the same period for
2018 was derived primarily from improved working capital and no registered transaction costs.
Changes in working capital resulted in a e4.0 million inflow for the nine months ended
September 30, 2019, largely due to a decrease in transaction costs and a decrease in debtors
and other accounts receivable.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2018, our cash flows from operating activities
consisted of a cash inflow of e10.7 million, driven primarily by a general strong performance
throughout and the securing of new contracts. Working capital resulted in a e19.4 million
outflow for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, driven primarily by high transaction

costs comprising e15.0 million one-off advisory, refinancing and transaction payments incurred
in connection with the Empark Acquisition, which were accrued during the year ended
December 31, 2017.

For the year ended December 31, 2018, our cash flows from operating activities consisted of a
cash inflow of e21.2 million, driven primarily by a general strong performance throughout the
business.

For the year ended December 31, 2017, our cash flows from operating activities consisted of a
cash inflow of e23.5 million, driven primarily by the underlying performance of the business
which grew at 1.8% in terms of Adjusted EBITDA despite the termination of certain contracts,
working capital inflows in a business model that generally sustains negative working capital in
the off-street concessions segment, our largest business line and the tax payment of
e18.5 million. Working capital for the year resulted in a e5.3 million inflow.

For the year ended December 31, 2016, our cash flows from operating activities consisted of a
cash inflow of e64.2 million. Working capital resulted in a e4.6 million outflow for the year
ended December 31, 2016, driven primarily by the accounting treatment of an on-street
contract in Madrid under IAS 18 (e2.8 million) and the deterioration of client accounts
(e3.8 million).

## Cash Flows from Investment Activities

We invested an aggregate of e132.7 million between January 1, 2016 and September 30, 2019.
Specifically, we invested e37.8 million, e27.7 million and e25.4 million in the years ended
December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively, and e39.2 million in the nine months ended
September 30, 2019. As of September 30, 2019, we had e24.1 million in outstanding capital
commitments for constructing new car parks relating to concessions already awarded in Lisbon,
which we expect to invest approximately between 2020 and 2025.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, our investment activities consisted of a cash
outflow of e39.1 million, consisting of an invested amount of e39.9 million and consideration
of e0.7 million received from the disposal of our French business on January 10, 2019 (after
accounting for e0.2 million attributable to the change in perimeter). Investments were
primarily attributable to the acquisition of the following assets:

- Boulevard car park in San Sebasti´an with an average remaining life of approximately
27 years) as of September 30, 2019;

- Can Quiteria car park in Sant Cugat del Vall´es (Barcelona) with an average remaining life of
approximately 35 years as of September 30, 2019;

- the acquisition of the 70% stake not owned in Figueira Parques with an average remaining
life of seven years as of September 30, 2019; and

- the commencement of the construction of Arco do Cego car park in Lisbon, which has an
average remaining life of 85 years since the start of the operation of the concession.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2018, our cash flows from investment activities
consisted of a cash outflow of e12.5 million, mainly related to the acquisition of the following
assets:

- Plaza de Espa ˜na concession in Fuengirola with an average remaining life of approximately
41 years as of September 30, 2019;

- the acquisition of Parking Sala in Barcelona, a freehold car park with an average remaining
life of approximately 81 years as of September 30, 2019;

- the acquisition of CNN—S˜ao Bento in Lisbon with an average remaining life of approximately
17 years as of September 30, 2019; and

- also, during this same period, cash flow from investment activities was impacted by the sale
of the UK business (other than our contract at Edinburgh Airport, which was retained but is
expected to be terminated on January 31, 2020).

For the year ended December 31, 2018, our cash flows from investment activities consisted of a
cash outflow of e25.4 million, which accounts for e1.8 million proceeds received from the sale
of the UK business (other than our contract at Edinburgh Airport, which was retained but is
expected to be terminated on January 31, 2020) to National Car Parks Limited on September 5,
2018. The total invested amount was e27.3 million, of which e2.1 million was in relation to
maintenance and capital expenditures. Additionally, the following transactions were completed
during 4Q18:

- Mendibil car park in Ir ´un (Basque Country) with an average remaining life of 44 years as of
September 30, 2019;

- El Arenal car park in Gij ´on (Asturias) with an average remaining life of 47 years as of
September 30, 2019.

For the year ended December 31, 2017, our cash flows from investment activities consisted of a
cash outflow of e27.7 million. We invested approximately e2.8 million in relation to
maintenance capital expenditures. Main concession acquisitions during this period were the
ones secured in Le ´on and Badajoz.

For the year ended December 31, 2016, our cash flows from investment activities consisted of a
cash outflow of e37.8 million, driven primarily by investments in the city of Porto, the
acquisition of EMSA—Empreendimentos e Explora¸c˜ao de Estacionamentos S.A. and SIENT and
the acquisition of several off-street assets. In addition, we invested approximately e1.8 million
in relation to maintenance and capital expenditures.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, our cash flows from financing activities
consisted of a cash outflow of e6.7 million. In August 2019 and February 2019, the Parent
Guarantor effected a distribution to its existing shareholder, Arena Ventures, by way of a net
shareholder loan repayment totaling e3.6 million and net repayments to credit institutions
totaling e3.2 million, respectively. Such shareholder loan repayments represent the most
tax-efficient option to effect shareholder distributions, and were possible due to the strong
performance and de-leveraging of the business that has led to the generation of significant
cash flows.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2018, our cash flows from financing activities
consisted of a cash outflow of e9.7 million, driven by the repayment of e8.3 million of principal
debt and e3.2 million shareholder loans. Additional debt in the amount of e1.8 million was
raised, mainly in joint venture entities.

For the year ended December 31, 2018, our cash flows from financing activities consisted of a
cash inflow of e5.9 million driven primarily by repayment of e7.8 million and an additional
debt in the amount of e13.7 million was raised.

For the year ended December 31, 2017, our cash flows from financing activities consisted of a
cash inflow of e10.9 million. Additional debt in the amount of e410.5 million was raised, while
debt in the amount of e426.9 million was amortized. Additionally, e29.4 million of interest
charges were paid.

For the year ended December 31, 2016, our cash flows from financing activities consisted of a
cash outflow of e26.9 million, driven primarily by e28.8 million in interest charges, which was
offset by raising additional debt in the amount of e1.7 million.

## Capital expenditure

Capital expenditure primarily relates to expansion capital expenditure, which is linked to the
expansion of the business (acquisition and grant of new contracts or concessions) and depends
on specific requirements from new contracts awarded. Maintenance capital expenditure has
historically represented approximately 1% of revenues and mainly relates to car park contract
requirements (mainly recurring maintenance works and repairs on car park facilities to ensure
they remain fully operational and compliant). Renewal capital expenditure relates to on-street
investments which are required in concessions near to their maturity date.

The following table sets forth our capital expenditure for the periods indicated:

20JAN202007402480

During the nine months ended September 30, 2019, our expansionary capital expenditure
related to the commencement of the construction of the Arco do Cego car park in Lisbon, with
an average remaining life of 85 years as of September 30, 2019, our acquisition of the
remaining 70% equity interest of which we did not previously own in Figueira Parques, an
on-street concessionaire with eight years of remaining life, and the acquisition of Boulevard car
park in San Sebasti´an with an average remaining life of 27 years as of September 30, 2019.

For the year ended December 31, 2018, 84.0% of our total capital expenditure was related to
our off-street concessions business, in line with our strategy. Expansionary initiatives comprised
92.3% of our Group capital expenditure, with expansionary capital expenditure increasing to
e25.2 million compared to e22.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This was mainly
due to a strong fourth quarter during which we invested an aggregate of e10.4 million in two
acquisitions:

- Mendibil car park in Ir ´un (Basque Country) with an average remaining life of 44 years as of
September 30, 2019; and

104


-----

- El Arenal car park in Gij ´on (Asturias) with an average remaining life of 47 years as of
September 30, 2019.

Maintenance capital expenditure of e2.1 million during the same period represents, at 1.0% of
adjusted revenue, our continuing plan of stable maintenance expenditure relative to adjusted
revenue.

For the year ended December 31, 2017, capital expenditure was targeted primarily in the
off-street concession sector, including acquisitions of a concession serving a hospital in Leon
with 1,662 car park spaces and a concession in Badajoz with 700 car park spaces.

## Available liquidity

As of September 30, 2019, our available funds totaled e112.8 million. This financial health is
possible due to the fact that the Off-street segment generates cash on a daily basis, which
leads to lower liquidity needs when compared to similar-sized companies.

Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents on balance sheet
(e37.8 million as of September 30, 2019) and amounts available to be drawn under our Existing
Revolving Credit Facility (which will be cancelled and replaced by the Revolving Credit Facility
on or around the Issue Date). All e75.0 million available under our Existing Revolving Credit
Facility was undrawn as of such date, and we have no intention to draw under the Revolving
Credit Facility on the Issue Date. As of September 30, 2019, our net debt was e499.1 million, of
which e449.7 million was related to Net recourse debt and e49.4 million was related to Net
non-recourse debt.

As of September 30, 2019, after giving pro forma effect to the issuance of the Notes and the
Redemption, our total indebtedness would have been e643.4 million, consisting of
e575.0 million in principal outstanding under the Notes and e68.4 million of other debt
outstanding and with e100 million available to be drawn under our Revolving Credit Facility.
See ‘‘Capitalization.’’ For further details with respect to our indebtedness, see ‘‘Description of
_Certain Financing Arrangements’’ and ‘‘Description of Notes.’’_

**_Non-recourse project finance facilities_**
As of September 30, 2019, the Non-Recourse Entities had, collectively, e53.0 million (including
accrued interest and unamortized debt issuance costs) of Project Finance Facilities, the purpose
of which are to fund the construction of the La Concha, Plaza de Catalu ˜na and Oquendo car
parks in San Sebasti´an. e29.5 million of such Project Finance Facilities are due to mature in
2029, with the remaining e23.5 million due to mature in 2035. See ‘‘Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—Project Finance Facilities.’’_

**_Lease liabilities_**
As of September 30, 2019, we had an outstanding lease liabilities of e7.2 million.

**_Performance bonds and guarantees_**
We provide performance bonds and other guarantees to grantors (usually local authorities or
municipalities) as established in the concessions agreements and to ensure other contractual
obligations. As of September 30, 2019, the aggregate amount of these performance bonds and
guarantees was e49.0 million.

**_Hedging transactions_**
Currently, we hedge our variable rate debt obligations (primarily the Project Finance Facilities
held by the Non-Recourse Entities) through the use of interest rate swaps. As of September 30,
2019, we had swaps in place to hedge outstanding variable rate debt obligations in the
notional amount of e25.4 million.

105


-----

**_Cash collections_**
As a result of day-to-day activity at our parking locations, we collect significant amounts of
cash. For our off-street concessions, we collect cash in advance for hourly, daily and monthly
charges, and use a portion of this to pay the fees to the concession owners. For our on-street
concessions, we generally collect cash daily at the time of service, with the cash in excess of our
fees remitted to the municipalities at fixed intervals. For our off-street contract management
business, we collect the cash from users and net it against payments owed from the facility
owners and pay the remainder to the facility owners as required under the contract. Some
municipalities and other clients require us to deposit the cash receipts into client accounts and
the clients then reimburse us for our fees.

**_Contractual obligations_**
The following table shows our contractual obligations due by period as of September 30, 2019
(excluding accrued interest and amortized costs), after giving pro forma effect to the issuance
of the Notes and the Redemption.

(1) Represents non-recourse project financing arrangements entered into by certain of our non-wholly owned subsidiaries to
finance the construction of parking infrastructure under concession contracts. ‘‘Non-recourse’’ means that the lenders under the
facilities have recourse only against the subsidiary that is the borrower under the arrangement (and its assets and, in some
cases, its capital stock), and not to other members of the Group. See ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Project
_Finance Facilities.’’_

(2) Represents the lease liabilities arising from (a) the leasing of our main offices in Madrid and Lisbon and the leasing of
other offices in cities where we have on-street concessions, as well as (b) the leasing of parking meters.

(3) Represents other credit lines and facilities.

(4) Does not include (1) any borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, which borrowings may be drawn, repaid and
redrawn at any time (and with respect to which we have no intention to draw on the Issue Date); and (2) annual concessionary
fees to municipalities which we are required to pay under many of our concessions. See ‘‘Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Revolving Credit Facility.’’_

We are required to pay annual concessionary fees to municipalities under many of our
concessions. Fixed fees paid to municipalities, accounting under IFRIC 12, amounted to
e7.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2019, e7.5 million in the year ended
December 31, 2018 and e3.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2017.

**_Off balance sheet arrangements_**
We do not hold any off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2019.

## Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

**_Interest rate risk_**
Our primary market risk exposure consists of risks related to changes in interest rates. The
Revolving Credit Facility and most of our local credit facilities will bear interest at variable
rates. This exposes us to fluctuations or variability in interest payments due to changes in
interest rates. If interest rates increase, our interest expense will also increase, and conversely, if
interest rates decrease, our interest expense will also decrease. Additionally, increases in
interest rates would cause financing to be more expensive for future projects and acquisitions

106


-----

and would increase the cost of our short-term debt. Currently, we hedge our variable rate
obligations through the use of interest rate swaps. We may decide to undertake hedging with
respect to the Floating Rate Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility or any other variable rate
obligations we may have outstanding in the future.

**_Foreign currency risk_**

We are exposed to foreign currency risk on those transactions or assets and liabilities that are
in a currency other than our reporting currency, the Euro. This exposure is currently limited in
our business, with our primary foreign currency exposures relating to the Turkish lira. For the
year ended December 31, 2018, our operations in Turkey amounted to 1.3% of our revenues.

**_Liquidity risk_**
Liquidity risk is the risk of not being able to fulfill present or future obligations if we do not
have sufficient funds available to meet such obligations. Liquidity risk arises mostly in relation
to cash flows generated and used in financing activities, and particularly by servicing our debt,
in terms of both interest and capital, and our payment obligations relating to our ordinary
business activities.

We believe that the potential risks to our liquidity include:

- a reduction in operating cash flows due to a lowering of revenues from our operations,
which could be due to downturns in our performance or the industry as a whole;

- adverse working capital developments; and

- exposure to increased interest rates in relation to our borrowings that bear interest at a
variable rate, including the Floating Rate Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility.

If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources (including borrowings
under the Revolving Credit Facility) are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to
fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to:

- reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditures;

- reduce or delay our planned acquisitions;

- sell assets;

- obtain additional debt or equity capital; or

- restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before
maturity.

We cannot assure you that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a
timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all. In addition, the terms of our debt, including the
Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility, limit our ability to pursue these alternatives, as may the
terms of any future debt.

## Critical Accounting Policies

This ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations’’
discusses our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with
IFRS. Accounting estimates are an integral part of the preparation of the financial statements
and the financial reporting process and are based upon current judgments. The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. Certain accounting estimates

107


-----

are particularly sensitive because of their complexity and the possibility that future events
affecting them may differ materially from our current judgments and estimates.

This listing of critical accounting policies is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all our
accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is
specifically dictated by IFRS, with no need for management’s judgment regarding accounting
policy. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, the following policies may involve
a higher degree of judgment and complexity.

**_Revenue and cost recognition_**
We recognize revenue when it can be reliably valued and it is probable that we will receive the
funds. In the case of our off-street concession business, this occurs when we receive fees from
our clients, which are recognized on an accrual basis for season ticket holders. In the case of
our on-street concession business and off-street contract management business, revenue is
recognized at the time the service is provided based on the set fee we are entitled to receive
plus, in most cases, the incentive payment, which is based on the funds collected. We must
make a calculation in order to determine the amount of revenue earned as an incentive
payment, and sometimes we also need to determine if and how to allocate certain costs, which
can involve judgment on the part of management.

When we sell off-street parking spaces, we recognize both expenses and revenues at the time
of delivery, which is generally when the contract is signed. This requires us to allocate costs of
a particular project to the space at such time. Generally, we allocate costs by allocating the
construction cost associated with the parking spaces sold. We perform this allocation based on
an engineering report prepared by an external advisor.

**_Impairment of goodwill_**
We perform a yearly impairment test to identify any instances where book value is greater
than the recoverable value of goodwill. Since our goodwill consists of individual car parks
acquired upon prior acquisitions, we calculate impairment by comparing the value of these
assets with fair value. Typically fair value is based on the price at which the asset could be sold,
but since there is often no relevant market comparison, especially for concessions, we typically
use a discounted future cash flow model in this analysis. This model requires us to make
assumptions about estimated future cash flow, the risk-free discount rate, the risk of the asset
and market premium. Additionally, we include in our model an estimate of any residual value
based on renewal of the contract and growth. If any discrepancies are identified in the course
of our annual impairment testing, we write-down book value to the fair value of the asset.

**_Taxes_**
We recognize income taxes based on both the current taxes and any deferred taxes that relate
to the current period. Due to differences in depreciation and other accounting policies used in
determining our income taxes, our tax payments often occur in a different period than the
period in which profits are recognized for accounting purposes. We recognize assets or
liabilities for amounts expected to be paid or recovered from tax authorities. In making these
determinations we only recognize tax assets to the extent that we believe there will be future
taxable profits which could be used to compensate for temporary differences. For these
purposes, we must make calculations relating to when expense items will be recognized for tax
purposes and whether our future income will be sufficient to allow us to use such deductions
and tax credits recognized as assets.

## Introduction

Parking plays a pivotal role in transportation, building design, quality of life and environmental
issues. Generally, the parking infrastructure and management business, and in particular the
concession- based portion of the industry, has lower demand risk and limited direct
competition. Additionally, the industry benefits from a degree of regulatory protection and
stability because it provides a critical service to municipalities. The number of car parking
spaces has been growing in Iberia mainly driven by GDP growth as well as a result of the
increase in urbanization and an increase in the number of cars. The profitability of the sector is
generally improving, supported by scale efficiencies, the implementation of cost savings
programs and the utilization of innovative industry technology, among others.

## Market segmentation

The car park industry can be divided into three general categories:

- Off-street concessions: Consists of parking in purpose-built facilities which can be located on
private land or, more commonly, commissioned by the local authority on public land as part
of its urban planning activities. Users can rent car park spaces by the minute, hour, day,
week, month or year. Parking spaces may also be sold to local residents for a single
lump-sum payment. Concessions are awarded via a public tender process and often require
the winning party to build or upgrade a parking facility. Given the required initial capital
investment, off- street concessions generally have longer terms than on-street concessions,
typically up to 20 to 50 years, depending on the type of contract. A concession agreement
regulates the tariff which can be charged by the concessionaire, which is linked to inflation
or another agreed formula.

- On-street concessions: Consists of parking in dedicated parking bays located ‘‘on the street.’’
As part of its urban planning activities, municipalities will identify parking zones which are
reserved for local residents, zones available for general parking and zones for mixed use.
Municipalities limit the area of on-street car parking and generally outsource the
management and enforcement of on-street parking to specialized firms via a public tender
process. If a concessionaire wins a public tender for an on-street concession, it normally will
not face any competition for that concession until the concession agreement expires and a
new awardee starts to operate the service. On-street concession length typically runs from
five to 20 years and are typically structured either on a ‘‘cost plus fee’’ basis with low
demand risk, or on a basis where the concessionaire pays an up-front fee to the municipality
but retains all the on-street revenue and therefore bears demand risk.

109


-----

- Off-street contract management: Off-street contract management activities consist of private
or public entities outsourcing the day-to-day management of off-street parking facilities.
These contracts tend to have more variable terms than concessions and generally are for
shorter terms. Additionally, the bidding process for these contracts is more competitive and,
as a result, margins on these contracts tend to be lower than with concessions. Off-street
contract management arrangements with private entities are typically structured so that the
parking operator pays an annual rental charge to the parking infrastructure owner and in
return retains all the revenue, effectively bearing all the demand risk. Contracts with public
or quasi-public entities typically carry less demand risk because the operator’s compensation
is primarily an annual inflation-linked fee for managing the parking operation.

The off-street concession business is the Group’s largest business line, representing 56.5% of its
Adjusted Revenue and 83.9% of its Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended
September 30, 2019. The on-street concession and the off-street contract management business
lines represented 35.5% and 8.0% of the Group’s Adjusted Revenue, respectively.

The on-street concession business line represented 16.5% of the Group’s Adjusted EBITDA in
the twelve months ended September 30, 2019. The Group’s off-street contract management
business did not affect its Adjusted EBITDA in a meaningful way in the twelve months ended
September 30, 2019.

## Business models

The major off-street car park companies mainly operate under one of two separate businesses:

- Concessionaire: Under the concessionaire model, the operator constructs the facility which is
referred to as a ‘‘green field’’ concession or pays a fee to the municipality for an existing
facility which is referred to as a ‘‘brown field’’ concession and enters into an agreement with
the municipality for the exclusive right to operate, maintain and invest in car parking
activities for a given number of years. The concessionaire generally pays an upfront fixed
sum or an annual fee (which can be fixed and/or be based on a percentage of revenue) to
the municipalities.

- Car park operator: Under the car park operator model, the operator enters into a contract
management arrangement with a private client to operate the parking facility. Typically, the
operator collects the revenues generated from users and pays the client a fixed fee or a fee
plus a percentage of revenues. Therefore, the operator retains most of the demand risk,
which can result in lower revenues and margins during economic downturns, because in
many cases parking facilities owned by private clients are not located in as favorable
locations as facilities developed by municipalities and other public authorities.

These two business models have significant differences, with the concessionaire model
generally requiring an initial investment in exchange for concessions with higher margins,
longer terms and generally lower levels of demand risk. The car park operator business model
is subject to more intense competition due to lower barriers to entry and short contract
duration. We operate primarily under the concessionaire model. Due to the fundamental
differences between the models, we believe the car park operator model is not fully
representative of our business and we believe our business more closely resembles the business
of infrastructure companies operating under long-term concessions.

## Key characteristics of the concessionaire car park industry

The concessionaire car park industry benefits from several characteristics that are exhibited by
infrastructure assets:

- Limited direct competition: We believe that car park users typically do not park more than a
short walk from their ultimate destination. Therefore, for off-street parking facilities,
competition is essentially on a street-by-street basis, restricted to small geographic areas near
the parking facility which tends to be limited, especially for prime locations in city centers.
For on-street activities, the typical concession provides for a territory defined by the
municipality and, as such, there is no competition for other public on-street parking. For
off-street activities, planning permission for ‘‘green field’’ developments is generally difficult
for developers to obtain given limited space. As a result, competition between industry
players is normally focused on the tender process. Once a tender is awarded, operators are
generally able to accurately estimate demand for their parking facilities.

- An essential asset for municipalities in the Mobility play: Parking, in all its forms, has become
a fundamental amenity used by municipalities in city Mobility planning and for transit
regulation, especially as oversights in planning can lead to negative consequences on the

111


-----

traffic and functionality of the city. Local governments in Europe have increased the amount
of overall area used for parking under management which includes both regulated on-street
areas and areas off public thorough fares. Beyond city Mobility planning, municipalities look
to parking as one of the most basic and essential services they provide to businesses,
commuters and tourists. Parking also provides a reliable source of revenue for municipalities,
with low capital intensity. As a result, municipalities have a vested interest in ensuring the
availability and reliability of high-quality parking in their jurisdictions, creating opportunities
for the car park industry to continue to expand as part of one of the key drivers for Mobility.

- Nature of customer base: We believe that the off-street parking categories of the car park
industry mainly cater to more affluent individuals such as professionals and other skilled
workers that commute daily to their workplaces and require parking spaces on a recurring
basis. Demand from this segment of the workforce tends to have a low level of elasticity and
contributes to the stability of volumes and revenues even during economic downturns.

- Capital intensity: For off-street parking concessions, there is typically a large initial capital
outlay in order to build the facilities; however, relatively low levels of capital expenditures
are required to maintain the facilities over the term of the contract. Minimal capital is
required for on-street parking concessions.

- Manageable operating cash costs: The car park operator’s ongoing cash cost base consists
primarily of labor costs, which can be increased or decreased with some flexibility, especially
when compared to other infrastructure assets. This labor flexibility can provide potential cost
savings when employee productivity increases with technology.

- Regulatory regime: Concessions are governed by public laws and regulations in Spain,
Portugal, Andorra and Turkey are similar to those that govern toll roads and other public
concessions. As a result, concessionaires, unlike car park operators, have benefitted from
financial rebalancing provisions contained in such laws and in Terms of Tender in some
circumstances. These provisions require the municipality to compensate the concessionaire
(amending the contract) if fundamental changes occur in the economic arrangements of the
contract after its execution. See ‘‘Regulation.’’

- Demand risk: Demand risk for parking operators is primarily driven by location and contract
type. On-street parking concessions typically have low demand risk since the operator’s
income is primarily based on a fixed fee. Off-street parking concessions have a higher
demand risk that is closely tied to location, however, for attractive locations in city centers or
near hospitals or other locations with consistent traffic, demand risk is lower.

## Spanish car park industry

The car park industry in Spain has a long history, with concessions going back to the 1960s.

The Spanish Association of Car Parks and Garages (ASESGA), which was formed in 1977, has
over 1,000 company members that manage circa 950,000 parking spaces in circa 1,700 lots,
garages or parking zones in Spain. According to the DBK Report in 2018, there were circa
1.5 million on-street and off- street parking spaces throughout Spain, 49% of which are
on-street parking and 51% of which are off-street parking, including car parks in residential
areas, short-term parking structures in hospitals, airports and shopping centers among others.
There has been an increase in the supply of parking spaces in Spain in response to, among
others, rising population levels in urban areas and an increase in automobiles.

According to the European Commission (‘‘EC’’) in 2018, Spain accounted for 8.9% of all the
registered cars throughout the European Union. Thanks to the economic recovery of the
Spanish economy and the reduction in its unemployment rate, the purchase of new
automobiles in Spain has increased at a higher rate than the EU average. The EC reported that
in 2018 Spain accounted for approximately 1.3 million new passenger car registrations, which

112


-----

represented 8.7% of all new passenger car registrations in the Europe Union (ranked 5th after
Germany, the UK, France and Italy).

According to the DBK Report, the car park industry in Spain has a market size of e1,050 million
measured by recurring revenue in 2018. For purposes of this ‘‘Industry’’ section, recurring
revenue refers only to rentals and excludes sales of parking spaces, publicity or other revenue.
The DBK Report estimates that in 2018, the five largest parking operators accounted for
roughly 50% of the total market by number of spaces. Additionally, there is a large ‘‘tail’’ of
smaller participants with highly localized operations.

On-street parking is increasing in Spain, as it is commonly becoming an important component
of urban planning. We have also observed a trend towards outsourcing the management of
facilities in public places such as shopping centers, hospitals, train stations and universities. The
autonomous communities of Catalu ˜na, Madrid and Andaluc´ıa in Spain account for the largest
concentration of off-street parking spaces, totaling 47% of all operating parking spaces as of
2018 in Iberia. The autonomous communities of Lisbon in Portugal and Valencia in Spain
account for the second highest concentration, with 9% and 7% of the total amount,
respectively, in 2018.

As indicated by the charts below, according to the DBK Report, the car park industry in Spain
exhibited resiliency during the economic downturn, experiencing only minor decreases in
market size between 2007 and 2013 at a CAGR of (1.3%). After reaching a floor in 2013, the
Spanish car park market has grown at a CAGR of 3.1% from 2014 to 2018, in line with the
growth of Spain’s GDP, with off-street parking spaces contributing approximately 72% of the
total market.

Even though the number of cars has remained relatively stable since 2011, the evolution of
new registrations due to car renewals has been very positive with an accumulated growth of
83% for the period from 2013 to 2018.

## Portuguese car park industry

In Portugal, the development of the car park industry began to accelerate in the 1990s with
the initiation of municipal auctions for car park concessions. According to the DBK Report, in
2016 there were 225 car park companies in Portugal managing 295,000 park spaces, out of
which 180,000 are off-street parking spaces and 110,000 regulated on-street parking spaces. In
2017, the EC reported that there were 5.1 million cars in Portugal, with the total number of
cars growing at a CAGR of 3.5% compared to 2015. The cities of Lisbon and Porto accounted
for over 36% of total vehicles in 2018 (DBK).


In 2018, the total market size measured by revenue of the car park industry was e124 million.

114


-----

Of 2018 turnover in the industry, 67% came from off-street parking management. The car
parking market in Portugal is geographically concentrated, principally in the area of Lisbon,
which accounted for 11% of total off-street parking spaces in 2018 in the Iberian region.
Construction projects for new car parks in other areas have also been completed in recent
years, and there is increasing expansion of regulated on-street parking in mid-size towns. The
number of car parking spaces in Portugal has remained stable for the period from 2012 to
2018 with almost the same amount of spaces however the mix between off- and on-street
spaces has changed slightly.

The charts below exhibit the strong growth the Portuguese car park industry market
experienced before the economic downturn and the resiliency of the industry during the last
several years.


The car market in Portugal has rebounded in recent years growing at a CAGR of 4.2% from the
low in 2014 to 2018 on the back of macroeconomic recovery, resulting in a 4.4% CAGR growth
between 2011 and 2018. The park market in Portugal has surpassed the previous peak of
e116 million reached in 2010, proving good momentum to the market, with off-street parking
contributing approximately 67% of the total market.

## Competition in Iberia

We compete with a range of large, medium and small-sized operators in each of our three
business lines. Many of our competitors have larger proportions of on-street concessions and
off-street contract management, in particular with private entities. Additionally, many of our
competitors focus on specific regions of Iberia. Competition tends to depend on the nature of
the contract or concession.

We believe that most customers generally do not park more than a short walk away from their
destination, and competition tends to be concentrated in small areas. Accordingly, the
competition between different parking options is limited, especially in city centers and other
densely populated areas. Our experience has been that competition in Spain and Portugal from
new car parks is limited given the difficulties and economic impracticality of building new
facilities in prime locations.

Additionally, given the high level of car usage and limited alternative forms of transport, there
is limited competition from public transportation. Due to these factors, the primary area of
competition among different car park operators is in winning new concessions and renewing
existing concessions. For off-street parking concessions, competition is essentially on a
street-by-street basis with on-street parking and off-street parking alternatives. Competition is
minimal for prime locations since the high density of city centers and planning regulations
make the approval process for ‘‘green field’’ car parks difficult. Therefore, concession operators,
especially those in prime locations, typically face limited competition within the local area near
the facility.

For on-street parking concessions, there are several barriers to entry such as the required
technology and relevant administrative qualifications. As a result, the on-street parking
concession business is concentrated among a limited number of operators, one of which is
Empark. Once an operator has won a concession after a public competitive process, the
operator is granted exclusive rights on the on-street parking within the concession area.
Additionally, since fixed fees form a significant part of the relevant remuneration of on-street
concessions, the according exposure to demand risk is limited.

The off-street contract management sector has lower barriers to entry than on-street parking
concessions and competition among operators for contracts is more intense. Similarly to
on-street parking concessions, the remuneration under the contracts tends to come more from
fixed fees, so the operators have limited exposure to demand risk. Additionally, for contracts in
certain locations such as airports and ferries (which are the types of contracts Empark has in
this sector), the parking facility typically has no direct competition in the area.

The following charts show the market share, by car parking spaces, of the five largest
operators of parking facilities in Iberia in 2018:

Empark is the market leader in the Iberian car parks industry by number of spaces, and was the
number one car park operator in Spain by number of spaces, for the year ended December 31,
2018.

The Iberian car park market is in the process of market consolidation. According to the DBK
report, this process has already started, with the number of parking companies being reduced
in the past two years, on the back of the acquisitions of smaller operators by the market
leaders, as well as the loss of concessions of the smaller companies, who had lesser resources to
compete for the contracts. However, the Iberian market remains highly fragmented, with 50%
of market not being consolidated by number of spaces, providing headroom for economies of
scale and for further consolidation.

## Market development

Several factors are expected to impact the development of the car park industry in Europe and
Iberia. These are economic growth, urbanization and growth of car park industry performance,
new mobility, city policies and sustainability, and digitalization and big data, among others.

- Economic growth: Parking demand and growth is primarily driven by macroeconomic factors
including gross domestic product (‘‘GDP’’) and inflation. GDP growth is the main
macroeconomic factor impacting disposable income, and therefore, retail, business traffic,
petrol, consumption and car parks. Despite Eurozone slowdown, Iberia is expected to
continue growing at circa 2% levels of real GDP.

- Urbanization and continued growth of car park industry performance: Empark is the leading
player in the Iberian car park market in terms of number of spaces. The car park industry has
an inherent growth factor on the back of the continued increase in urbanization. As
population levels grow in the cities, the number of cars tends to increase leading to higher
demand for parking, especially in city centers where the supply is rigid due to the difficulties
of developing new infrastructure in these areas. Over the last decade, the number of people
in urban areas has increased to circa 70% of the European population (Source: European
Environment Agency). According to the DBK report, the total number of cars in Iberia
accumulates a 16% growth between 2005 and 2017, with an average growth per annum on
2016 and 2017 of circa 3% in Iberia. Correspondingly, the total car park market has grown at
a CAGR of 3.2% between 2016 and 2018 supported by the growth of the off-street sector,
with a CAGR of 4.0% between 2016 and 2018 and has a positive outlook for 2020, with an
estimated growth of 2.4% CAGR 2018-2020.

- New mobility: Electric and autonomous cars, shared mobility and last mile logistics, as
components of the new mobility wave, have the potential to disrupt the car park industry,
but also offer numerous opportunities for the different players.

118


-----

  - Electric vehicles (‘‘EV’’) are perceived as one of the major positive disruptors in
transportation, and the proportion of EVs among the total car fleet is expected to
significantly increase in the coming years. The adoption of EV is mainly influenced by
cost competitiveness, autonomy of the cars, and charging time reduction. With respect to
cost, prices for EV are increasingly competitive, on the back of batteries cost decreasing
in time (they currently represent circa 40% of the total EV costs). Battery density
improvements will increase EV autonomy, another major focus area. EV have an average
autonomy of 400km, and is expected to exceed 600-700km by 2030. The most
predominant adoption factor today is the reduction of charging time. The improvement
of charging lies on numerous technical improvements, such as cooling system, improved
chemistry, connections adaptation and upgraded distribution networks. Off-street
parking is a prime location for charging vehicles with car park operators compensated
for use of the charging stations. This can result in opportunities for larger parking
operators to work with local municipalities to provide citywide solutions. Empark has
significantly increased its charging base since 2018.

  - Autonomous vehicles (‘‘AV’’) are expected to be part of the next Mobility wave, which
according to experts, is estimated to happen significantly after 2025 or later. The
introduction of AV in the transport industry constitute new opportunities for the car
park industry in general, mainly by increasing the car park capacity. AVs could benefit car
parking operators with a technological platform able to accommodate the new
technology for AVs in the long-term. Technologies under development include systems
enabling AVs to know where off-street car parks are located and drive autonomously to
the available locations. Only car park operators connected to a digital platform will take
advantage of self-driving-cars. It is also relevant to mention that AVs will mostly be EV as
well, which will imply a further need for charging stations in the car parks, once this
technology is established. In this scenario, Empark should be positively impacted on the
back of its forefront position in EV charging.

  - Car sharing: The declining importance of private car ownership and increase in car
sharing is expected to have a mixed impact on the car park industry, with limited impact
in smaller cities compared to urban areas due to the required scale for car sharing and
potential traffic control aimed at discouraging private car use. Car sharing can result in
lower levels of private-cars purchased and thus end demand for car parks. However, car
parks will be the natural destination to pick-up and park a shared vehicle. In any case,
the car sharing industry is under transformation as some relevant players like DriveNow
have announced their withdrawal from cities like London.

  - Last mile logistics: Car park operators can take advantage of its presence at core
locations in the cities, to become an intermediary employed by logistic platforms, for a
wide variety of unrelated car park services, such as package drop-of or cross-docking.

- City policies and sustainability: The European Commission presented a strategic long-term
vision on November 2018, called 2050 Target, focused on the idea of a climate-neutral
Europe by 2050. Part of the strategy to achieve this objective will be to reach zero emissions
by year 2050. As a result, environmental sustainability is expected to be an even more
important topic on city council agendas than it is already. A way for city councils to limit
pollution and improve air quality is to control the volume and flow of traffic within these
cities; and one of the tools for that is parking planning and parking pricing. Other tools
include the improvement of the transport system efficiency, speed up the deployment of low
emission alternative energies used for transport (hydrogen, advanced biofuels, etc.) or the
imposition of fines to car manufacturers for excessive emissions.

Key actions from city councils expected in the short, medium and long-term to improve air
quality are outlined below.

- Digitalization and big data: The car park industry has begun to develop technologies that
lead to more profitable and efficient operations, and respond in a better and more effective
way to user needs. Innovations in the automation of car park management systems,
electronic payments systems and advancements in centralized control systems and operations
are important developments in off-street parking facilities, which reduce the amount of labor
required, making management more efficient and effective. Technology platforms are
utilized for our on-street parking operations and help us manage more efficiently the area
covered by the concession. These technological developments embedded into our car park
offer can be referred to as ‘‘Smart Parking.’’ Smart Parking will also benefit the car park
industry by providing customers with a new range of value-added services, which could
include for instance:

  - For e-Commerce, car park becoming a parcel drop-off location.

  - For peer-to-peer car rentals, car park becoming a platform where users pick-up / park /
drop-off the car.

  - For EVs, becoming a ‘‘vehicle to grid’’ platform allowing energy stored in electric vehicles
to be fed back into the national electricity network to help supply energy at times of
peak demand.

  - For advertising, offering new products such as interactive advertising and shopping
panels.

These services can result in increased revenue sources and higher levels of customer satisfaction
and loyalty.

Below is an illustration of how our Smart Parking Service functions. Sensors detect in real-time
parking space occupancy, allowing users of our smartphone app to find the spaces more easily
and pay directly through the app.

# Regulation

The following is a brief summary of the regulatory regimes of Spain and Portugal applicable to
our business.

**_General_**
Car parks in Spain may be developed either privately or through the public concessionary
regime. Car parks developed through the public concessionary regime are usually located on
publicly owned land and involve the exercise of public administrative powers (principally by
municipalities). The legal regime governing car parks developed through the public
concessionary regime is more complex than that for private car parks. This is the reason why
this section is almost entirely devoted to car parks developed through the public concessionary
regime. The operation of public car parks, which is usually granted to private parties under
administrative concessions, is subject to the ongoing control of the public authorities that grant
the concessions.

Car parks that are privately developed are usually built on privately owned land and are
subject to a less complex regulatory regime than the regime applicable to car parks developed
through the public concessionary regime.

Law 40/2002 of November 14 (‘‘Law 40/2002’’) regulates car park agreements between the cark
park operators and end consumers and sets forth the duties of car park operators and their
liabilities for personal injury and property damage.

Under the relevant Spanish laws, the operator of a parking facility is liable for any damages to
the vehicle and its contents when certain conditions are met, including that movable
components, accessories or objects are expressly declared by the user, that the provider of
parking services expressly accepts their custody, and that the user complies with security
measures.

**_Off-street Car Parks_**
Off-street car parks can be classified as follows:

a) Ownership: The asset is owned by the company and is freely operated exclusively for its
own benefit. A parking contract with end users is ruled by Law 40/2002 on vehicle parking
which (since its amendment by means of Law 44/2006) sets forth that the price to be paid
by the user must be established by minutes of parking use without being able to charge
for parking time that has not been consumed. Law 40/2002 sets forth the duties of car
park operators and their liabilities for personal injury and property damage. In particular,
according to the law, the operator of a parking facility is liable for any damages to the
vehicle and its contents provided certain conditions are met.

b) Contract with a third party (public or private body):

i. Public contracts are typically awarded by municipalities who ‘‘own’’ the (car park)
public service. Public contracts may be classified as follows.

    - Public Works Concession: The concessionaire constructs and further exploits the car
park or it only operates the car park already constructed.

       - Those subject to the Law of Contracts with Public Authorities, a consolidated
text approved by Legislative Royal Decree 2/2000 of June 16 (‘‘TRLCAP’’) may
have a maximum term of: (i) 40 years if they are concessions for construction
and operation or (ii) 20 years if they are concessions only for the operation of
the car park.

122


-----

     - Those subject to Public Procurement Law 3/2011 (‘‘Law 3/2011’’) may have a
maximum term of 40 years.

    - Those subject to the current Public Procurement (Law 9/2017,)—must have a
limited duration, which is calculated in the procurement documents on the basis
of the relevant works and the investment to be recovered. If the term of the
contract exceeds five years, the maximum duration may not exceed the time
calculated as reasonable for the concessionaire to recover the investments made
for the exploitation of the works together with a return on the capital invested,
taking into account the investments necessary to achieve the specific contractual
objectives. In any case, the maximum duration of works concession contracts
cannot exceed 40 years.

   - Concession for the management of a public service (which may also include carrying
out some works).

    - Those subject to the Public Procurement Law 923/1965 may have a maximum
term of 99 years.

    - Those subject to the Public Procurement Law 13/1995 may have a maximum term
of 75 years.

    - Those subject to the TRLCAP or to Public Procurement Law 3/2011 may have a
maximum term of: (i) 50 years if they include construction and management or
(ii) 25 years if they are concessions only for the management of the car park.

Some of these contracts include a Public Domain Concession granted under the
Public Assets Law 33/2003, which may have a maximum term of 75 years. As a
consequence, the maximum duration for those contracts is 75 years.

   - Service concessions or simply service contracts: Pursuant to the current public
procurement Law 9/2017, public contracts related to car parking services could be
regulated under ‘‘service concessions’’ (which may also include carrying out works
related with the car parking infrastructure) or simply ‘‘service contracts.’’

As previously said, pursuant to the current public procurement Law 9/2017, the
service concession may entail the execution of works, in which case the maximum
duration of the contract will be 40 years. Otherwise, the duration of the services
concession may be up to a maximum of 25 years. Beyond this, provisions for
establishing duration are the same as for works concessions.

As a general rule, the service contracts subject to public procurement law 9/2017
may have a maximum term of five years. In exceptional cases, where the
amortization of the investment is a key factor for the provision of the services, the
terms of the contract may establish a higher maximum term.

ii. Private ‘‘Concessions’’ comprise contracts with a private entity to build and/or operate a
car park, the contract being subject to private common civil or commercial law and not
subject to specific term constraints (nor are they derived from the regulations on public
contracts).

iii. Management contracts comprise private contracts awarded by a public or by a private
entity. If the awarding entity is a public entity regulations on public contracts shall
apply to the awarding process, but the terms and conditions under which the contract
is executed are those set out in the contract itself and, accordingly, common civil or
commercial law will apply. Thus, management contracts are not subject to any
maximum term (nor are they derived from the regulations on public contracts). This

123


-----

conclusion may be slightly modified when the award entity is an entity within the
public sector.

**_On-street Car Parks_**
Municipalities are the ‘‘owners’’ of the on-street car park public service. Thus, its operation or
management always derives from a contract awarded by a municipality. On-street car parks fall
under the following categories:

a) Concession for the management of a public service. According to the Spanish Public Sector
Contracts (Real Decreto Legislativo 3/2011, de 11 de noviembre, por el que se aprueba el
_texto refundido de la Ley de Contratos del Sector P´ublico) (the ‘‘TRLCSP’’), these contracts_
may have a maximum term of 25 years. Note that these contracts are those which have
been awarded from the entry into force of the TRLCSP until the entry into force of
Law 9/2017.

b) Service contract: The operator provides a service and receives a payment in exchange.
According to the TRLCSP, these contracts may have a maximum term of four years with a
possible extension of two additional years.

c) Service Concession or simply Service contract (governed by Law 9/2017). Please, refer to
‘‘Off-street car park’’ section above.

**_Legal framework_**
The construction and operation of off-street parking facilities and the provision of on-street
parking services pursuant to contracts awarded by public authorities are regulated by public
procurement regulations currently, Law 9/2017. (Contracts awarded prior to the effectiveness of
Law 9/2017 are governed by the public procurement legislation in force when such contracts
were awarded: TRLCSP, Public Sector Contracts Law, 30/2007 of October 30, TRLCAP,
Law 13/1995 of May 18, on Contracts with the Public Authorities or Decree 923/1965, dated
April 8, approving the State Contract Law.

In addition, contracts entered into with municipalities are also usually governed by the
regulation ruling local entities services, approved by the Decree of June 17, 1955, as currently
in force. In addition, certain regions of Spain have enacted their own legislation. For example,
in the Catalonian autonomous region, Decree 179/1995 of June 13, approves the regulation of
local entities works, activities and services (‘‘ROAS’’).

Also, concessions are governed by the corresponding contractual documents which may include
additional requirements to those foreseen in said regulations, such as specific corporate
requirements for the concessionaire or change of control provisions.

**_Public tender process and award_**
Concessions for the construction and/or management of public car parks, as well as for the
provision of on-street parking services, are awarded through a public tender process. In this
public tender process, interested parties may submit their bids for the contract. The specific
conditions of the contract are set forth in the Terms of Tender and in the contract itself. These
conditions may differ and establish particular legal, economic and technical terms for each type
of contract and for each project without prejudice to the application of the relevant public
procurement legislation in force at the time the contract is awarded.

**_Term and renewal of public contracts_**
Within the maximum term established by the relevant applicable law, each particular contract
will have the duration of the contract set out in the Terms of Tender approved for the
contract.

124


-----

Additionally, the contractual term may only be extended under the circumstances set out in the
Terms of Tender and within the maximum extension terms mentioned therein and in the
applicable regulations. However, the concessionaire does not have a right to such an extension;
the Administration may grant it or not and provided it is so allowed by the applicable
regulations and the Terms of Tender.

The regulations on public contracts are becoming increasingly stringent as far as the extension
of public concessions is concerned and so are consequently the different administrations. These
restrictions are currently included in the public procurement law 9/2017.

Upon expiration of the contractual term (and its possible extensions, which necessarily need to
be granted or agreed in writing) the contract is terminated. The authority will then decide
whether it wants to award a new contract in a new open tender process or if it prefers to
provide the car-park service directly itself.

**_Powers of the awarding authority_**
The awarding authority is entitled to interpret the concession contract, resolve any doubt
regarding its execution, modify it for reasons of public interest, terminate it early and
determine the effects of such termination. Decisions adopted by the awarding authority are
immediately enforceable (even if the concessionaire is allowed to challenge such decision
before the tribunals and to request their precautionary suspension).

The right for the awarding authority to amend the contract must be duly justified in public
interest reasons that may affect the characteristics of the service provision or the tariffs to be
paid by users. If the modification affects the financial contractual regime, the administration
may have to compensate the concessionaire in order to maintain the financial balance of the
concession.

**_Restoring of the economic balance_**
Concessions are subject to risk (and venture) assumed by the concessionaire, which basically
means that the concessionaire runs the business at his own risk, including the need to carry out
at his own expenses certain investments such as technological updates, and is only entitled to
request a compensation if any of the following events occur (the administration may also
initiate a proceeding to re-balance the concession for its own benefit):

(a) ‘‘Ius variandi’’: mentioned above (please refer to section -Powers of the awarding
_authority)._

(b) ‘‘Factum principis’’: Any other action carried out by the public administration not directly
modifying the contract but which directly produces a ‘‘substantial imbalance’’ in the
contractual economics (for example, under certain circumstances, the opening by the same
administration of another car park which competes with the one awarded). Pursuant to
the current public procurement law 9/2017, factum principis may only be applied when the
contracting authority is the public administration which has carried out the action
producing the ‘‘substantial imbalance.’’ There is uncertainty as to whether the case-law
issued on the basis of the former public procurement regulations—which states that
factum principis could also be applied in those cases where the action producing the
‘‘substantial imbalance’’ is issued by public authorities other than the contracting
authority—remains applicable.

(c) Unpredictable risk: Any unforeseeable event, in which none of the contracting parties
intervenes, which produces a ‘‘substantial imbalance’’ in the contractual economics. In these
events, the ‘‘risk’’ is shared by both the administration and concessionaire, who will not be
entirely compensated. There is uncertainty as to whether the case-law issued on the basis
of the former public procurement regulations remains applicable.

(d) Force majeure.

125


-----

These causes for the restoring of the economic imbalance may be ruled by the Terms of Tender,
which may include certain particularities or modulations, without prejudice to the application
of the relevant public procurement legislation in force at the time the contract is awarded.

Compensation, which can eventually also take place in favor of the administration, may include
a modification of the tariffs to be paid by the users, the shortening or extension of the
contractual term or any other modification of the economic clauses contained in the contract.
As said above, the extension of the contractual term has been restricted in the most recent
regulations and can only be applicable under the circumstances set forth in Law 9/2017 when
the contract at stake is subject to the latter.

**_Concession tariffs and other remuneration arrangements_**
The Terms of Tender and the contract establish the tariff scheme to remunerate the
concessionaire. In exchange for operating the car parks, the concessionaires are generally
required to pay a fee to the granting authority.

Usually off-street car parks are remunerated in accordance with the use of the parking spaces.
Thus, short-term parking spaces (rotaci´on) are usually remunerated by a regulated tariff. The
right of the concessionaire to increase the tariffs to be paid by end users depends on what it is
set forth in the contract and in the Terms of Tender. Traditionally, amendments to tariffs had
been linked to the national, regional or sectorial Consumer Price Index.

However, the Spanish Economy De-indexation Law, approved on March 30, 2015, provides new
rules for the review of monetary values in the contracts in which the public sector intervenes,
establishing a regime based on the principle of said monetary values not being modified by
virtue of price indexes or formulas that contain the same. In any event, this new regulation has
no retroactive effect and should not affect contracts awarded before its enforcement.

In addition to the tariffs for the rotary use of the car park, as an ancillary activity, the
concessionaire is in some cases allowed to sell the right of permanent use for a certain number
of years of a limited number of parking spaces to local residents for a price established in the
contract, in accordance with the Terms of Tender. Note that in some concessions there is a ratio
between rotation and assignment of use that is compulsory for the concessionaire. It is also
permitted in many concessions to sell subscriptions to users for shorter terms (monthly, weekly
or daily passes, among others).

Other sources of income may be advertising within the car park, assignment of certain parking
spots to specific users such as hotels, or the implementation of ancillary activities such as car
washing.

However, these additional sources of income may be limited by the Terms of Tender or even
forbidden. Note that the concessionaire may also be required to assign some parking spots to
the granting authorities free of charge as part of the contractual arrangements.

On-street concessionaires are generally remunerated through a flat fee or by reference to a
percentage of the amount collected for the provision of the service less costs. Increase of tariffs
to be paid by end users need to be authorized by the granting authority.

The Terms of Tender and the contract establish the fee scheme that the concessionaire has to
pay to the granting authority. This fee may be due with certain regularity or may be payable
upfront. Failure to comply with fee requirements is generally a cause of termination of the
concession.

**_Assignment of the concessions and change of control_**
Traditionally, the assignment of the concession is in general, subject to the prior granting
authority’s consent, to be granted after having verified that all requirements are met. The most

126


-----

relevant requirement is that the assignee shall evidence before the granting authority that it
has the ability to operate the concession.

The transfer of the concessionaire’s shares (implying or not a direct change of control) is in
general not expressly foreseen in the contractual documentation or in the relevant
procurement regulations. However, in some cases, restrictions apply (e.g. obligation to notify or
to obtain prior approval).

Indirect transfer of the concessionaire’s shares (indirect change of control) is in general not
expressly foreseen in the contractual documentation or in the relevant procurement regulations
(e.g. port regulations do refer to this). However, in some cases the granting authority may
understand that an indirect change of control is subject to its prior approval when it implies a
change of control.

This interpretation is often based on the Spanish State Council doctrine set out in its
report 3375/2001, in which it considered that the transfer of a controlling stake in the
concessionaire may be considered to be a transfer of the concession, for which consent is
required.

Other corporate transactions may also be subject to specific requirements.

In addition, it should be noted that concessions entered into with the City Councils located in
Catalonia are governed by the ROAS. According to the ROAS, the transfer of the shares of the
concessionaire company without the authority’s prior approval is a termination event if it
implies a change of control. Note that, as per the second transitory provision of the ROAS, this
regulation applies to administrative procedures started after its enforcement. Indeed, there is
case law stating that the ROAS applies also to concessions granted before its enforcement.
Therefore, we cannot rule out that some City Councils in Catalonia consider that the ROAS
shall be applied also to concessions granted before its enforcement. In addition, it cannot be
ruled out that the authority considers that the ROAS subjects the indirect change of control of
the concessionaire to authorization.

Failure to comply with these requirements may lead to the termination of the concession for
which the concession will be held liable.

The current public procurement Law 9/2017 regulations on assignment essentially coincide with
the former ones. Law 9/2017 requires the possibility of assignment to be expressly established
as an option in the procurement documents. The contract cannot be assigned if the
procurement documents do not provide for it. However, the new regulation emphasizes the
regulated nature of authorizations of assignments and establishes tacit approval if the
contracting body does not rule on the assignment request within a term of two months.

**_Security over concession_**
The mortgage of a concession requires in general the prior approval by the granting authority.
This authorization will be without prejudice to the second authorization which will be required
upon enforcement of the mortgage (see Assignment section above). The contractual documents
may foresee the need to obtain the granting authority’s prior approval for the placement of
additional security relating to a concession.

In this regard, note that for example placing a pledge over the compensation or other credit
rights that the concessionaire is entitled to receive upon early termination in public works
concession awarded post-enforcement of Law 40/2015 is subject to the granting authority’s
prior approval. This provision has been upheld by Law 9/2017.

Failure to comply with these requirements may lead to the termination of the concession for
which the concession will be held liable and may imply the pledgee is not regarded as a
privileged creditor.

127


-----

**_Guarantees, insurance and other obligations with economic impact_**
Concessionaires are required to place economic guarantees before the granting authorities and
maintain them during the whole life of the concession. Note that in some cases the relevant
guarantee needs to be updated on a specific basis. These guarantees respond for the
obligations that the concessionaire has vis-`a-vis the granting authority. Although there is a
certain freedom for the concessionaire to choose how to place this guarantees, it is generally
made by means of a bank guarantee.

It is often the case that the Terms of Tender require that the concessionaire has certain
insurance policies in place during the whole duration of the concession, covering in general
third party liability and damages to the car parks. The Terms of Tender normally do not require
these insurance policies to be specific for a given car park, thus it allows that this requirement
is met through global insurance policies of the concessionaire.

Finally, it should be noted that the Terms of Tender may include the obligation for the
concessionaire to make specific investments either at the beginning or during the duration of
the concession.

Failure to comply with these requirements may lead to the termination of the concession for
which the concession will be held liable.

**_Early termination events and consequences_**
The different regulations on public contracts (1965, 1995, 2000, 2011 and 2017) provide for
certain events that may trigger the early termination of the concession contract, each of them
having particular consequences. In general, causes of termination are: (i) extinction of the legal
personality of the contracting company; (ii) declaration of insolvency in any other proceeding
of the concessionaire; (iii) mutual agreement between the administration and the
concessionaire; (iv) failure of the contractor to provide the final guarantee or the special
guarantee or complementary guarantee of the latter in time in the cases provided for under
law and the non-formalization of the contract in due time; (v) delay in the fulfillment of the
deadlines by the concessionaire; (vi) payment failure by the administration; (vii) failure to
comply with other essential contractual obligations; (viii) rescue of the concession or
suppression of the service by the Administration and (ix) those causes of termination that are
expressly established in the contract.

Traditionally, the concessionaire has the right to be compensated under law for the following:
(i) the non-amortized value of the land, premises and equipment used for the provision of the
service which revert to the administration, and (ii) the loss of value of any other investment
made in works and installations that do not revert to the administration.

If the early termination event is attributable to the concessionaire, damages and losses caused
to the administration will need to be indemnified by the concessionaire.

Additionally, in some cases in which the early termination event is attributable to the
administration, the concessionaire is also entitled to be compensated with the loss of profits
and other damages. In certain municipalities, there is the possibility of the administration
recovering the service awarded, the so-called ‘‘rescue’’ of the public service or public work by
the administration,’’ which means the unilateral declaration of the contracting body,
discretionally adopted, by which it terminates the concession, notwithstanding the good
management of the concessionaire.

128


-----

Law 40/2015 modified the effects of early termination of works and public services
management contract concessions. We may briefly recall the configuration of the effects of
termination as approved by Law 40/2015 and now upheld by Law 9/2017:

(a) When early termination occurs for reasons attributable to the contracting authority, the
concessionaire will receive the value of the investments minus their accounting
depreciation, as well as indemnification for loss and harm.

(b) When early termination occurs for reasons not attributable to the contracting authority
(including the insolvency of the concessionaire), the compensation to be received by the
concessionaire is identified with the ‘‘market valuation of the concession,’’ as determined in
a new award procedure via ascending-price auction, in which the sole award criterion is
the price.

**_Reversion and eventual exit payments_**
After conclusion of the concession contract the public service and/or the public works must
revert to the administration in an adequate state for its use and without any compensation.

According to the relevant municipal regulations on public contracts, the concession contract
shall determine the works and installations which will need to revert to the municipality by
expiration of the concessional term. The regulations on public contracts also provide that prior
to the reversion taking place, the administration will adopt the relevant measures so that the
reversion of the works and installations is carried out according to what is agreed in the
contract. This may entail the need for the concessionaire to carry out the relevant works or,
eventually, to provide the administration with an exit payment if the works and installations
are not in an adequate state for its use. In addition, some contractual arrangements may
foresee the need to make specific payments to the authority upon termination.

## Portugal

**_General_**
As in Spain, in Portugal car parks may be developed either privately or through the public
concessionary regime. Similar to Spain, car parks developed through the public concessionary
regime are located on publicly owned land and involve the exercise of administrative powers
relating to the regulation of traffic and local public highways. The legal regime governing car
parks developed through the public concessionary regime is more complex than that for
private car parks. Car parks developed through the public concessionary regime are managed
by a private party under an administrative concession or similar arrangement granted by a
public authority, and they are subject to the ongoing control of the public authorities that
grant the concession or arrangement.

Car parks that are privately developed are usually built on privately owned land and are
subject to a less complex regulatory regime than the regime applicable to car parks developed
through the public concessionary regime. The terms and conditions applicable to privately
operated car parking facilities are contractual in nature although subject to the applicable
mandatory private law provisions.

Enforceability of rights under the above mentioned agreements towards third parties may
depend on their prior registration before the competent land registry offices, notably in the
case of ownership rights, surface rights and lease agreements with a term equal to in excess of
six years. Private car park operators are generally required to obtain municipal licenses in order
to build and operate the car park and are subject to certain legislation governing the car park
industry, particularly with regard to health and safety, tariffs and consumer rights. For example,
Decree-Law 81/2006, of April 20, which regulates the use and access conditions to car parks, is
applicable to privately developed car parks.

129


-----

There is no specific legislation relating to the liability of car park operators for injury and
property damage in car parks and therefore the general liability rules of the Portuguese Civil
Code are applicable. According to these general rules, car park operators may be liable for
injury and property damage to the extent that the damage in question results from an
intentional or negligent violation of a third party right. In off-street car parks, car park
operators may also be liable for damages caused by third parties (for example theft) in cases
where the car park operator assumes an obligation to assure the safety of the vehicles parked.
However, in most cases, car park operators explicitly exclude these obligations in the terms and
conditions of use posted in the facility for damages caused by third parties to the vehicles
parked. As far as we could ascertain, there are no court decisions recognizing the validity of
this exclusion in situations where the car operator had included such exclusion in the
conditions of use posted in the facility.

The following summary covers car parks operated through the public concessionary regime and
accordingly subject to the public regulatory regime.

**_Applicable legislation_**
The construction and operation of public parking structures and on-street parking are
regulated by public laws governing the formation and performance of public contracts, by
municipal regulations and by the contractual arrangements entered between the operator and
the municipalities. The construction and operation of public parking structures and on-street
parking are regulated by public laws governing the formation and performance of public
contracts by municipal regulations and by the contractual arrangements entered between the
operator and the municipalities.

An administrative concession is used by public authorities to promote the development of
public works by private entities that will subsequently operate such public works (a ‘‘public
_works concession’’) or to contract a private entity to operate a certain public service, in_
principle, without involving any kind of construction (a ‘‘public service concession’’), although
some public service concessions may imply also some construction works as an ancillary
obligation.

A surface right is a right to build and maintain a certain construction for a specified period of
time over the property of the granting authority. Surface rights agreements entered into with
public entities for the construction of off-street parking facilities, whilst subject to the rules
applicable to the formation and performance of public contracts as referred to above, may also
be subject to private law.

The concessions for the construction and management of parking facilities and on-street
parking are currently regulated in Portugal through the Public Contracts Code, approved by
Decree-Law 18/2008, of January 29 (‘‘Public Contracts Code’’), which includes the general
provisions relating to the formation, performance and termination of concession agreements.
Prior to the Public Contracts Code, these agreements were regulated by Decree-Law 59/99, of
March 2 (which governed public works contracts), and 390/82, of September 17, (which
imposed certain rights and obligations with respect to any concessions granted by
municipalities). These prior laws still govern the concession agreements which formation
procedures were initiated before the Public Contracts Code entered into force. One of the most
relevant differences between the Public Contracts Code and the former legislation with regard
to administrative concessions is that, upon the enactment of the Public Contracts Code, the
duration of an administrative concession is no longer subject to a strict duration rule. Instead,
under the Public Contract Code, the duration of concession contracts is determined taking into
account the period required to reimburse and remunerate, under normal market conditions,
the concessionaire’s capital investment. In addition, the concessions in the public domain are
also subject to Decree-Law 280/2007, of August 7, that sets forth the legal regime applicable to
the management of public property. In some situations the public-private partnership
regulation set forth in Decree-Law 86/2003, of April 26, as amended by Decree-law 14/2006, of

130


-----

July 27, or in Decree-Law 111/2012, of April 26 (which revoked Decree-Law 86/2003, of
April 26), may apply.

Historically, the concessions’ duration limitation has caused public authorities to adopt surface
rights agreements (instead of concession agreements) in respect of off-street parking in order
to allow longer duration periods given that construction of parking facilities involves
investments that could not be reimbursed within such a short period of time. Surface rights are
not subject to a specific term limitation. According to the applicable rules, the construction and
operation of off-street parking facilities with respect to publicly owned land subject to the
public domain legal regime (the ‘‘public domain’’) should take place under concession
agreements and, conversely, the construction and operation of off-street facilities with respect
to publicly owned land not subject to the public domain legal regime (the ‘‘private domain’’)
could be made through these agreements. In order to overcome the above referenced term
limitation applicable to concessions and due to this distinction, the general practice adopted by
municipalities has been to disaffect parcels of land from the municipal public domain and
re-incorporate those parcels in the municipal private domain precisely to allow the execution of
surface rights agreements in order to take advantage of the longer term permitted under
surface rights agreements.

Currently, the award of surface rights agreements (in respect of publicly-owned properties) for
the construction of off-street parking facilities may also be subject to tender procedures
established in the Public Contracts Code (to the extent that they contain typical stipulations
and characteristics of the agreements subject to this Code) and, in addition, is subject to
Decree-Law 280/2007, of August 7, that sets forth the legal regime applicable to the
management of public property. If the tender surface right contracts qualify as administrative
contracts, then the administration contracts’ performance regime of the Public Contracts Code
will also apply. Prior to the enactment of this legislation, the execution of such surface rights
agreements was also subject to Decree-Laws 59/99, of March 2, 390/82, of September 17, and
794/76, of November 5. These prior laws still govern older surface rights agreements which
formation procedures were initiated before the Public Contracts Code was enacted.

**_Public tender process and award_**
The public authorities enter into contracts with the private parties selected through tender
processes in which the interested parties may submit their tenders. The specific conditions of
these contracts are set forth in the Terms of Tender (‘‘Caderno de Encargos’’) and in the
contract (which is based on the Terms of Tender). These conditions may differ among contracts
and establish particular features for each specific project, while using the aforementioned legal
framework as a reference. Theoretically, the granting of a surface right could be made,
according to Decree-Law 280/2007, of August 7, by direct award or through a negotiated
procedure, however, given the fact that the surface rights in question substantially contain the
typical elements of a concession, they are usually awarded through the aforementioned tender
procedures.

**_Types of contracts_**
Typically, car parks operate under one of the following three different classes of contract: (i) a
contract for concession of management of a public service without works; (ii) a contract for
concession of public works; and (iii) a surface rights agreement.

Most contracts for the operation of on-street car parks take the form of a concession for the
management of a public service without works, provided that it is not necessary to build any
relevant infrastructure for their operation.

Most of the contracts currently in force for the off-street car parks are operated under surface
rights agreements awarded by the municipalities, since, as mentioned above, prior to the Public
Contracts Code’s entry into force in 2008, concessions awarded by municipalities were limited
to a term of 20 years. Although even after the enactment of the Public Contracts Code the

131


-----

municipalities maintain the previous trend of resorting to surface rights agreements for the
off-street car parks, it is possible that in the future car parks developed through the public
concessionary regime will be more often awarded through concession contracts.

**_Term and renewal of administrative concessions and surface rights_**
Currently, the applicable legislation does not impose a specific term limit for administrative
concessions, and their duration shall be determined in the contract taking into account the
reasonable period required under normal market conditions to reimburse and remunerate the
concessionaire’s capital investment. In the absence of such contractual clause stipulating the
duration of the concession agreement, the Public Contracts Code sets forth a 30-year term.

Upon expiration of the agreement, the contract cannot be renewed without a prior public
tender procedure taking place. Nevertheless, under certain circumstances, the agreement may
be extended provided that such possibility had been contemplated by the contract. However
rights and certain preference rights for the grant of new surface rights may be deemed null
and void.

Surface rights agreements entered into in connection with publicly owned properties do not
have a statutory term limit but will have the term specified in the contract. This term is
determined in accordance with public interest criteria and taking into account the economic
balance of the service that will be operated under the agreement. The applicable legislation
does not allow the renewal of surface rights upon expiration of the contract. Surface rights
agreements normally have a long-term and, upon their expiration, a new agreement will need
to be executed following a public tender if the Public Contracts Code applies. Otherwise, a
limited, a negotiated or a direct award procedure could apply.

**_Economic-financial balance_**
In general, public contracts are executed based on the principle that the business risk is
assumed by the private entity.

Notwithstanding this, the law foresees certain situations that may lead to a modification of the
terms initially agreed in order to ensure that the public interest pursued by the contract is not
affected in the face of abnormal and unpredictable circumstances or unilateral modification of
the contract imposed on public interest grounds by the public entities. In light of the Public
Contracts Code, the concessionaire or the holder of a surface right (to the extent that such
right contains typical stipulations and characteristics of the agreements subject to the Code) is
only entitled to the re-establishment of the economic balance of the contract in the following
situations (without prejudice to specific re-establishment triggers that may be foreseen in the
relevant agreement):

(i) when the circumstances upon which the parties have grounded their decision to enter into
contract suffer an abnormal and unpredictable modification imputable to the awarding
authority acting beyond the contractual frame; or

(ii) when the agreement is modified by the public entity for public interest reasons.

According to the Public Contracts Code, the means to re-establish the financial balance may be
set out in the contracts. There are no legislative limits with respect to the mechanisms that may
be adopted, but often such mechanisms include revision of tariffs, adding parking spaces or a
provision stating that the authority and the concessionaire shall jointly seek an agreement to
re-establish the financial balance of the contract. In the absence of contractual provisions
setting out the means to re-establish the financial balance, the Public Contracts Code
(applicable to concessions and possibly to the surface rights agreements if the tender program
determines its applicability or because the contract is materially a concession contract)
stipulates that re-establishment of the balance may notably be achieved through the extension
of the contractual term, through the revision of prices or through the payment of

132


-----

compensation. Any other situation involving an abnormal and unpredictable modification of
the circumstances will trigger the right to a modification of the agreement or to receive
compensation to the private entity (without necessarily implying the re-establishment of the
initial economic balance).

The legal framework applicable to concessions and surface rights agreements prior to the entry
into force of the Public Contracts Code did not specify the rebalancing right and mechanism, at
least in such detail. However, either by appealing to general rules and principles of Law or
through the use of contractual conditions establishing the rebalance right, one could sustain
such rebalancing right in as those currently foreseen in the Public Contracts Code. Therefore
from a practical point of view, the final applicable framework may not differ substantially from
the one currently in force.

There is no specific claim procedure prescribed by law to apply for the financial rebalancing of
the contract. Under circumstances that would trigger the rebalancing mechanism, the
concessionaire or holder of the surface right shall apply to the public entity within the
contractual framework and in accordance with the general rules applicable to contracts. In
practical terms, a written notice should be sent to the public entity stating the facts underlying
the rebalancing request and the relevant legal provisions and proposing the mechanism to
restore the economic balance of the contract. Normally, this will entail a negotiation with the
awarding entity. Should the latter accept the proposed mechanism, this would typically be
formalized by means of an amendment to the agreement. In the absence of a favorable
decision or in the absence of a decision within a reasonable period of time, a judicial claim
may be filed with the administrative courts or with an arbitral (depending on the dispute
resolution mechanism foreseen in the agreement), in order to obtain a ruling on the financial
rebalancing. The duration of a judicial court procedure is difficult to determine, as it depends
on numerous factors, such as the number of appeals to be completed in order to obtain a
definitive judicial resolution (generally two appeals), or the volume of affairs affecting, in each
moment, the competent court. Currently in Portugal judicial procedures in administrative courts
may last more than three years but there is no assurance the process will be completed within
this time frame.

**_Concession tariffs and other remuneration arrangements_**
The relevant Terms of Tender and the relevant contract establish the tariff scheme to
remunerate the concessionaire/holder of the surface right.

Normally with off-street structures the concessionaire/holder of the surface rights is
remunerated based on the collection of the tariffs established in the contract, which are
reviewed periodically based on the consumer price index. In addition, a fixed price or an
annual amount may also be payable by the concessionaire/holder of the surface right to the
municipality in consideration for the concession or surface right awarded.

With respect to on-street parking, normally the concessionaire agrees to deliver to the
municipality a percentage of the tariffs collected or, in some cases, a fixed amount and, in
other cases, a combination of a fixed amount plus a percentage of the tariffs. It is customary
for the concessionaire/holder of surface right to include the tariffs in its offer to tender and
subsequently propose to the awarding authority for its approval revisions of the tariffs as
allowed by the contract.

**_Authorizations and change of control clauses_**
In some of the contractual arrangements, municipalities impose certain restrictions on the
shareholder of the concessionaire and the guarantees that such concessionaire can grant to
third parties, such as the need for prior authorization to create a mortgage over the concession
or, sometimes, change of control clauses.

133


-----

Legislation relating to these matters does not expressly require prior authorization for share
transfers of the concessionaire or changes of control in it. Nevertheless, certain specific Terms
of Tender and contracts, or their interpretation by the public authority, may require prior
consent for such transactions. However, the applicable legislation expressly requires prior
authorization for mortgages or charges over assets included in the concession or over the
surface right. The need for authorization could also result from the fact that the public tender
established prerequisites for the qualification or the evaluation of the proposals that were met
by the tenderer with recourse of the parent company’s qualifications or expertise.

**_Termination of the concession_**
Under the current regulatory regime, apart from a termination resulting from contractual
breaches, concession and surface rights agreements may be terminated by the public entity as a
result of the following: (i) at any time due on public interest grounds, provided that
appropriate compensation is paid to the concessionaire/holder of the surface rights (to be
calculated according to the contractual regime or, in the absence of contractual provisions, in
accordance with the law); (ii) unauthorized assignment or transfer of the concession or surface
right; (iii) unauthorized creation of mortgages or other charges over the concession or surface
right; and (iv) certain other events specified in the Public Contracts Code. In addition, the
public entity may be entitled to assume the management of the concession or surface right
temporarily in case of severe breach of contract, such as the failure to perform or pay amounts
due. During such period, the contract will be suspended and if the operation is not resumed,
the agreement may be terminated.

Contracts usually include provisions stipulating the formula that shall be used to calculate the
indemnity payable in event of early termination grounded on public interest. In general, the
formulae are designed to reflect an amount of indemnity calculated on the basis of the
investment that was not amortized and such formulae do not usually cover loss of profit, which
needs to be claimed on the basis of general principles under law. If the municipality and the
concessionaire cannot agree on compensation, the concessionaire may file a claim against the
municipality.

**_Liability and compensation for termination of concession contract_**
In the event of termination of the contract due to breach by the public authority, the latter
will be liable for payment of the loss and damage caused to the concessionaire/holder of the
surface right. Similarly, the termination of the contract due to intentional breach by the
concessionaire/holder of the surface right will result in such entity being liable to indemnify the
authority for the loss and damage caused. Such indemnification may be sought through the
enforcement of the security granted by the breaching party, if applicable.

# Business

## Overview

We are one of the leading concessionaires and operators of parking infrastructure in the
Iberian Peninsula, as measured by number of parking spaces and revenues. We mainly operate
underground car parks (‘‘off-street’’), as well as some parking areas on city streets (‘‘on-street’’)
under concessions and surface rights agreements from public authorities. As of September 30,
2019, our portfolio comprised 403 concession contracts in 145 municipalities under which we
manage over 436,920 parking spaces, including 33,366 resident spaces, primarily in Spain and
Portugal, and marginally in Andorra, Turkey and the UK. For the twelve months ended
September 30, 2019, our revenues were e197.3 million, our Adjusted Revenue was
e196.4 million, our Adjusted EBITDA was e90.6 million and we had an Adjusted EBITDA Margin
of 46.1%. Our operations in Spain and Portugal, respectively, represented 70.7% and 25.4% of
our Adjusted Revenue, 68.2% and 28.9% of our gross profits and 82.9% and 13.9% of our
parking spaces for the twelve months ended September 30, 2019. Our off-street concession
business and on-street concession business generated 56.5% and 35.5% of our Adjusted
Revenue, respectively, and 83.9% and 16.5% of our Adjusted EBITDA, respectively, for the
twelve months ended September 30, 2019.

We have served the Iberian market since the late 1960s. We believe this has given us a ‘‘first
mover’’ advantage, whereby we have continually secured long-term concessions and built a
portfolio of prime parking locations in Spain and Portugal, including in city centers, airports
and other high density traffic areas, such as hospitals and business districts. Due to a variety of
physical, regulatory and other constraints such as cost of space, we believe that there is limited
opportunity to develop alternative parking options in many of these prime areas, allowing us
to benefit from captive demand with limited competition. Due to an overall lack of available
land in major cities within our geographical focus, and an overall urbanization trend in the
current macroeconomic climate, we do not expect this competitive advantage to diminish in
the foreseeable future.

We generate revenues under three business lines:

- Off-street concessions. Our off-street concession business primarily comprises long-term
concessions, with contract lengths generally ranging from 20 to 50 years, granted by
municipalities to develop and operate parking facilities, primarily underground and multistory, and generated 56.5% of our Adjusted Revenue (e111.0 million) and 83.9% of our
Adjusted EBITDA (e76.0 million), and had an Adjusted EBITDA Margin of 68.5%, for the
twelve months ended September 30, 2019. Under these contracts, we are generally required
to invest in the construction of a new parking facility (a ‘‘green field’’ concession) or make an
upfront payment to the municipality for an existing parking facility (a ‘‘brown field’’
concession). We operate each parking facility on a long-term basis and generate our fees
based on tariffs charged to car park users, as set out in the relevant concession or surface
rights agreement, which typically increase each year in line with inflation. We generally
retain all fees generated from operating the relevant parking facility and are responsible for
all expenses relating to operating and maintaining the parking facility during the term of
the concession. With respect to ‘‘brown field’’ concessions, we may pay an annual concession
fee to the municipality, an upfront fee or a combination of both. In addition, we sell a
limited number of parking spaces to local residents, receiving a monthly fee for the
rendering of maintenance services, as an ancillary activity in connection with the
development of some parking facilities. As of September 30, 2019, we had 285 off-street
concession contracts (including 78 resident contracts) under which we manage approximately
120,003 parking spaces. The Weighted Average Remaining Duration of our off-street
concessions was approximately 25 years as of September 30, 2019.

135


-----

- On-street concessions. Our on-street concession business comprises concessions, with contract
lengths generally ranging from five to 20 years, granted by municipalities to manage metercontrolled on-street parking, and generated 35.5% of our Adjusted Revenue (e69.7 million)
and 16.5% of our Adjusted EBITDA (e15.0 million), and had an Adjusted EBITDA Margin of
21.5%, during the twelve months ended September 30, 2019. For these types of contracts,
we typically receive fixed fees that are inflation-indexed and which cover the yearly
amortized amount of our initial investment and operating costs and reasonable rate of
return. In a number of concessions, the contract also includes a variable incentive element
(which may be based on a percentage of the collected meter receipts, the number of parking
spaces or certain other indicators) to align the concessionaire’s objectives with optimizing
revenue collection. As of September 30, 2019, we had 114 on-street concession contracts
(including seven contracts exclusively dedicated to tow-away services) under which we
manage approximately 230,966 parking spaces. We have a long-standing presence in many
cities and a successful relationship with many municipalities which we believe provides us
with a competitive advantage in securing new off-street business. The Weighted Average
Remaining Duration of our on-street concessions was approximately five years as of
September 30, 2019.

- Off-street contract management. Our off-street contract management business involves
contracts to manage parking facilities on behalf of public authorities, primarily airports, as
well as a limited number of private entities. Our off-street contract management business
generated 8.0% of our Adjusted Revenue (e15.7 million) and did not affect our Adjusted
EBITDA in a meaningful way in the twelve months ended September 30, 2019. As of
September 30, 2019, we had four off-street management contracts. Under these contracts,
we operate and manage parking facilities with approximately 85,951 parking spaces on
behalf of third parties in exchange for a fixed fee. Although it is a relatively small part of
our overall business, our off-street contract management business line allows us to gain
expertise in managing complex operations, as well as to improve our access to municipalities
and build local market knowledge.

The following table sets out our Adjusted Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA for each of our
business lines for the twelve months ended September 30, 2019.

business line as EBITDA for the relevant business line adjusted for (i) reallocation of overhead costs and non-recurring
headquarter operating expenses, (ii) non-recurring business unit expenses (including redundancy payments and other related
personnel costs) and (iii) other ‘‘one off’’ items or non-recurring gains and losses (including gains and losses realized from the

## Strengths

We believe that we have several competitive advantages in the car park sector in Iberia,
including our long-term contract revenues, diversified business profile, assets with low demand
risk and market leadership. As a result of these strengths, together with the stable regulatory
environment and favorable industry dynamics, our business benefits from a high level of
stability and recurring cash flows.

**_Uniquely positioned for growth on the back of Iberia’s favorable macroeconomic trends_**
The macroeconomic environment in Spain and Portugal, our largest geographic markets in
terms of revenues, has continued to improve. The car park industry has recently been growing
in Iberia, mainly driven by this factor as well as urbanization and an increase in the number of
cars. The profitability of the sector is generally improving, supported by scale efficiencies, the
implementation of cost savings programs and the utilization of innovative industry technology
(including digitalization), among other factors. See ‘‘Industry.’’ We believe that we are well
positioned to benefit from the continued improvement in the economic environment in Iberia
resulting in organic growth opportunities for us. The economic growth in Iberia may also lead
to consolidation opportunities that provide room for further non-organic growth. We believe
that improvements in our business activity and revenues, along with a sustained cost-base, in
connection with such economic improvement, together with our various cost efficiency
initiatives, will have a positive effect on our EBITDA.

During the period from 2016 to 2018, we benefitted from the good macroeconomic landscape
in Iberia and were able to increase our Like-for-like revenues on a CAGR basis at a higher rate
than the CAGR of GDP in Iberia over the same period.

**_Leading car park concessionaire in Iberia benefitting from scale and high barriers to market_**
**_entry_**
We are one of the leading car park concessionaires in the Iberian parking infrastructure
concessions market both by revenue and total number of parking spaces and were the leading
car park operator in Portugal in terms of revenue, and the leading car park operator in Spain
by number of spaces, for the year ended December 31, 2018. As of September 30, 2019, we
managed 362,294 parking spaces in Spain (including 33,366 resident spaces), 60,678 in Portugal,
4,075 in Turkey, 8,500 in the UK and 1,373 in Andorra. We had approximately 25.0 million car
parking transactions in the twelve months ended September 30, 2019, based on the number of
payments made across all our car parks. Our size and growth have allowed us to achieve
significant economies of scale, and the scope of our operations, combined with the various cost
management measures we have implemented, have allowed us to maintain our Adjusted
EBITDA levels. For example, our centralized control room system controls and manages a
substantial majority of our off-street concessions business’ parking facilities from a remote
location, which has allowed us to improve our cash flow and reduce operating expenses,
headcount and personnel costs (we reduced the number of operators per car park by more
than half) without impacting our service quality and customer satisfaction levels. This is a key
driver for efficiency gains and margin improvements, particularly in the off-street segment,
allowing for more competitive pricing when bidding for new contracts and placing us in a
strong position for additional growth. In addition, our mobile maintenance personnel are
responsible for the maintenance of several car parks within a defined geographic area, which
reduces personnel expenses and standby time. This has allowed us to reallocate personnel to
perform certain functions previously outsourced, thereby reducing our reliance on third-party
service providers. Our economies of scale enable us to be a consolidation platform for smaller
Iberian parking operations, and allow us to undertake valuable new concessions and
acquisitions of smaller players. For example, when we acquired Boulevard in August 2019 we
integrated the company into our centralized control room system to reduce the number of
staff on site, ensured maintenance works were performed by dedicated local teams and
arranged for management services relating to human resources, tax or accounting, to be
conducted by centralized management teams. In addition, through our experienced
management team and our long-standing reputation in the industry, we have been able to
develop and maintain important relationships with the various municipalities with which we do
business, thereby reducing our dependence on any single local authority or region.

We believe the upfront cost and difficulty in obtaining planning permission to build new high
density car parks in city centers, together with the favorable regulatory regime that applies to
concession agreements in Spain and Portugal as discussed under ‘‘—Stable regulatory
_environment with downside protection’’ below, as well as the scale required to operate car_
parks efficiently present significant barriers to entry in the car park industry. The stringent
regulatory framework governing parking concessions in Iberia reduces the risk of new
competitors entering the market. For example, due to the terms and lengths of concession
contracts (the average weighted life for off-street concessions is approximately 25 years as of
September 30, 2019), competitors can be locked-out of the off-street concessions business for
long periods of time. In addition, our size provides us with the scale required to operate a car
park portfolio efficiently. For example, our scale enables us to share resources among our car
parks including maintenance and supervisory staff, as well as management resources in respect
of accounting, marketing, human resources, insurance and tax matters. The number of our
locations also gives us a commercial advantage as we are able to anticipate customer needs
across multiple locations. In addition, the high initial investment required to produce efficient
IT resources is beyond the reach of smaller competitors. Between January 1, 2016 and
December 31, 2018, we invested an average of e1.5 million per annum in IT resources. Unlike
smaller operators, we can price into our bids the efficiencies that we can generate through our
portfolio, and thus offer more attractive terms to municipalities. Also, as there is a lack of
available land in the major city centers of Iberia, there are limited opportunities to construct

138


-----

new car parks, and our scale provides us with numerous consolidation and expansion
opportunities, which many smaller competitors are unable to take advantage of.

**_High degree of diversification_**
Our business benefits from a portfolio which is highly diversified in terms of the following:
number of contracts, number of municipality clients and types of parking services we deliver.
We are also diversified through our three business lines, each of which has different risk
profiles and capital requirements, but with similar operational and managerial requirements.
As of September 30, 2019, we had 403 contracts, comprising 285 off-street concession contracts
(including 78 resident contracts), 114 on-street concession contracts (including seven contracts
exclusively dedicated to tow-away services) and 4 off-street management contracts. Our
off-street concession business line is further diversified in terms of location, municipality, end
user and type of contract (business district, hospitals, shopping areas and tourism). We believe
our limited reliance on any single contract is a significant factor in diversifying our source of
revenues and therefore reduces our cash flow volatility. While our ten largest off-street car
parks represented 20.2% of our total gross profit for the twelve months ended September 30,
2019, our largest car park represented less than 2.7% of our total gross profit during the same
period. We believe our diversified business portfolio differentiates us from other infrastructure
companies, who typically rely on a smaller number of larger contracts or concessions, with a
greater concentration of risk. We are highly selective as to our management contracts and we
only provide such services to the extent that they comply with certain margin and profitability
criteria.

**_Strategically located assets with attractive concessions and limited demand risk_**
We believe that our infrastructure portfolio is well invested. Our on-street concession and
off-street contract management businesses have low demand risk because we are generally
paid a fixed fee for the services we provide, regardless of occupancy of the car park. Although
our off-street concession business is subject to demand risk and fluctuations in volumes, we
believe the prime locations of our concessions will continue attracting car park users and
ensuring stable utilization levels given our car parks are located in high traffic areas at or
within close proximity to city centers. Our business was created as a result of the acquisition of
the two historical leaders in the parking concessions market in Spain and Portugal, each with
prime concessions already in place. As a result, we were able to construct car parks in strategic
locations, including Playa de la Concha in San Sebasti´an and Cam ˜oes in Lisbon, and take
advantage of the existing concessions which were located within close proximity to city centers
and in high traffic areas. Therefore, we believe that we enjoy a prime position in the relevant
local area with respect to a significant proportion of our parking facilities. Moreover, the high
density of city centers together with planning regulations make the approval process for
‘‘green field’’ concessions difficult, effectively limiting the supply of parking spaces in a given
area. Additionally, many of our concessions in strategic locations have a long remaining life,
such as Cam ˜oes, Lisbon (32 years, 340 car park spaces), Playa de la Concha, San Sebasti ´an
(39 years, 655 rotation spaces plus 619 resident spaces), Joan de Borb ´o, Barcelona (20 years,
617 rotation spaces plus 14 resident spaces), Restauradores, Lisbon (28 years, 545 car park
spaces) and Boulevard, San Sebasti´an (27 years, 381 rotation car park spaces and 630 resident
spaces), in each case as of September 30, 2019. The prime positions of our car parks and the
difficulty in building new car parks helps to reduce the demand risk in our off-street concession
business.

**_Stable regulatory environment with downside protection_**
The regulatory framework governing off-street and on-street parking concessions in Spain and
Portugal affords certain protections to the concessionaire. We and other car park
concessionaires that operate in Iberia have historically benefitted from a ‘‘rebalancing’’ clause
under the relevant concession legislation in Spain and Portugal, which may also apply to
Portuguese public surface rights agreements. Under certain circumstances, a change in the

139


-----

balance of the economic terms and conditions of the concession that is adverse to the
concessionaire will trigger a right of the concessionaire to seek compensation or a
‘‘rebalancing’’ mechanism, which typically results in either an extension of the concession
period, an increase in tariffs payable by users, or sometimes an increase in the number of
parking spaces managed by the concessionaire, depending on the circumstances. This
regulatory environment has proven to be stable and predictable since the implementation of
the concession system more than 50 years ago and in the past, we have been successful in
relying on such protective legislation to seek additional compensation. Additionally, the
municipalities granting concessions have an interest in the success of public car parks since they
are a source of income for the municipality and the operation of car parks satisfies a public
need.

**_Highly stable business with limited maintenance capital expenditure requirements_**
For the twelve months ended September 30, 2019, 83.9% of our Adjusted EBITDA was
generated by our off-street concessions business, which had a Weighted Average Remaining
Duration of approximately 25 years. Between January 1, 2016 and September 30, 2019, we
have achieved a consistently high Replacement Rate across the business of 121%, including a
Replacement Rate our off-street concessions of approximately 189%. Our off-street concessions
business also benefits from regulated tariffs linked to inflation. Accordingly, we benefit from a
high level of recurring business and long-term visibility of cash flows, and we believe the longterm nature of our portfolio is matched by few other infrastructure companies in Spain and
Portugal. The most significant contracts in the off-street portfolio are public concession
agreements, with none or limited rent payments, which is not the case of a typical lease
contract more common in other European countries.

For the twelve months ended September 30, 2019, 16.5% of our Adjusted EBITDA was
generated by our on-street concessions business. We have achieved a Replacement Rate of
approximately 73% between January 1, 2016 and September 30, 2019, with respect to our
on-street concessions business. In addition, we also won a number of our competitors’ contracts
and, in some instances, we have successfully renewed our on-street concessions business despite
our competitors submitting more competitively priced bids than us. We believe this is due to
our superior technical competence, including the implementation of state of the art revenue
collection technology, and our wealth of industry experience.

Despite the decrease in demand and volumes within our parking facilities that we experienced
during the prior economic downturn, we were able to mitigate some of the effects through
inflation-indexed price tariffs under the majority of our off-street and on-street concessions
business and off-street contract management agreements, as well as growth in our concession
portfolio and our implementation of cost management measures. The stability of our business
and the resilience of our Adjusted EBITDA during the economic downturn are illustrated in the
chart below.

-----

Our business model shares all the key features of infrastructure companies, such as long-term
cash flow visibility, resilient revenue generation, long-term concessions and a favorable and
stable regulatory environment with certain protections for the concessionaire in case of
regulatory or administrative change. However, unlike some other infrastructure companies
(including those operating toll roads), our car parks, once operational, require relatively low
levels of maintenance capital expenditure. Our limited maintenance capital expenditures are a
result of our scale and preventive maintenance measures and low operating intensity. Our
average maintenance capital expenditure during the years ended December 31, 2016 to 2018
was approximately e2.2 million per annum and mainly related to the requirements of our car
park contracts, including recurring maintenance works and repairs on our car park facilities to
ensure that they remain fully operational and compliant. As a result, we believe we are
well-positioned to benefit from returns on these investments. We expect to adjust our capital
expenditure plan to ensure that our technology systems are up-to-date with new technological
developments.

We benefit from attractive working capital dynamics with low levels of credit risk with respect
to our off-street concession business, since such revenues are collected from users when they
exit the car park. Our current business does not require significant investment in working
capital. For example, our off-street concessions business line generates negative working capital
because our revenues are generally collected when earned and our costs are paid according to
standard payment terms as agreed in each of our contracts. However, our on-street and
contract management businesses have higher working capital requirements as they are more
dependent on the payment terms from contracts with public bodies. In addition, our credit risk
with respect to our on-street concessions business is primarily with the municipalities rather
than private third parties. As a result of our low maintenance capital expenditures and working
capital requirements, we have achieved significant Free Cash Flow Conversion ratios of 63.9%
and 83.1% for the year ended December 31, 2018 and the twelve months ended September 30,
2019, respectively.

Any larger capital expenditures are primarily related to the expansion of our business,
including new acquisitions and grants of new contracts and concessions. We are constantly
securing new contracts and concessions as existing contracts and concessions expire. These are
based on our analysis of investment opportunities and are typically not linked to prior
commitments. Capital expenditures linked to the expansion of the business depend upon
specific requirements from newly awarded contracts. Additional capital expenditures may be
required in connection with the renewal of on-street contracts nearing their maturity date. Our
limited maintenance capital expenditure requirements are illustrated for the years ended
December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, by the
chart below:

(1) Maintenance capital expenditure mainly relates to car park contract maintenance requirements (mainly recurring
maintenance works and repairs on car park facilities to ensure they remain fully operational and compliant) prior to
termination of the concessions to operate such car parks but excludes the initial investment made under such contract.

(2) Renewal and growth capital expenditure relates to on-street investments which are required in concessions near to their
maturity and new contracts added to the portfolio, namely a concession acquisition or an investment made in newly awarded
contracts.

(3) M&A capital expenditure relates to new contracts added to the portfolio where we have acquired the share capital of the
company and not the asset itself.

As a result of our strong margins, low maintenance capital expenditures and working capital
requirements, we generate high Free Cash Flow Conversion as outlined below:

**_Experienced management team with strong, supportive shareholders_**
Our senior management team has significant experience and understanding of the car park
sector and has an average of 13 years of experience in the industry and 9 years of experience
with the Group. Our senior management team has consistently over performed on budget
targets, through the successful integration of our businesses and significant cost savings
achievements. This over performance can also be attributed to the senior management team’s
ability to anticipate and embrace new trends and technology in the car park sector, which has
enabled us to be a pioneer in the deployment of efficient improvement programs and
user-friendly applications, such as electronic payment devices, license plate recognition systems
and mobile applications.

In addition, our senior management team maintains strong and long-standing local
relationships with the relevant regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate.

We also continue to derive benefit from the experience and financial support of the Macquarie
Group which, through its MIRA division, is the world’s largest infrastructure manager by assets
under management (according to Infrastructure Investor 50 (November 2018)). The Macquarie
Group is a global leader in the creation and management of specialist funds which focus on
infrastructure, real estate and adjacent sectors. As of September 30, 2019, MIRA had more than
e124 billion of assets under management with over 800 employees across 38 offices. MIRA has
been investing in Europe for over 20 years with infrastructure portfolio companies located in
Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Netherlands, Italy,
Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden and the UK.

## Strategy

Our key strategies are the following:

**_Maintain focus on growing revenue and improving EBITDA and cash flows_**
We will continue to implement measures designed to increase our revenues and thus enhance
our EBITDA and cash flows. Generally, under our concession agreements, we are subject to

142


-----

limitations with respect to the maximum tariff that we can charge users of our parking
facilities. As a result, we have the flexibility to structure our pricing policy as we deem fit so
long as we do not exceed the maximum tariffs set forth in the concession agreement. Our
pricing policy varies on a case by case basis, and we may use any or all of the following pricing
mechanics in order to maximize demand and volumes: (i) season tickets, whereby we can offer
a range of different products to fit our customers’ specific needs (for example, offering specific
time slots on specific days or for specific periods of time), which can help to increase volumes
during those times of the day when rotation is less intensive, as well as have a positive impact
on our working capital as a result of receiving payments in advance, (ii) different tariff
structures, whereby tariffs will differ, for example, based on the time of day or the day of the
week, and (iii) long-dated sales, whereby we can expand our product and service offering by
developing special offers and promotions designed in partnership with third parties, such as
travel agencies in connection with holiday packages or special events.

We also seek to increase revenue and volumes within our off-street concessions business
parking facilities through increased deployment of car park signage and other forms of
advertising in city centers and other high traffic areas in which our car parks are located. In
addition, we anticipate that revenues from our large parking facilities opened in the past three
years will increase over the coming years as they are currently in the ‘‘ramp up’’ phase. Within
our on-street concession business, we seek to continue improving our revenue collection
through the implementation of best practices, such as our integrated platform for payment
(Telpark) and visual car enforcement in order to increase revenues collected for the relevant
municipality, which will thereby increase the level of variable incentive compensation we
receive under such concession. Moreover, we intend to continue to implement technological
improvements to achieve greater efficiency, which will allow us to more efficiently manage the
parking areas covered by our on-street concessions business and increase the number of
parking spaces covered per employee. For example, we plan on increasing the number of car
parks, both from our existing portfolio and new acquisitions that will be connected to our
centralized control room in order to reduce fixed costs.

**_Maintain our disciplined and high operational efficiency_**
We will continue to focus on managing our business in a cost-efficient manner by using the
latest industry technologies and improving customer service. We will also continue to work
with car manufacturers to implement new technology systems. In the past, we have invested in
and installed several user-friendly IT applications to enhance the customer experience at our
car parks including electronic payment devices such as Via Verde, license plate recognition
systems and mobile applications, such as Telpark, for both off-street and on-street car parking.
We plan to continue to improve and extend the application of our cost-effective practices, such
as monthly contract-by- contract cost base reviews, the centralization of the daily management
of our off-street concessions business car parks from a remote location, our energy efficiency
programs and our on-street efficiency programs. Furthermore, we will continue to maintain our
well invested assets in order to keep our required level of maintenance capital expenditure
low, and we plan to eliminate certain overhead costs not required for continued operations.

**_Preserve and selectively expand our high quality portfolio of long-term concessions_**
We have a diversified portfolio of concessions and contracts in prime locations and will strive
to maintain and renew these concessions and contracts in order to maintain our stable cash
flow generation. We believe our infrastructure is well-invested. Our expansionary capital
expenditure is dependent on the opportunities available to us across our diversified portfolio.
Our total expansionary capital expenditure for the period from 2016 to 2018 was e83.1 million,
representing 13.5% of our total Adjusted Revenue for the same period (e35.1 million and
17.5% for the year ended December 31, 2016, e22.8 million and 11.0% for the year ended
December 31, 2017 and e25.2 million and 12.1% for the year ended December 31, 2018). As a
result, we intend to focus our efforts on renewing our portfolio of existing concessions and

143


-----

contracts by maintaining our well invested assets in anticipation of future renewal capital
expenditure requirements and organically expanding our operations by capturing new
concessions and contracts. For example, due to our market leading position, scale and
expertise, we believe that we are well positioned to continue to grow our diversified portfolio
by renewing our existing contracts and concessions and capturing new contracts and
concessions from both existing customers seeking to award new concessions and from other
organizations looking to outsource the management of their parking facilities. For example, in
line with our historical strategy, we may acquire high quality smaller car parks in prime
locations and to incorporate them into our centralized control room, which will increase our
portfolio of assets that benefit from our mobile maintenance personnel. Due to our scale,
long-standing experience in this industry and established relationships with municipalities, we
are able to achieve significant synergies that also allow us to offer more competitive terms
than those offered by our competitors. We believe our position as one of the leading
concessionaires of off-street concessions and on-street concessions parking in Iberia, combined
with our long-standing relationships with a diverse number of local authorities and favorable
industry dynamics, including high barriers to entry, will assist us in continuing to implement
this strategy.

**_Strategic focus on off-street concessions business in Iberia_**
We will continue to focus on managing our core business segments within Iberia, principally
the off-street segment. We may opportunistically consider dispositions of non-core operations
and geographies, in order to enhance the risk profile of investment capital expenditures and
improve profitability. In addition, as part of our long-term strategy, we may consider strategic
options regarding the on-street concession business line, off-street contract management and
business outside of Iberia in order to fully focus on our off-street concession business, which
has a higher EBITDA Margin.

During the first nine months of 2019 we completed several acquisitions, such as the remaining
70% equity interest in Figueira Parques, an on-street concessionaire with eight years of
remaining life as of September 30, 2019, the Boulevard car park in San Sebasti ´an with an
average remaining life of 27 years as of September 30, 2019, and the Can Quit´eria car park in
San Cugat del Vall´es (where we already operate other assets, providing sufficient room for
yield management opportunities). On January 10, 2019, we completed the disposal of our
French business for a total consideration of e0.9 million. On September 5, 2018, we completed
the disposal of our UK business (other than our contract at Edinburgh Airport, which was
retained but which is expected to be terminated on January 31, 2020) to National Car Parks
Limited for a total consideration of e3.9 million. Both disposals demonstrate our continuing
commitment to reinforcing our portfolio of core assets in the Iberian off-street space.

We may also pursue ‘‘bolt-on’’ or strategic acquisition opportunities as and when value
accretive opportunities arise. We would expect to explore opportunities within our existing
core business and geographical footprint, being the off-street segment within the Iberia
region. We would also expect such opportunities to be capable of generating synergies with
our existing operations, growth opportunities where we can leverage our operating capabilities
and skill set, and/or achieve tax synergies, to create value.

Since September 30, 2019, we have completed three further bolt-on acquisitions, namely a
freehold car park in Almer´ıa, a 15-year agreement to operate one car park in Marbella and a
car park in the city center of Le ´on for a period of more than 50 years.

## Off-street concessions

Our off-street concession business is our largest business line, representing 83.9% of Adjusted
EBITDA for the twelve months ended as of September 30, 2019, and having a Weighted
Average Remaining Duration of approximately 25 years. This business line primarily consists of
concessions with municipalities to operate parking facilities and underground parking facilities.

144


-----

Under these contracts, we are generally required to invest in the construction of a new parking
facility (a ‘‘green field’’ concession) or make an upfront payment to the municipality for an
existing parking facility (a ‘‘brown field’’ concession). As of September 30, 2019, we had
285 off-street parking contracts (including 78 resident contracts) under this business line,
consisting of approximately 120,003 parking spaces (including 33,366 resident parking spaces),
principally in Spain and Portugal. We have a diversified client base with our ten largest car
parks representing 20.2% of our total gross profit for the twelve months ended September, 30
2019. We also have seven off-street contracts and concessions in Turkey (our total Adjusted
Revenue from Turkey was e2.6 million, or 1.3% of our total Adjusted Revenue for the twelve
months ended September 30, 2019 in respect of our off-street concession business) and
Andorra (our total adjusted revenue from Andorra was e1.2 million, or 0.6%, of our total
revenues for the twelve months ended September 30, 2019 in respect of our off-street
concession business).

Our portfolio comprises parking infrastructure located in urban areas and other areas of high
traffic density, such as hospitals, and business and administrative centers. Due to our early entry
into the Iberian car park sector, our concessions include a number of car parks with prime
locations that were originally constructed in the 1960s and 1970s. Many of these locations are
in highly transited areas that attract a large number of visitors for a variety of purposes with
limited free or paid alternative parking options. The area of competition is limited to the
perimeter around the car park thus creating a local monopoly. Demand for our off-street
parking facilities in such areas experience relatively low volatility and have remained relatively
stable even during difficult economic conditions.

Generally under off-street concessions, we design, build, finance and operate underground and
multi- story parking infrastructure facilities. These ‘‘green field’’ concessions generally require us
to invest capital to build a facility or make an upfront payment to the municipality for an
existing facility in exchange for higher potential margins and long-term concession contracts.
Under our ‘‘brown field’’ concessions, we also pay an annual concession fee to the municipality.
Under the concession (or surface rights agreements, in Portugal), we charge the end users a
tariff (or fee) for the use of the facility. The fees are charged either on a per minute basis for
short-stay tickets or on a daily, weekly, monthly, seasonal or annual basis under a subscription
arrangement. The fees paid by end users are specified under the concession (or surface rights
agreement) and generally automatically increase annually in line with inflation to the extent
such contracts were entered into prior to the Spanish De- indexation Law that entered into
force on February 5, 2017. Contracts entered into after February 5, 2017, will be subject to the
conditions set in the tender documentation and the review formulas established therein. We
generally retain all fees generated from operating our off-street parking facilities and are
responsible for all expenses relating to operating and maintaining the parking facility during
the term of the contract. Our off-street parking facilities are also subject to local taxes, for
which we are responsible. We also generate a small amount of income through some basic
amenities we provide to car park users within our parking facilities, such as vending machines
and car washes.

In general, our off-street parking facilities are operated on a 24-hour a day/seven-day a week
basis. Most of the features of the parking facilities are automated, including entry and exit
controls and ticket machines. Users can obtain information about subscriptions and tariffs
online and over the phone. The car parks are staffed and operated by our own employees. We
have introduced a centralized system to control and manage a substantial majority of our
off-street parking facilities from a remote location, which has allowed us to reduce personnel
costs by reducing headcount while maintaining our high quality of services and customer
satisfaction levels. Such efficiencies have led to significant savings in operating expenses as we
have reduced the number of operators in our pre-existing car parks by more than half, and this
same practice is being applied in all the new car parks that are entering our portfolio. In
addition, such measures have helped us to reduce our reliance on external service providers by

145


-----

enabling us to reallocate personnel to perform certain functions previously performed by third
party service providers. We are also able to realize certain economies of scale by using our
on-street concession employees in managing our off-street operations. Routine maintenance,
including painting and cleaning, and security for our off-street parking facilities are provided
by both third party contractors and our own employees. We have achieved like-for-like revenue
growth of 3.5% for the nine months ending September 30, 2019.

In Spain, contracts for the management of a public service can run for a maximum statutory
term of 50 years if they include works and 25 years if they do not include works. Contracts for
a concession of public works can run for a maximum term of 40 years, extendable in certain
circumstances for up to another six years (or 15% of the initial term), depending on the legal
regime which applies to the contract itself as stated in the Regulatory section.

In Portugal, the term of the concessions for the construction and management of parking
facilities is not currently subject to a strict limitation rule, but the duration of such contracts is
determined in line with the period required to amortize the investment and obtain
remuneration under normal market conditions. However, all concessions we currently operate
in Portugal are subject to a prior legal regime whereby the term of administrative concessions
awarded by municipalities could not exceed 20 years. Notwithstanding this, 23 of our off-street
parking facilities in Portugal are governed by surface rights agreements with longer terms, such
as our 99-year term Alexandre Herculano (Lisbon) concession. Surface rights agreements
entered into in connection with publicly owned properties do not have a statutory term, but
their term is contractually specified in accordance with public interest criteria and taking into
account the economic balance of the service that will be operated under the agreement.

The vast majority of off-street concessions in Spain and Portugal are awarded as a result of a
public bidding process conducted by the municipalities. Each municipality has authority to
determine the location and economic viability of car parks within its jurisdiction.

As municipalities generally do not want to own and operate the parking infrastructure, the
incumbent concessionaire is normally well positioned to negotiate an extension of the term of
the concession (if permitted under the contract), or to obtain the renewal of the concession by
using the information and experience it has developed to bid successfully in the new public
tender process.

In certain cases when new parking infrastructure is constructed, the municipality may require
the concessionaire to sell some parking spaces in the facility to local residents who typically pay
the concessionaire the acquisition price of the parking space in one single payment. We
recognize revenues for the sale of parking spaces at the time the parking space is sold, which
coincides with the time at which the relevant contract is signed. These spaces are usually sold
at a discount compared to the market value and allow the purchaser to use the parking space
for the remaining duration of our concession agreement. The purchaser of the parking space is
required to pay us a periodic fee for maintenance.

In addition to retaining our existing concessions once their initial term has expired, we also
seek to obtain new concessions and win renewals from our competitors. For new projects, we
engage a third party construction company under a competitive bidding process to build the
parking facility. The total expansionary capital expenditure for the period from January 1,
2016, to December 31, 2018, was e83.1 million (comprising e35.1 million for the year ended
December 31, 2016, e22.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, and e25.2 million for
the year ended December 31, 2018), as a result of the consolidation effort made during this
period, focusing on M&A activity and acquisition of long term concessions. As of September 30,
2019, we had e24.1 million in outstanding capital commitments for constructing new car parks
relating to concessions already awarded in Lisbon, which we expect to invest between 2020
and 2025.

## On-street concessions

Our on-street concession business is our second largest business line, representing 16.5% of
Adjusted EBITDA as of September 30, 2019 and having a Weighted Average Remaining
Duration of approximately five years. As of September 30, 2019, we operated 114 on-street
concessions (including seven contracts exclusively dedicated to tow-away services) consisting of
approximately 230,966 parking spaces, including in practically all major Spanish and Portuguese
cities. We have been a concessionaire in a number of cities, including Madrid, Valencia and
Porto, since the introduction of controlled on-street parking and thus have a successful
longstanding relationship with many municipalities.

Under our on-street concessions, we primarily manage on-street meter-controlled parking
spaces for municipalities. Depending on the needs of the client and the terms of the
concession, we provide a variety of additional services, which can include: collecting revenue
from meters; maintaining ticket dispensing machines; monitoring parking ordinances (including
ticketing or wheel clamping); and managing complaints and appeals. Under some of our
on-street concessions, we also provide vehicle removal services. We are not responsible for the
enforcement of fines and our remuneration is not linked to enforcement.

On-street concessions are typically awarded through public tenders. Under the terms of the
concession, we are generally required to make an initial investment which can consist of a
lump-sum payment to the municipality, and for the acquisition and installment of the on-street
parking control equipment, such as parking meters and other devices related to the monitoring
of the parking meters. In exchange, we typically receive fixed fees that are inflation-indexed
and which cover the yearly amortized amount of our initial investment and operating costs. In
a number of concessions, besides the fixed fee, the contract also includes a variable incentive
element (which may be based on a percentage of the collected meter receipts, the number of
parking spaces or certain other qualitative criteria) to align the concessionaire’s objectives with
optimizing revenue collection. We believe that there is low demand risk in most of these
contracts since the bulk of our remuneration is fixed and our base fee is typically not
dependent on the amount of money collected. Even for those on-street concessions under
which our remuneration is dependent on collected revenues, we believe our exposure to
demand risk is relatively low, as the demand for on-street spaces tends to be greater than the
limited supply of on-street parking spaces, even during periods of relatively low demand.

147


-----

Under a majority of our on-street concessions, the municipality receives the parking revenues
generated by those concessions and remits the relevant concession fee to us. As a result, we
are exposed to the credit risk of the applicable municipalities with respect to these concessions.

We operate our on-street concessions with our own employees. The operation of on-street
concessions is more labor intensive than our off-street concession operations. To efficiently
manage the area covered by our on-street concessions and to lower labor costs, we have
introduced a number of technological innovations such as electronic payments and license plate
recognition systems.

Our on-street concession contracts are usually for an initial term of approximately five to
fifteen years, and some agreements include extensions for an additional period under the same
contractual terms. Recently, municipalities have increased the duration for certain on-street
concessions put to a tender process in exchange for higher initial fee payments payable by the
concessionaire. For example, we have an on-street concession with a term of 15 years in Huesca
and another with a term of 12 years in Porto, which commenced in 2016. Upon expiration of
an on-street concession, we are usually obliged to transfer to the municipality the ownership of
the assets allocated to the operation of the concession, such as parking meters, signage,
towing equipment or other vehicles. Likewise, in connection with the transfer of a concession
at the end of its term, any of our employees assigned to that concession will be transferred to
the new operator, which will, by operation of law, be subrogated to our position as employer
in respect of such transferred employees. The same will apply when we win or acquire a
concession previously operated by one of our competitors.

Certain existing contracts have historically not been renewed if they either did not meet the
Group’s internal profitability standards or if the terms offered for such renewal were not
economically desirable. In such cases, we focus on replacing expiring contracts with new
contracts that are expected to meet our internal profitability standards and which provide an
economically desirable alternative to the existing contract that is due to expire.

The following map shows the geographical distribution of our on-street concessions:

## Off-street contract management

Our off-street contract management business is our smallest business line, and represented
8.0% of Adjusted Revenue in the twelve months ended September 30, 2019. As of
September 30, 2019, we managed over 85,951 parking spaces in Spain, mainly at airports,
including those serving Madrid and Santiago de Compostela. This business line also generates a
small amount of revenues derived from providing operational and administrative assistance to
other third parties in respect of their concessions.

Our off-street management contracts are generally for shorter terms than our concession
arrangements, generally ranging from three to ten years. Our off-street management contracts
generally generate lower Adjusted EBITDA Margins compared to our off-street concessions.
However, these contracts require minimal investment and are not subject to significant demand
risk. We manage 18 airports in Spain with AENA, the Spanish public airport operator, which is
one of our main clients in Iberia with respect to our off-street contract management business.

Under our off-street management contracts, we operate parking facilities for both public and
private clients in exchange for a fixed fee, which is generally inflation-indexed. In some limited
cases, the contracts also include a variable incentive fee element based on the amount of
revenue generated and certain other quality indicators. Thus we are not required to make an
up-front payment to manage the facilities or to make significant investments in the parking
infrastructure. We typically operate the parking facility with our own employees. We also
utilize the expertise and technology from our off-street concession operations in the
management of these contracts.

We are highly selective as to our management contracts and we only provide such services to
the extent that they comply with certain margin and profitability criteria, hence not entering
in contracts that we believe could cause a harmful position for the Group.

The legislation governing off-street and on-street concessions is not applicable to our off-street
management contracts, so there is no ability to apply for economic rebalancing in these
contracts.

## Rebalancing Provisions in Off-street and On-street Concessions

Our off-street and on-street concessions in Spain and Portugal are primarily governed by
administrative laws similar to the laws that regulate highway and road infrastructure
concessions in Spain and Portugal. These concessions typically include a rebalancing clause
which provides that, in certain cases, if the fundamental economic balance that existed when
the contract was awarded has changed to the disadvantage of the concessionaire, the
concessionaire can demand fair compensation from the public authority that granted the
concession. See ‘‘Regulation—Spain—Restoring of the economic balance’’ and ‘‘Regulation—
_Portugal—Economic-financial balance.’’_

The changes that can give rise to a claim for compensation include the adoption of
administrative measures or other non-contractual and extraordinary causes that were

149


-----

unforeseen at the time the contract was made, which affect the long-term economic benefit of
the contract in a material way to the detriment of the concessionaire. For example, a
permanent road closure that adversely impacts the flow of traffic with respect to the location
of the concession may trigger a rebalancing of the concession terms. The compensation
granted by the public authority can include, depending on the circumstances, an extension of
the concession term (subject to the maximum legal term) or an increase in the tariffs
chargeable to customers or paid by the contracting authorities (for on-street concessions, when
applicable). If applicable, the public authority may grant additional parking spaces under the
existing concession or another change of the economic terms of the concession contract
between the municipality and us. The application of the rebalancing clause is not an automatic
procedure and the compensation granted will vary on a case by case basis.

We have obtained such adjustments to our concessions and contracts on a number of occasions.
In Portugal, for example, an amendment was agreed and executed with the municipality of
Faro in relation to a concession contract for on-street parking. Under this agreement, the terms
and conditions of the initial contract were modified to compensate for the tariff modifications
imposed by the awarding entity. Other concession modifications include an extension of our
Madrid concessions and an increase in tariffs as a result of a regulatory change in 1997
requiring that concessionaires invest in order to comply with new parameters, tariff increases in
multiple locations as a result of a 2006 change in parking rate calculations from hours to
minutes, and the granting of new parking spots in Pozuelo, Majadahonda and Valladolid in
2010 following the closure of certain streets to traffic.

## New Concessions and Investments

In 2016, we commenced operations under three new concessions in Istanbul as well as the
on-street management contract in Porto. The revenue and Adjusted EBITDA generated by new
parking facilities gradually ramp up over the first three to four years after they become
operational, and then typically remain fairly stable with moderate increases due to inflation
adjustments and volume increases (largely reflecting increased demand due to increased traffic
in cities) for the remaining term of the concession.

We have a well-established and disciplined process for evaluating potential new concessions
and other investment opportunities. We maintain an investment committee comprising
members of our senior management team that reviews and evaluates all concession tenders
where we consider submitting a bid. When evaluating a potential opportunity, the committee
considers targeted investment returns, the proposed financial models, expected consumer
demand for the parking facility, potential risks and possible economies of scale with existing
concession investments. Our investment committee supervises our business development
department, which is dedicated to the preparation of studies, project design and bid
documentation for tenders for new concessions and the evaluation of potential acquisitions of
existing concessions and concession operators. Our business development department works
closely with our regional business units and finance team in the evaluation process. The
Investment Committee is chaired by the Chief Financial Officer. We believe that this dedicated
approach allows us to evaluate and respond in a timely and efficient manner to potential
business opportunities.

All projects are submitted to risk assessment by our risk department which issues a report on
every project, wherein it may ask for clarifications or changes to a proposal submitted by
business development. Financial models submitted as part of this process must follow standard
rules and formats, and all project proposals must include security margins, sensibility analyses,
benchmarking and an analysis of expected competition. The investment committee may reject,
approve or approve the project with changes. Projects with an accumulated investment of
greater than e5.0 million in value must be approved by our board of directors, but those of
less than e5.0 million may be approved by the investment committee and those below

150


-----

e250,000 may be approved by the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Approved
investments are subject to a subsequent monthly monitoring follow-up plan.

In general, the tender process for a new concession requires the preparation and submission of
three categories of documentation: documentation demonstrating that the bidder meets the
legal and technical requirements to participate in the tender; documentation outlining the
proposed economic terms of the bid, including fees payable to the public authority and the
tariffs charged to end users; and the technical specifications for the development and
operation of the parking infrastructure.

Generally, bids for off-street concessions and off-street management contracts, as well as
bilateral deals, are highly competitive, focusing primarily on price and other economic terms.
Bids for on-street concessions tend to be less competitive, as there are often a limited number
of potential operators, and they tend to focus on the technical specifications of the concession
and the demonstrated experience of the bidder. Once the term of the contract expires
(including the possible extensions, which cannot go beyond the maximum term provided by
law for such concessions), it cannot be renewed without a prior public tender process. For
off-street contract management, each entity awarding the contract may have its own awarding
process and selection criteria, but it will generally be required to follow public bidding rules.

## Joint Ventures

For some of our concessions we have entered into joint venture arrangements (including
special purpose companies and temporary consortiums) with local minority partners for the
purpose of satisfying certain specific tender requirements or to take advantage of local market
experience and knowledge. We typically do this through ‘‘ring-fenced’’ non-recourse financing
arrangements. As of September 30, 2019, we operated several majority held joint ventures, and
also held minority interests in joint ventures where the local municipality requires that it holds
a majority stake in the concessionaire.

Set forth below are certain entities in which we held an ownership interest of 50% or less as of
September 30, 2019:

## Property

We lease our main corporate offices in Madrid and Lisbon. We also lease regional offices in
Spain and maintain offices in Andorra and Turkey.

As described in ‘‘Regulation,’’ upon the expiration of the term of the concession, unless the
concession is renewed, the parking infrastructure reverts to the public authority that granted
the concession.

## Suppliers

Historically, our primary suppliers have been construction companies and contractors who build
our off-street parking facilities. We also rely on suppliers of parking meter equipment and
information technology. For parking meter equipment, we fulfill our requirements from a
limited number of international suppliers. For information technology, we purchase from a
variety of suppliers.

Additionally, we outsource part of our information technology needs and certain other limited
services, including operating shuttle buses to and from our parking lots at airports. We are not
dependent on any single supplier.

## Clients

We have two groups of clients. The first group comprises the parties with which we enter into
concessions or off-street contract management arrangements. The second group comprises the
end users or customers.

Our client base with whom we enter into on-street concessions or off-street contract
management agreements includes municipalities, semi-public entities and private companies. As
of September 30, 2019, we had 285 off-street concessions, 114 on-street concessions and 4
off-street management contracts. We manage our relationships with these clients on a
centralized, regional and local basis. In general, the same personnel that manage our contracts
on an ongoing basis are responsible for maintaining relationships with our clients. A number of
our off-street and on-street concessions are managed by personnel who have developed
long-standing relationships with the municipalities and private entities with whom we enter
into concession management agreements, resulting in market recognition, enhanced ability and
credibility to win new concessions, and a strong knowledge of our clients’ needs. For the
twelve months ended September 30, 2019, our top ten off-street contracts represented 20.2%
of total gross profit.

The following chart sets out our top ten customer contracts, which are all off-street, by gross
profit for the twelve months ended September 30, 2019:

**Twelve**

The second group of clients we have are the end users that utilize the car parks that we
operate. We are focused on providing end users with a car park service that is high quality,
easy to use, safe and efficient. We concentrate on the image of our car parks by ensuring that
our car parks are up to date, safe and convenient places for end users.

## Information Technology

We believe that automation and technology can enhance customer convenience, lower labor
costs, improve cash management and increase overall profitability. As a result, we have for
more than 15 years invested in our in-house IT platform, which monitors staff, revenues and
maintenance control. We have introduced a number of automation and technology based
services to the car park industry in recent years, including a license plate reading operation
system, and have developed a proprietary set of in-house information technology applications
to optimize the utilization of internal resources and increase the quality of the services
provided. In our off-street concessions, we have centralized management which is controlled
remotely from a single 24-hour hub. As of September 30, 2019, approximately 93% of our
relevant off-street car parks were equipped with these systems. Between January 1, 2016 and
December 31, 2018, we invested and average of e1.5 million per annum in IT resources
(comprising e1.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, e1.4 million during the year
ended December 31, 2017 and e1.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2018).

## Employees

As of September 30, 2019, we employed 2,138 individuals. As of December 31, 2018, we
employed approximately 2,175 individuals. Most of our employees in Spain are represented by
a number of different labor unions.

We believe that our relations with employees are satisfactory. We have occasionally
experienced strikes and work stoppages. However, such strikes and work stoppages have
historically not had a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of
operations.

## Insurance

We purchase comprehensive liability insurance covering certain claims that can occur at the
parking facilities that we operate. As is customary, these policies have deductibles that must be
paid before the insurance companies are required to reimburse us for costs and liabilities
relating to covered claims. We also have directors and officers insurance as well as life and
personal insurance for our employees. We believe that our insurance coverage, including the
maximum coverage amounts and terms and conditions of the insurance policies, are both
standard for our industry and appropriate. We cannot, however, guarantee that we will not
incur any losses or be the subject of claims that exceed the scope of the relevant insurance
coverage.

## Competition

We face competition from other parking operators in the bidding process for off-street and
on-street concessions and contracts. We also face this competition when our concessions and
contracts come up for renewal and when we bid on concessions of others which are coming up
for renewal. As one of the leading concessionaires of off-street and on-street parking in Iberia
and due to our long- standing relationships with a diverse number of local authorities, we
believe that we are well positioned compared to our competitors. Since the Weighted average
remaining duration of our off- street concessions and contracts was approximately 25 years as
of September 30, 2019, we face limited competition in the near future to maintain our
off-street portfolio. Generally, the competition to obtain off-street concessions is more intense
than for on-street concessions. Additionally, there are several barriers to entry to obtain new
concessions, in particular for on-street concessions. These barriers to entry include having the
relevant administrative qualifications, relevant experience and technology.

Our parking facilities face competition for end users with nearby parking options. In general,
we believe end users are not willing to park more than a short walk from their intended

153


-----

destination so competition is generally based on location and proximity to a customer’s
intended location. However, we may face competition from parking structures built nearby. We
believe this competition is normally limited since many of our off-street parking facilities have
limited direct competition within easy walking distance and the risk of new structures being
built is mitigated by the cost and difficulty of developing new parking facilities in city centers
due to the high density and planning regulations. For our on-street concessions, the terms of
the concessions provide us with exclusivity within the areas covered by the relevant concession,
subject to parking allocated to local residents.

## Legal Proceedings

We are party to various legal proceedings involving routine claims that are incidental to our
business. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risk Relating to Our Business and Industry—Instances of fraud,
_bribery and corruption involving our management, employees, business partners or agents_
_could expose us to penalties and reputational damage and could hinder our ability to acquire_
_or renew concessions or even continue our operating activities’’ and ‘‘Risk Factors—Risk_
_Relating to Our Business and Industry—We are subject to changes in tax laws, tax rates and_
_their application and interpretation in the markets in which we operate, and we have been_
_(and may continue to be) subject to significant claims related to tax disputes and audits.’’_
Although our legal and financial liability with respect to such proceedings cannot be estimated
with certainty, we do not believe that the outcome of these legal proceedings, individually or
in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or
results of operations.

_Agreement’’ and the facility thereunder the ‘‘Revolving Credit Facility’’), between, inter alios,_
Midco, the Parent Guarantor and J.P. Morgan Securities plc and Barclays Bank PLC as mandated
lead arrangers and lenders thereunder. The Revolving Credit Facility will provide for total
commitments of up to e100 million (as compared to e75.0 million under our Existing Revolving
Credit Agreement) and will mature 6.5 years after the Issue Date or, if earlier, 6 months prior
to the earliest maturity date of the Fixed Rate Notes. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit
Facility (and any letters of credit or ancillary facilities made available thereunder) must be
made in Euros and will be available to finance or refinance, among other things, the Group’s
general corporate purposes and working capital facilities (including acquisitions, capital
expenditures and fees, costs and expenses) but may not be drawn for the purposes of funding
the Redemption or paying principal or interest under any Proceeds Loan.

**_Repayments and prepayments_**
Repayments of loans drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility and related interest payments
will be due and payable at the end of the interest period for each loan. The applicable interest
period will be selected in the relevant utilization request and will either be one, two, three or
six months. There is no clean down requirement.

If it becomes unlawful in any jurisdiction for a lender to perform its obligations under the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (or it becomes unlawful for any affiliate of a lender for
that lender to do so) such lender under the Revolving Credit Facility will have the right to
cancel its commitments. Each borrower under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement shall
repay (to the extent necessary to cure the relevant illegality) the relevant lender’s participation
in any utilizations made to that borrower on the last day of the interest period after Midco has
been notified or if earlier, the date specified by the relevant lender (being no earlier than the
last day of any applicable grace period).

On a change of control or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Group (pursuant to
the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement), the lenders may request, by not less
than ten business days’ notice to Midco, cancellation of its commitments and may declare all
outstanding amounts owed to it due and payable provided that such request is made within
30 days of the occurrence of the applicable event. The Revolving Credit Facility is not portable.

Additionally, if any member of the Group repays, prepays, purchases, defeases, redeems,
acquires or retires (the ‘‘Notes Repurchase’’) any Notes and certain other replacement debt
(‘‘Notes Repurchase Debt’’) other than to the extent funded with new equity or subordinated
shareholder debt, the proceeds of any listing, any permitted refinancing or amounts which
would otherwise be permitted to be returned to investors and, as a result of such Notes
Repurchase (the ‘‘Specified Notes Repurchase’’) when taken together with any other Notes
Repurchase previously effected or which will be effected on the same date as such Specified
Notes Repurchase, the aggregate principal amount of the Notes Repurchase Debt outstanding
immediately following such Specified Notes Repurchase is not in excess of or equal to 50% of
the aggregate principal amount of the Notes Repurchase Debt as at the Issue Date (the

160


-----

‘‘Prepayment Threshold’’), commitments are required to be cancelled and outstanding loans
prepaid in an amount equal to the proportion that the amount by which the Prepayment
Threshold exceeds the principal amount of the Notes Repurchase Debt immediately following
such Specified Notes Repurchase bears to the amount of the Prepayment Threshold.

**_Interest and fees_**

Loans under the Revolving Credit Facility will bear interest at a rate equal to the aggregate of
EURIBOR (subject to a 0% floor) and a margin of 1.50% per annum.

A commitment fee is payable on the aggregate undrawn and uncanceled amount of the
Revolving Credit Facility from the Closing Date to the end of the availability period applicable
to the Revolving Credit Facility at a rate of 35% of the applicable margin per annum for the
Revolving Credit Facility.

**_Incremental facilities_**
The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will contemplate, subject to certain conditions thereof,
the incurrence of additional incremental uncommitted revolving or term facilities (‘‘Incremental
_Facilities’’) in a maximum aggregate amount not to exceed (after taking account of the_
commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility and any prior Incremental Facilities) the
amount able to be incurred under the second paragraph of the covenant described under
‘‘Description of Notes—Certain Covenants—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of
_Preferred Stock.’’ Furthermore, to the extent such Incremental Facilities are to constitute Credit_
Facilities, the maximum aggregate amount of such Incremental Facilities shall not exceed the
amount able to be incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph of the covenant
described under ‘‘Description of Notes—Certain Covenants—Incurrence of Indebtedness and
_Issuance of Preferred Stock.’’ To the extent such Incremental Facilities constitute Credit_
Facilities, they will be secured and guaranteed on a pari passu basis with the Revolving Credit
Facility and rank pari passu in right of payment and security with the Revolving Credit Facility
(including with respect to mandatory prepayments), and otherwise will be secured and
guaranteed on a pari passu basis with the Notes and rank pari passu in the right of payment
and security with the Notes.

The availability, maturity, pricing and other terms of any Incremental Facility will be those
agreed between Midco and the relevant lenders of that Incremental Facility, provided that no
secured Incremental Facility may have a maturity date that is earlier than the maturity date of
the Revolving Credit Facility.

**_Guarantees and security_**
The Revolving Credit Facility will be (subject to certain Agreed Security Principles set forth in
the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) guaranteed by the Guarantors and secured on a pari
_passu basis by the same collateral that will secure the Notes as further described in the section_
entitled ‘‘Description of Notes—Security.’’

Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, Midco will be required to ensure that on the date
(i) which is 60 days after (and excluding) the Issue Date and (ii) thereafter, within 120 days of
the test date in respect of which the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements of Midco
required to be delivered to the agent under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement
demonstrate that the guarantors represent less than 80% (calculated on an unconsolidated
basis and excluding all intra-group and certain other items and without double counting) of
the Consolidated EBITDA (calculated as if any negative EBITDA generated by a member of the
Group for such period shall be deemed to be zero) of the Group (excluding any Non-Recourse
Entities and subject to certain exceptions) (the ‘‘Guarantor Coverage Test’’), such other
subsidiaries of Midco as Midco may so elect in its sole discretion become guarantors to the
extent required to satisfy the Guarantor Coverage Test (to be calculated as if such additional
guarantors had been guarantors on such test date).

161


-----

**_Representations and warranties_**
The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will contain certain customary representations and
warranties, subject to certain customary materiality, actual knowledge and other qualifications
and exceptions, and with certain representations and warranties being repeated, including,
among others: (i) status; (ii) power and authority; (iii) binding obligations; (iv) no conflict;
(v) validity and admissibility in evidence; (vi) choice of law and enforcement; (vii) insolvency;
(vii) no filing or stamp taxes; (ix) no default; (x) accuracy of base case model and financial
statements; (xi) no litigation; (xii) compliance with laws; (xiii) pari passu ranking; (xiv) legal
ownership; (xv) holding companies activities; (xvi) COMI; and (xvii) anti-corruption and
sanctions.

**_Covenants_**
The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will contain certain of the same incurrence covenants
and related definitions (with certain adjustments) that apply to the Notes, including with
respect to restricted payments. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility also contains certain
affirmative and negative covenants. Set forth below is a brief description of such covenants, all
of which are subject to customary materiality, actual knowledge or other qualifications,
exceptions and baskets.

**_Affirmative covenants_**
The affirmative covenants will include, among others: (i) providing certain financial
information, including annual audited and quarterly financial statements and compliance
certificates; (ii) authorizations, (iii) compliance with laws; (iv) Guarantor Coverage Test;
(v) anti-corruption and sanctions; (x) further assurances and certain conditions subsequent;
(xi) no change of COMI; and (xii) Notes Purchase Condition.

**_Negative covenants_**
The negative covenants in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will be substantially the
same as the negative covenants contained in the Indenture.

**_Financial covenant_**
The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will contain a springing consolidated net leverage
covenant of 12.00:1, tested quarterly on a last-twelve month basis, if the sum of outstanding
amounts drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility (excluding any utilizations of letters of
credit, bank guarantees, ancillary facilities and amounts drawn to fund the payment of any
original issue discount and other payments, fees, costs or expenses), minus any cash and cash
equivalent investments held by the Group, exceeds 40.0% of the total commitments under the
Revolving Credit Facility and any Incremental Facilities on an applicable quarter date (adjusted
to disregard any reduction or cancellation of such total commitments at any time after the
Issue Date). The financial covenant only acts as a drawstop to new drawings under the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and, if breached, will not trigger a default or an event of
default under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. The financial covenant is also subject to
certain equity cure rights.

**_Events of default_**
The Revolving Credit Facility will provide for some of the same events of default (including in
relation to insolvency), with certain adjustments, as the Indenture. In addition, the Revolving
Credit Facility will contain certain customary events of default, the occurrence of which would
allow a majority of the lenders to cancel commitments, accelerate all outstanding loans,
accrued interest and other amounts and declare them immediately due and payable and to
enforce the lenders’ rights under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain other related
documents. These events of default will include, among other events and subject in certain
cases to materiality, grace periods, thresholds and/or other qualifications: (i) non-payment of
amounts due under the applicable finance documents; (ii) failure to satisfy certain covenants,

162


-----

undertakings and other obligations under the applicable finance documents; (iii) inaccuracy of
a representation or statement when made or deemed to be made; (iv) unlawfulness and
invalidity of any member of the Group, (v) failure of any party (other than a secured party) to
comply with its obligations under the Intercreditor Agreement (as defined below); and
(vi) repudiation or rescission of any applicable finance document or any transaction security.

**_Governing law_**
The Revolving Credit Facility will be governed by English law, with the exception that the
covenants and events of default following the equivalent covenants and events of default in
the Indenture shall be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

## Intercreditor Agreement

To establish the relative rights of certain of the Group’s creditors under the Group’s financing
arrangements, the Issuer, the Guarantors, and any obligor in respect of the Revolving Credit
Facility, any Other Credit Facility Debt, any Future Pari passu Debt and any Future Senior
Subordinated Debt (each as defined below) (collectively, the ‘‘Debtors’’), third party chargors
(collectively, the ‘‘Third Party Chargors’’), the Subsidiary Guarantors, the lenders under the
Revolving Credit Facility, National Westminster Bank plc as agent for the Revolving Credit
Facility (the ‘‘Senior Agent’’), The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch as security agent
for the Revolving Credit Facility and the Notes and certain hedging arrangements (the ‘‘Security
_Agent’’), and the Trustee, among others, will enter into an intercreditor agreement on or_
around the Issue Date (to replace an intercreditor agreement previously entered into) on
October 25, 2017 (the ‘‘Intercreditor Agreement’’), to govern the relationships and relative
priorities among: (i) the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility and any Other Credit
Facility Debt which is permitted under the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility, certain Other
Credit Facility Debt, the Notes and Future Pari passu Debt to share in the proceeds of
enforcement of Security on a super senior basis to the Notes; (ii) the holders of senior secured
notes that may be issued from time to time, including the Notes, and those party to any
indentures or other documents governing such senior secured notes; (iii) the lenders or other
creditors under any other loan, credit or debt facility, notes, indentures or other debt
instrument which are permitted under the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility, certain Other
Credit Facility Debt and the Notes to share in the Security on a pari passu basis with the Notes;
(iv) the hedge counterparties to the Group’s hedging arrangements (each a ‘‘Hedging Bank’’);
(v) the lenders or other creditors under any loan, credit or debt facility, notes, indentures or
other debt instrument which are permitted under the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility,
certain Other Credit Facility Debt and the Notes to share in the Security on a senior
subordinated basis to the Notes; and (vi) the creditors of certain subordinated shareholder debt
and certain intragroup debt. The lenders, holders, hedge counterparties and other creditors
referred to in (i) to (iv) above being the ‘‘Priority Creditors’’ and the indebtedness owing to
those Priority Creditors under the documents referred to in (i) to (iv) above, being the ‘‘Priority
_Debt’’ and the lenders, holders, hedge counterparties and other creditors referred to in (ii) to_
(v) (inclusive) (in the case of (iv), only to the extent such hedging arrangements (x) do not
constitute Super Senior Hedging Liabilities (as defined below) or, (y) following the full and final
discharge of all Super Senior Lending Liabilities (as defined below), are being taken into
account for the purpose of determining the relevant creditor instructing group (as detailed in
‘‘Security Enforcement’’ below)) being the ‘‘Senior Secured Creditors.’’

**_General_**
By accepting a Note, the holder thereof will be deemed to have agreed to, and accepted the
terms and conditions of, the Intercreditor Agreement. The following description is a summary
of certain provisions, among others, contained in the Intercreditor Agreement that relate to
the rights and obligations of the holders of the Notes and the other creditors party thereto. It
does not restate the Intercreditor Agreement in its entirety nor does it describe provisions

163


-----

relating to all classes of debt. As such, you are urged to read the Intercreditor Agreement
because it, and not the discussion that follows, defines certain rights of the holders of the
Notes and certain other creditors. In this discussion, capitalized terms have the meaning given
to them in the Intercreditor Agreement unless the contrary is otherwise stated or the context
otherwise requires.

**_Ranking and priority_**
The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Group’s liabilities under the Group’s
indebtedness shall rank in right and priority of payment in the following order:

- first, liabilities under and in respect of (i) the Revolving Credit Facility (the ‘‘RCF Liabilities’’);
(ii) any other super senior credit facility or super senior hedging (the ‘‘Other Credit Facility
_Liabilities’’ or the ‘‘Other Credit Facility Debt’’ and together with the RCF Liabilities, the_
‘‘Super Senior Lending Liabilities’’); (iii) the Group’s senior secured notes (including the Notes)
(the ‘‘Senior Secured Notes Liabilities’’ or the ‘‘Senior Secured Notes’’); (iv) any pari passu
loan, credit or debt facility, notes, indentures or other debt instrument (the ‘‘Future Pari
_passu Liabilities’’ or the ‘‘Future Pari passu Debt’’); (v) hedging arrangements (the ‘‘Hedging_
_Liabilities’’); (vi) amounts owing to the Trustee (the ‘‘Trustee Liabilities’’); and (vii) amounts_
owing to the Security Agent pari passu without any preference among them (collectively, the
‘‘Priority Liabilities’’);

- second, liabilities under and in respect of any senior subordinated loan, credit or debt facility,
notes, indentures or other debt instrument, including any guarantee provided by a member
of the Group with respect to any notes of an issuer that is not a member of the Group and
the proceeds of which are down-streamed to a member of the Group (‘‘Future Senior
_Subordinated Liabilities’’ or ‘‘Future Senior Subordinated Debt’’ and together with the Priority_
Liabilities, the ‘‘Secured Debt’’);

- third, liabilities under and in respect of certain intragroup debt (the ‘‘Intra-Group Liabilities’’);
and

- fourth, liabilities under and in respect of certain shareholder debt (the ‘‘Shareholder
_Liabilities’’)._

The Intercreditor Agreement permits any obligor party to a hedging agreement and the
relevant hedge counterparty to agree that any amount (subject to a cap) of the Hedging
Liabilities incurred under that hedging agreement will be treated on a super senior basis upon
the distribution of proceeds arising from the enforcement of any Transaction Security, as
defined below, (the ‘‘Super Senior Hedging Liabilities’’ and together with the Super Senior
Lending Liabilities, the ‘‘Super Senior Liabilities’’).

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that Transaction Security created pursuant to the
Transaction Security Documents (as defined below) will rank and secure (to the extent
Transaction Security is expressed to secure such liabilities):

- first, the Priority Liabilities pari passu and without any preference between them; and

- second, the Future Senior Subordinated Liabilities pari passu and without any preference
between them.

The Intra-Group Liabilities and the Shareholder Liabilities are and will remain unguaranteed
and unsecured.

**_Permitted payments_**
The Intercreditor Agreement provides that prior to a Secured Acceleration Event that is
continuing (as defined below), the members of the Group and Third Party Chargors, as
applicable, may make payments in relation to the Super Senior Lending Liabilities, the Senior
Secured Notes Liabilities and any Future Pari passu Liabilities, in each case in accordance with

164


-----

their respective governing documents and subject to, in the case of payments of the Senior
Secured Notes Liabilities, such payments being in accordance with the Revolving Credit Facility
and in the case of payments of Future Pari passu Liabilities, any restrictions contained in the
documents governing the Super Senior Lending Liabilities and the Senior Secured Notes
Liabilities. Following the occurrence of an acceleration event with respect to the Super Senior
Lending Liabilities, the Senior Secured Notes Liabilities or the Future Pari passu Liabilities (a
‘‘Secured Acceleration Event’’ and together with the occurrence of an acceleration event with
respect to the Future Senior Subordinated Liabilities, an ‘‘Acceleration Event’’), no Debtor, Third
Party Chargor or any member of the Group may, subject to certain exceptions, make any
payment in respect of Super Senior Lending Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes Liabilities or
Future Pari passu Liabilities except from enforcement proceeds or recoveries distributed in
accordance with the payment waterfall described in ‘‘—Application of Amounts Recovered’’
below. The restriction in the foregoing sentence shall not apply where: (a) the Majority Super
Senior Creditors and the Majority Senior Secured Creditors agree otherwise or (b) the relevant
distribution or dividend is out of any Debtor or Third Party Chargor’s unsecured assets (pro rata
to each unsecured creditor’s claim) and made by a liquidator, receiver, administrative receiver,
administrator, compulsory manager or other similar officer appointed in respect of any Debtor
or Third Party Chargor or any of its assets.

Prior to a Secured Acceleration Event members of the Group and Third Party Chargors may
make payments in respect of the Hedging Liabilities, as agreed under the governing documents
of those arrangements so long as those payments are not otherwise prohibited by the
Intercreditor Agreement. Following the occurrence of a Secured Acceleration Event no Third
Party Chargor, Debtor or any member of the Group may, subject to certain exceptions, make
any payment in respect of Hedging Liabilities except from enforcement proceeds or recoveries
distributed in accordance with the payment waterfall described in ‘‘—Application of Amounts
_Recovered’’ below. The restriction in the foregoing sentence shall not apply where: (a) the_
Majority Super Senior Creditors and the Majority Senior Secured Creditors agree otherwise or
(b) the relevant distribution or dividend is out of any Debtor or Third Party Chargor’s
unsecured assets (pro rata to each unsecured creditor’s claim) and made by a liquidator,
receiver, administrative receiver, administrator, compulsory manager or other similar officer
appointed in respect of any Debtor or Third Party Chargor or any of its assets.

Members of the Group may make payments in respect of certain Intra-Group Liabilities, as
agreed under the governing documents of the relevant Intra-Group Liabilities, so long as: (i) no
Secured Acceleration Event has occurred and is continuing and those payments are not
otherwise prohibited by the Intercreditor Agreement; or (ii) the relevant creditor instructing
group at that time (or following the discharge of all the Priority Debt, a majority of the Future
Senior Subordinated Creditors) has given written consent to the payment being made.

Members of the Group may make payments in respect of certain Shareholder Liabilities, as
agreed under the governing documents of the relevant Shareholder Liabilities, so long as:
(i) the payment is not prohibited by the terms of any document governing the Super Senior
Lending Liabilities, the Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, the Future Pari passu Liabilities or the
Future Senior Subordinated Liabilities; or (ii) the relevant creditor instructing group at that
time (or following the discharge of all the Priority Debt, a majority of the Future Senior
Subordinated Creditors) has given written consent to the payment being made.

Prior to the discharge of all Priority Debt, neither the Issuer nor any Debtor or Third Party
Chargor may make payments in respect of the Future Senior Subordinated Debt Liabilities

165


-----

without the consent of the Majority Super Senior Secured Creditors (as defined below) and
Majority Senior Secured Creditors (as defined below) except for the following:

1. if:

(a) the payment is of:

    - any of the principal or capitalized interest of the Future Senior Subordinated
Liabilities which is either (1) not prohibited from being paid by the Revolving Credit
Facility or any other super senior credit facility, the Indenture or any Future Pari passu
Debt finance document or (2) is paid on or after the final maturity of the Future
Senior Subordinated Liabilities (provided such maturity date is no earlier than that
contained in the relevant Future Senior Subordinated Debt Documents as of the first
day of incurrence of any Future Senior Subordinated Debt); or

    - any other amount which is not an amount of principal or capitalized interest and
default interest on the Future Senior Subordinated Liabilities accrued due and
payable in cash in accordance with the terms of the relevant debt documents for the
Future Senior Subordinated Debt, additional amounts payable as a result of the tax
gross up provisions relating to the Future Senior Subordinated Debt Liabilities or
amounts in respect of currency indemnities in the relevant debt documents for the
Future Senior Subordinated Debt;

(b) no notice delivered pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement blocking
payments in respect of the Future Senior Subordinated Debt Liabilities (a ‘‘Payment
_Blockage Notice’’) is outstanding; and_

(c) no payment default under the Revolving Credit Facility and no payment default of
e100,000 or more in respect of the Senior Secured Notes Liabilities or Future Pari passu
Liabilities is continuing (a ‘‘Senior Payment Default’’);

provided that no payment of principal may be made in respect of any proceeds loan
relating to any Future Senior Subordinated Liabilities pursuant to which amounts are owed
to an issuer of notes that is not a member of the Group, unless such payment is made to
facilitate the making of a payment by such notes issuer of an amount of such notes that
was previously down-streamed to a member of the Group, or

2. costs, commissions, taxes, consent fees and expenses incurred in respect of (or reasonably
incidental to) the Future Senior Subordinated Debt documents (including in relation to any
reporting or listing requirements under the Future Senior Subordinated debt documents);

3. costs, commissions, taxes, premiums and any expenses incurred in respect of (or reasonably
incidental to) any refinancing of the Future Senior Subordinated Debt in compliance with the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Revolving Credit Facility, the Indenture and any Future Pari passu
Debt document;

4. in respect of any Future Senior Subordinated Debt issued in the form of notes, certain
customary costs and expenses payable to the Future Senior Subordinated Debt Representative;
or

5. Trustee Liabilities.

Prior to the discharge of all the Priority Debt, if a Senior Payment Default has occurred and is
continuing, all payments in respect of the Future Senior Subordinated Debt Liabilities (other
than certain very limited exceptions) are suspended.

Prior to the discharge of all the Priority Debt, if an event of default (other than a Senior
Payment Default) under the finance documents in respect of the Priority Debt (a ‘‘Senior
_Default’’) has occurred and is continuing and the Future Senior Subordinated Debt_

166


-----

Representative (as defined below) has received a Payment Blockage Notice from the Senior
Agent, the Trustee or the representative of the Future Pari passu Debt representing Future Pari
_passu Debt (as the case may be) (the ‘‘Relevant Representative’’) confirming that it is a Senior_
Default and specifying the relevant Senior Default; all payments in respect of the Future Senior
Subordinated Liabilities (other than those consented to by the Majority Super Senior Creditors
(as defined below) and Majority Senior Secured Creditors (as defined below) and certain
specified exceptions) are suspended until the earliest of:

(i) the date on which there is a waiver, remedy or cure of such Senior Default in accordance
with the relevant finance documents;

(ii) the date on which a default under the Future Senior Subordinated Debt occurs for failure
to pay principal at the original scheduled maturity of the Future Senior Subordinated Debt;

(iii) the first business day 179 days after the receipt by the Future Senior Subordinated Debt
Representative of the Payment Blockage Notice;

(iv) the repayment and discharge of all obligations in respect of the Priority Debt;

(v) the date on which the Relevant Representative which issued the Payment Blockage Notice
(and, if at such time an event of default is continuing in relation to the Priority Debt (other
than the debt in respect of which the notice was given), the Relevant Representative(s) in
respect of that other debt) notify/ies the Future Senior Subordinated Debt Representative that
the Payment Blockage Notice is cancelled;

(vi) the date on which the Security Agent or Future Senior Subordinated Debt Representative
takes any Enforcement Action against a member of the Group which it is permitted to take in
accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement;

(vii) the date on which the relevant event of default is no longer continuing and if the Priority
Debt has been accelerated such acceleration has been rescinded (and if such acceleration
consisted solely of declaring the relevant debt payable on demand such rescission can be
effected by the relevant majority creditors in respect of the relevant debt); or

(viii) if a Standstill Period (as defined below) is in effect at any time after delivery of a
Payment Blockage Notice, the date on which the Standstill Period expires.

No Payment Blockage Notice may be served by a Relevant Representative unless 365 days have
elapsed since the immediately prior Payment Blockage Notice. No Payment Blockage Notice
may be served in respect of a Senior Default more than 60 days after the date that the
Relevant Representative received notice of that Senior Default.

If a Payment Blockage Notice ceases to be outstanding or the relevant Senior Default or Senior
Payment Default has ceased to be continuing (by being waived by the relevant creditors/
creditor’s representative or remedied) the relevant Debtor or Third Party Chargor may then
make those payments it would have otherwise been entitled to pay under the Future Senior
Subordinated Debt and if it does so promptly any event of default under the Future Senior
Subordinated Debt caused by such delayed payment shall be waived and any notice
commencing a Standstill Period which may have been issued as a result of such non-payment
shall be waived. A Senior Payment Default is remedied by the payment of all amounts then
due.

Following the discharge of all the Priority Debt, payments in respect of Future Senior
Subordinated Liabilities may be made in accordance with their terms.

167


-----

**_Hedging_**
Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, persons entering into any hedging transaction with
certain members of the Group will be entitled to share in the Transaction Security provided
that they are have acceded to the Intercreditor Agreement as a hedge counterparty.

**_Non-security enforcement_**
No creditor of Shareholder Liabilities shall take any enforcement action until after the date on
which all Priority Liabilities and Future Senior Subordinated Liabilities have been fully
discharged and there is no obligation to provide further financial accommodation to any
Debtor (the ‘‘Final Discharge Date’’) unless it is following the occurrence of an insolvency event
in relation to any Debtor or a Third Party Chargor and such enforcement action is permitted by
the Intercreditor Agreement.

No creditor of Intra-Group Liabilities shall take any enforcement action (other than rights of set
off to enable permitted intra-group payments) prior to the Final Discharge Date unless it is
following the occurrence of an insolvency event in relation to any Debtor or Third Party
Chargor and such enforcement action is permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement.

With respect to Hedging Liabilities, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that a hedge
counterparty may, to the extent is able to under the relevant hedging agreement, terminate,
reduce or close-out hedging prior to its stated maturity if any of the following has occurred:
(i) any of the Secured Debt (other than the Hedging Liabilities and the Trustee Liabilities) has
been accelerated or the Transaction Security has been enforced; (ii) an illegality, tax event, tax
event upon merger or force majeure event; (iii) occurrence of an insolvency event that is
continuing in relation to any Debtor or Third Party Chargor that is party to a hedging
agreement; (iv) a certain majority of other creditors of the Priority Liabilities (other than the
Hedging Liabilities) give their prior written consent; (v) if the hedge counterparty and the
relevant Debtor agree and no default is continuing under any document governing the
Secured Debt (other than the Hedging Liabilities); (vi) there is an interest rate or exchange rate
hedge excess; (vii) if the hedge counterparties cease to be secured under the Transaction
Security without their consent; or (viii) a payment default has been continuing under the
relevant hedging agreement for more than 14 days.

**_Security enforcement_**
The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the
Transaction Security unless the Security Agent receives enforcement instructions from the
relevant creditor instructing group. Any instructions provided by a relevant creditor instructing
group must be in accordance with the security enforcement principles provided in the
Intercreditor Agreement.

Instructions in relation to the enforcement of the Transaction Security may be delivered to the
Security Agent by any of (i) the creditors representing in aggregate more than 50% of the
aggregate super senior credit participations of the creditors of the Super Senior Liabilities (the
‘‘Majority Super Senior Creditors’’), or (ii) the creditors representing more than 50% of (A) the
aggregate senior secured credit participations of the creditors of the Senior Secured Notes
Liabilities and the Future Pari passu Liabilities and (B) the aggregate senior secured credit
participations of the creditors of the Hedging Liabilities that are not Super Senior Hedging
Liabilities (the ‘‘Majority Senior Secured Creditors’’). If the Majority Super Senior Creditors or
the Majority Senior Secured Creditors wish to instruct the Security Agent to commence
enforcement of any Transaction Security, the creditor representative(s) (each a ‘‘Creditor
_Representative’’) of the relevant creditor instructing group shall notify the Security Agent and_
the creditor representative of each other creditor of the Priority Liabilities.

168


-----

Following delivery of proposed enforcement instructions, the Creditor Representatives of the
Majority Super Senior Creditors and the Majority Senior Secured Creditors will consult with
each other in good faith as to the manner of enforcement for a period of five business days
with a view to coordinating the instructions to be given by the relevant creditor instructing
group and agreeing the strategy for enforcement unless: (i) the Majority Super Senior Creditors
and the Majority Senior Secured Creditors otherwise agree; (ii) an insolvency event has
occurred in relation to any Third Party Chargor, Debtor or other member of the Group and the
Transaction Security has become enforceable as a result; (iii) the Majority Super Senior Creditors
or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors determine in good faith that no consultation period
or, as the case may be, a shorter consultation period is necessary in order to avoid (a) impairing
the value which would be realized on enforcement of the Transaction Security to an extent
that would prevent the discharge of the Super Senior Liabilities in full, or (b) having a material
adverse effect on the Security Agent’s ability to enforce the Transaction Security (the
‘‘Consultation Period’’). In circumstances where (iii)(a) above applies, any instructions delivered
by a Creditor Representative must be limited to those necessary to protect or preserve the
interests of the relevant creditor instructing group on behalf of which it acts as a Creditor
Representative and the Security Agent will act in accordance with the instructions first
received.

After the expiry of the Consultation Period:

- If the Majority Super Senior Creditors and/or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors have
agreed on an enforcement strategy, the Security Agent shall be instructed to implement the
same.

- If the Security Agent has received conflicting security enforcement instructions, the Security
Agent, subject to certain exceptions, will act on the instructions of the Majority Senior
Secured Creditors provided that those instructions are in accordance with the security
enforcement principles.

- If the Security Agent is required to act on the instructions of the Majority Senior Secured
Creditors and Majority Super Senior Creditors and either (i) enforcement has not commenced
within three months of the end of the Consultation Period; (ii) the Super Senior Liabilities
have not been irrevocably repaid in full in cash within six months of the end of the
Consultation Period; or (iii) at any time (whether before or after the expiry of the
Consultation Period) an insolvency event has occurred in relation to any Third Party Chargor,
Debtor or other member of the Group and the Security Agent has not commenced
enforcement of the Transaction Security, then the Security Agent shall act on the
enforcement instructions of the Majority Super Senior Creditors provided that such
instructions are consistent with the security enforcement principles.

If the Majority Super Senior Creditors or Majority Senior Secured Creditors (acting reasonably)
consider at any time that the Security Agent is enforcing the Transaction Security in a manner
which is not consistent with the security enforcement principles, the Creditor Representatives of
the other Super Senior Creditors and Senior Secured Creditors shall consult with the Security
Agent for a period of ten days (or such lesser period as the relevant Creditor Representatives
may agree) with a view to agreeing the manner of enforcement, provided that the Creditor
Representatives are not obliged to consult in this circumstance more than once in relation to
each enforcement.

_Restrictions on enforcement by the future senior subordinated debt; standstill_
Prior to the discharge of all the Priority Debt, neither the creditors of any Future Senior
Subordinated Debt (the ‘‘Future Senior Subordinated Creditors’’) nor the creditor representative
of the Future Senior Subordinated Creditors (the ‘‘Future Senior Subordinated Debt
_Representative’’) may take enforcement action with respect to the Future Senior Subordinated_
Debt (including any action against the Issuer or the guarantors of the Future Senior

169


-----

Subordinated Debt (if any)) or direct the Security Agent to enforce or otherwise require the
enforcement of any relevant Transaction Security document without the prior consent of or as
required by the relevant creditor instructing group (as detailed in ‘‘—Security enforcement’’
above), except if (1) an event of default has occurred under the Future Senior Subordinated
Debt resulting from failure to pay principal at its original scheduled maturity or (2):

(a) an event of default under the debt documents for the Future Senior Subordinated Debt is
continuing;

(b) the Senior Agent, the Trustee and the other representatives of the Priority Debt have
received notice of the specified event of default from the Future Senior Subordinated Debt
Representative;

(c) a Standstill Period (as defined below) has expired; and

(d) the relevant event of default is continuing at the end of the Standstill Period,

provided that in the case of (2) only, no such action may be taken if the Security Agent is
acting in accordance with the instructions of the relevant creditor instructing group (as
detailed in ‘‘—Security enforcement’’ above) to take steps for enforcement and such action
might be reasonably likely adversely affect such enforcement.

A ‘‘Standstill Period’’ shall mean the period starting on the date that the Future Senior
Subordinated Debt Representative serves an enforcement notice on the Senior Agent, the
Trustee and the representative of any Future Pari passu Debt until the earliest of:

(a) the first business day 179 days after such date;

(b) the date on which the Security Agent takes enforcement action (including the enforcement
of any Transaction Security permitted to be enforced under the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement), provided that the Future Senior Subordinated Debt Representative and
holders of Future Senior Subordinated Debt may only take the same enforcement action
against the same entity as is taken by the Security Agent and may not take any other
action against any other member of the Group or Third Party Chargor;

(c) the date on which an insolvency event occurs in respect of any Debtor or Third Party
Chargor owing Future Senior Subordinated Liabilities against whom enforcement action is
to be taken (other than as a result of any action taken by a Future Senior Subordinated
Creditor);

(d) the date on which a default under the Future Senior Subordinated Debt occurs for failure
to pay principal at the original scheduled maturity of the Future Senior Subordinated Debt;
and

(e) the expiration of any other Standstill Period which was outstanding at the date that the
current Standstill Period commenced (other than as a result of a cure, waiver or permitted
remedy thereof).

If an Event of Default ceases to be continuing then (provided the relevant parties are made
aware of such fact) any relevant enforcement process (including any requirement of
consultation relating to enforcement) relying solely on that Event of Default shall cease to
continue.

**_Security enforcement principles_**

- The Intercreditor Agreement includes security enforcement principles with the aim of
maximizing, so far as is consistent with prompt and expeditious realization of value from
enforcement of the Transaction Security, the recovery by the creditors of the Priority
Liabilities and (to the extent the Transaction Security is expressed to secure the same) the
Future Senior Subordinated Liabilities (the ‘‘Security Enforcement Objective’’).

170


-----

- The Transaction Security will be enforced and other action as to enforcement will be taken
such that either:

    - to the extent the instructing group is the Majority Super Senior Creditors, all
proceeds of enforcement are received by the Security Agent in cash or cash
equivalent investments (or substantially all in cash or cash investments); or

    - to the extent the instructing group is the Majority Super Senior Creditors, either
sufficient proceeds from enforcement will be received by the Security Agent in cash
or cash equivalent investments to ensure that when the proceeds are applied in
accordance with the order of application set forth below under ‘‘—Application of
_amounts recovered,’’ the Super Senior Liabilities are repaid and discharged in full_
(unless the Majority Super Senior Creditors agree otherwise).

- Enforcement must be prompt and expeditious and, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement, the time frame for the realization of value from the enforcement of the
Transaction Security will be determined by the relevant creditor instructing group provided
that it is consistent with the Security Enforcement Objective.

Where proposed enforcement of Transaction Security is over (i) assets (other than shares in a
member of the Group) with an aggregate book value exceeding e5 million (or its equivalent),
or (ii) some or all of the shares in a member of the Group over which Transaction Security
exists,

- the Security Agent shall if instructed by the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority
Senior Secured Creditors obtain an opinion from a reputable internationally- recognized
(a) investment bank, (b) accounting firm or (c) other third party professional firm which is
regularly engaged in providing valuations of businesses or assets similar or comparable to
those charged under the Transaction Security to be enforced to opine as expert: (1) on the
optimal method of enforcing the Transaction Security so as to achieve the Security
Enforcement Objective and maximize the recovery of any such enforcement; (2) that the
proceeds received from any such enforcement represent fair value from a financial point of
view after taking into account all relevant circumstances; and (3) that such sale is otherwise
in accordance with the Security Enforcement Objective. Such opinion save as to manifest
error will be conclusive evidence that the Security Enforcement Objective has been met. If
enforcement is conducted by way of a public auction, no financial adviser shall be required
to be appointed.

The Security Enforcement Principals may be amended, varied or waived with the prior written
consent of the Majority Super Senior Creditors, the Majority Senior Secured Creditors and the
Security Agent.

**_Turnover_**
The Intercreditor Agreement provides that if any Primary Creditor (as defined below) receives
or recovers or otherwise realizes the proceeds of any enforcement of any Transaction Security
or any other amounts which should otherwise be received, recovered or realized by the
Security Agent pursuant to the payment waterfall described in ‘‘—Application of amounts
_recovered’’ below and in addition if any creditor of Future Senior Subordinated Debt receives_
or recovers any payment or distribution not permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement or
applied other than in accordance with the ‘‘—Application of amounts recovered’’ described
below that it shall (subject to certain prior actual knowledge qualifications in the case of the
notes trustees):

- in relation to receipts or recoveries not received or recovered by way of set-off, (i) hold that
amount on trust for the Security Agent and separate from other assets, property or funds
and promptly pay that amount to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; and (ii) promptly pay an amount equal to the amount

171


-----

(if any) by which receipt or recovery exceeds the relevant liabilities owed to such creditor to
the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement; and

- in relation to receipts and recoveries received or recovered by way of set-off, promptly pay
an amount equal to that recovery to the Security Agent for application in accordance with
the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Application of amounts recovered_**
Subject to the rights of creditors mandatorily preferred by law applying to companies
generally, proceeds of enforcement, all recoveries by the Security Agent or all other amounts
paid to the Security Agent pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement shall be applied in the
following order of application:

- first, in or towards payment of (i) pari passu and pro rata any sum owing to the Security
Agent, any receiver, any delegate and the Trustee and then (ii) pari passu and pro rata any
costs and expenses owing to each Creditor Representative (other than a Creditor
Representative that is a Hedging Bank) and any receiver, attorney or agent appointed by
such Creditor Representative, as between themselves;

- second, pari passu and pro rata as between themselves in or towards payment of all costs
and expenses incurred by or on behalf of creditors of the Super Senior Liabilities or the
Senior Secured Notes Liabilities in connection with the realization or enforcement of the
Transaction Security or any action taken at the request of the Security Agent;

- third, pari passu and pro rata as between themselves in or towards payment of the Super
Senior Liabilities;

- fourth, pari passu and pro rata as between themselves in or towards payment of all costs
and expenses incurred by or on behalf of creditors of the Senior Secured Notes Liabilities and
the Future Pari passu Liabilities in connection with the realization or enforcement of the
Transaction Security or any action taken at the request of the Security Agent;

- fifth, pari passu and pro rata as between themselves in or towards payment of the Senior
Secured Notes Liabilities, the Future Pari passu Liabilities and any Hedging Liabilities that are
not Super Senior Hedging Liabilities;

- sixth, pari passu and pro rata as between themselves in or towards payment of all costs and
expenses incurred by or on behalf of creditors of the Future Senior Subordinated Liabilities in
connection with the realization or enforcement of the Transaction Security or any action
taken at the request of the Security Agent;

- seventh, pari passu and pro rata as between themselves in or towards payment of the Future
Senior Subordinated Liabilities; and

- eighth, after the Final Discharge Date, in payment of the surplus (if any) to the relevant
Debtor, Third Party Chargor or other person entitled to it.

**_Non-distressed disposal_**
In circumstances where a disposal or certain other specified transactions are not being effected
pursuant to a Distress Event (as defined below) (a disposal effected pursuant to a Distress Event
being a ‘‘Distressed Disposal’’) and are otherwise permitted by the terms of the Indenture and
the debt documents for the Future Pari passu Debt and the Future Senior Subordinated Debt
and the finance documents for the Revolving Credit Facility and any Other Credit Facility Debt,
the Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent is authorized and instructed (i) to
release the Transaction Security or any other claim in respect of the liabilities secured by the
Transaction Security; (ii) if the relevant asset consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor, to
release the Transaction Security or any other claim in respect of the liabilities secured by the

172


-----

Transaction Security over the assets of that Debtor and the shares in and assets of any of its
subsidiaries and (iii) execute and deliver or enter into any release of the Transaction Security or
any claim described in paragraphs (i) and (ii) and issue any certificates of non-crystallization of
any floating charge or any consent to dealing that may, in the discretion of the Security Agent,
be considered necessary or desirable.

**_Distressed disposal_**
Where a Distressed Disposal of an asset is being effected, the Intercreditor Agreement provides
that the Security Agent is authorized: (i) to release the Transaction Security, or any other claim
over that asset; (ii) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor
or Third Party Chargor, to release (a) that Debtor, Third Party Chargor and any subsidiary of
that Debtor or Third Party Chargor (as applicable) from all or any part of its liabilities to the
Priority Creditors or Future Senior Subordinated Creditors or others or otherwise in connection
with the Notes (‘‘Primary Liabilities’’) or other liabilities it may have to a creditor of Shareholder
Liabilities (a ‘‘Shareholder Lender’’), a creditor of Intra-Group Liabilities (an ‘‘Intra-group
_Lender’’) or other Debtors and Third Party Chargors; (b) any Transaction Security granted by_
that Debtor, Third Party Chargor or any subsidiary of that Debtor or Third Party Chargor over
any of its assets; and (c) any other claim of a Shareholder Lender, Intragroup Lender, or
another Debtor or Third Party Chargor over that Debtor’s assets or over the assets of any
subsidiary of that Debtor or Third Party Chargor; (iii) if the asset which is disposed of consists
of shares in the capital of any holding company of a Debtor or Third Party Chargor, to release
(a) that holding company and any subsidiary of that holding company from all or any part of
its Primary Liabilities and Other Liabilities; (b) any Transaction Security granted by any
subsidiary of that holding company over any of its assets; and (c) any other claim of a
Shareholder Lender, Intragroup Lender or another Debtor over the assets of any subsidiary of
that holding company; and (iv) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital
of a Debtor or Third Party Chargor or a holding company of a Debtor or Third Party Chargor,
to provide, for (1) the transfer of liabilities to another Debtor or Third Party Chargor and/or
(2) at the discretion of the Security Agent (provided that it is acting in accordance with the
Security Enforcement Principles) the disposal, to third parties, of creditor’s claims against that
Debtor or Third Party Chargor or holding company (which may include claims against the
Issuer).

Where borrowing liabilities in respect of any Priority Debt would otherwise be released
pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (including as stated above), the primary
creditor concerned may elect to have those borrowing liabilities transferred to Midco (or its
immediate holding company after the relevant Distressed Disposal), in which case the Security
Agent will be irrevocably authorized (at the cost of the relevant Debtor or Midco (or its
immediate holding company after the relevant Distressed Disposal) and without any consent,
sanction, authority or further confirmation from any creditor under the Intercreditor
Agreement, Debtor or Third Party Chargor to execute such documents as are required to so
transfer those borrowing liabilities.

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected such that the claims of the holders of the Future
Senior Subordinated Debt against the Issuer, any guarantees in respect of the Future Senior
Subordinated Debt and/or Transaction Security securing the Future Senior Subordinated Debt
will be released, it is a condition to the release that either:

(i) the Future Senior Subordinated Debt Representative has approved the release on the
instructions of the Future Senior Subordinated Debt Required Holders (as defined below);
or

(ii) each of the following conditions are satisfied:

(a) the proceeds of such sale or disposal are in cash or cash equivalent investments (or
substantially in cash or cash equivalent investments);

173


-----

(b) all present or future obligations owed to the secured parties under the Priority Debt
documents by a member of the Group all of whose shares pledged under the
Transaction Security are sold or disposed of pursuant to such enforcement action, are
unconditionally released and discharged or sold or disposed of concurrently with such
sale (and such obligations are not assumed by the purchaser or one of its affiliates),
and all Transaction Security in respect of the assets that are sold or disposed of is
simultaneously and unconditionally released concurrently with such sale; and

(c) such sale or disposal (including any sale or disposal of any claim) is made:

(1) pursuant to a public auction in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement; or

(2) where an internationally recognized investment bank or an internationally
recognized firm of accountants selected by the Security Agent has delivered an
opinion in respect of such sale or disposal that the amount received in connection
therewith is fair from a financial point of view taking into account all relevant
circumstances (although there shall be no obligation to postpone any such sale,
disposal or transfer in order to achieve a higher price) including the method of
enforcement and the circumstances giving rise to such sale, provided that the
liability of such investment bank or internationally recognized firm of accountants
in giving such opinion may be limited to the amount of its fees in respect of such
engagement.

**_Application of proceeds of a distressed disposal_**
The net proceeds of a Distressed Disposal (and the net proceeds of any disposal of liabilities)
shall be paid to the Security Agent (as the case may be) for application in accordance with the
provisions set forth under ‘‘—Application of amounts recovered’’ above as if those proceeds
were the proceeds of an enforcement of the Transaction Security and, to the extent that any
disposal of liabilities has occurred, as if the disposal of liabilities had not occurred.

**_Option to purchase_**
Following:

(a) an Acceleration Event; or

(b) the enforcement of any Transaction Security, (each, ‘‘Distress Event’’),

the holders of the Senior Secured Notes and Future Pari passu Debt shall have an option to
purchase all (but not part) of the commitments of the Lenders under the Revolving Credit
Facility (or their affiliates) and all exposures of the Hedging Banks in respect of any Hedging
Agreement at par plus accrued interest and all other amounts owing under the Revolving
Credit Facility and Hedging Agreements, with such purchase to occur all at the same time.

Following a Distress Event, the holders of the Future Senior Subordinated Debt shall have an
option to purchase all (but not part) of the Priority Debt at par plus accrued interest and all
other amounts owing in respect of such Priority Debt, with such purchase to occur all at the
same time.

**_Voting and amendments_**

_passu Debt will be in accordance with the relevant documents._

Except (i) for amendments of a minor, technical or administrative nature which may be effected
by the Security Agent (ii) amendments and waivers to the security enforcement principles,
which may be effected as described above in ‘‘—Security enforcement principles’’ and subject to

174

Future Senior Subordinated Debt to the extent that it would result in them being inconsistent
with the agreed major terms for such Future Senior Subordinated Debt.

## Project Finance Facilities

A number of our non-wholly owned subsidiaries have entered into certain financing
arrangements with banks in order to finance the construction of parking infrastructure under
our concession contracts. These financing arrangements are non-recourse project financing
arrangements, in which the lenders only have recourse against the subsidiary that is the
borrower under the arrangement (and its assets and, in some cases, its capital stock), and not
to other members of the Group. As of September 30, 2019, after giving pro forma effect to the
issuance of the Notes and the Redemption, we had e53.6 million of indebtedness (excluding
accrued interest and amortization costs of e0.6 million) outstanding under our Project Finance
Facilities.

Set forth below is a summary of the key Project Finance Facilities that we expect to remain
outstanding on the Issue Date.

- Construction of Oquendo (San Sebastian). During 2006, Guipuzcoa Parking Siglo XXI S.A.,
which is 60% owned by our wholly-owned subsidiary Estacionamientos Guipuzcoanos, S.L.U.,
entered into a loan agreement with the Spanish bank Caja de Ahorros y Monte de Piedad de
Guipuzcoa y San Sebastian—Guipuzkoa Eta Donostiako Aurrezki Kutxa. The original amount
of the loan extended under this agreement was e33.3 million. The amortization payments
under the loan commenced in 2008, and the loan has a final maturity in December 2035. The
loan is secured by a mortgage over the concession to expand and operate the off-street

176


-----

parking facility Oquendo (San Sebastian) held by the borrower. As of September 30, 2019,
the total outstanding amount under the loan was e23.8 million and the interest rate was
three-month EURIBOR plus 0.65%.

- Construction of La Concha (San Sebastian). During 2009, Concha Parking, S.A, which is 60%
owned by Estacionamientos Guipuzcoanos, S.L.U., our wholly owned subsidiary, entered into
a loan facility with a group of Spanish banks. The original amount of this loan was
e31.1 million. The amortization payments under the loan commenced in January 2012, and
the loan has a final maturity in August 2029. This loan is secured by a mortgage over the
concession to operate an off-street parking facility in San Sebastian. As of September 30,
2019, the total outstanding amount under the loan was e20.1 million and the interest rate
was three-month EURIBOR plus 2.5%.

This loan agreement imposes restrictions on the ability of the borrower to make distributions
to its shareholders. Distributions are permitted only in the form of dividends against the net
profit of the borrower for the prior fiscal year and the borrower may not make any
distributions prior to making 24 amortization payments under the credit facility. As a result,
no distributions were permitted to be paid prior to January 2018. Other forms of
remuneration, such as the payment of management fees, are also not permitted under the
terms of the facility.

- Construction of Plaza de Catalu ˜na (San Sebastian). During 2010 Aparcamientos Gipuzcoanos,
S.L, which is 60% owned by our wholly-owned subsidiary Estacionamientos Gipuzcoanos,
S.L.U. entered into a loan agreement with a group of Spanish banks. The original amount of
this loan facility was e12.2 million. The amortization payments under the loan commenced in
January 2012 and the loan has a final maturity in October 2029. The loan is secured by a
mortgage over the concession to operate an off-street parking concession, Plaza de Catalu ˜na,
in San Sebastian. As of September 30, 2019, the total outstanding amount under the loan
was e9.7 million and the interest rate was three-month EURIBOR plus 2.75%.

The loan agreement imposes restrictions on the ability of the borrower to make distributions
to its shareholders. Distributions are permitted only in the form of dividends from the net
profit of the borrower for the prior fiscal year and the borrower may not make any
distributions prior to making 12 amortization payments under the credit facility. As a result,
no distributions were permitted to be paid prior to October 2014. Before making a
distribution, the borrower must also meet certain other financial ratios. Other forms of
capital remuneration, such as the payment of management fees, are also not permitted
under the terms of the facility.

-----

provide that Midco will pay to the Issuer interest and principal as it becomes payable on the
corresponding series of Notes (including any additional amounts due thereunder).

We estimate that the gross proceeds from the Offering will be e575.0 million. The gross
proceeds from the Offering along with cash on the balance sheet will be used (i) to fund the
Redemption, (ii) to pay a distribution to the shareholders of the Parent Guarantor and (iii) to
pay the fees, commissions and expenses incurred in connection with the Offering and the
Redemption. For further information, see ‘‘Use of Proceeds.’’

**_The Notes and the Proceeds Loans_**
The Notes will:

- be senior obligations of the Issuer;

- be secured by the Issue Date Collateral on the Issue Date and by the Post-Closing Collateral
within 60 days from the Issue Date, as set forth below under the caption ‘‘—Security,’’ which
security may be subject to the limitations described in ‘‘Limitations on Validity and
_Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law_
_Considerations;’’_

- rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future Indebtedness of the Issuer
that is not subordinated in right of payment to the Notes;

- rank senior in right of payment to any existing or future Indebtedness of the Issuer that is
subordinated in right of payment to the Notes;

- be effectively subordinated in right of payment to any existing or future Indebtedness of the
Issuer that is secured by property and assets that do not secure the Notes, to the extent of
the value of the property and assets securing such Indebtedness;

- be guaranteed on a senior basis by the Guarantors as of the Issue Date as set forth below
under the caption ‘‘—The Note Guarantees,’’ which guarantees may be subject to the
guarantee limitations described in ‘‘Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the
_Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations;’’ and_

- be structurally subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness of the Parent
Guarantor’s Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors, including the Project Finance Facilities (as
defined elsewhere in the Offering Memorandum).

The Proceeds Loans will be:

- general unsecured senior obligations of Midco;

- effectively subordinated to all existing and future secured borrowings of Midco to the extent
of the value of the assets so secured; and

- effectively subordinated (in an insolvency proceeding) to any non-related third party
borrowings of Midco, except for those borrowings that have been set aside as fraudulent by
a court.

The tranches of the Proceeds Loans that correspond to the net proceeds from the Fixed Rate
Notes will bear interest at a rate at least equal to the interest rate of the Fixed Rate Notes,
and interest on the tranches of the Proceeds Loans that correspond to the net proceeds from
the Fixed Rate Notes will be payable semi-annually in arrears on or before the corresponding
interest payment date under the Fixed Rate Notes. The tranches of the Proceeds Loans that
correspond to the net proceeds from the Floating Rate Notes will bear interest at a floating
rate at least equal to the interest rate of the Floating Rate Notes, and interest on the tranches
of the Proceeds Loans that correspond to the net proceeds from the Floating Rate Notes will

179


-----

be payable quarterly in arrears on or before the corresponding interest payment date under
the Floating Rate Notes.

The maturity dates of the tranches of the Proceeds Loans will be the same as the maturity
dates of the applicable Notes. Except as otherwise required by law, all payments under the
Proceeds Loans will be made without deductions or withholding for, or on account of, any
applicable tax. In the event that Midco is required to make any such deduction or withholding,
such entity will gross-up each payment to the Issuer to ensure that the Issuer receives and
retains a net payment equal to the payment which it would have received had no such
deduction or withholding been made. Upon the issuance of any Additional Notes, the proceeds
thereof will be loaned to Midco pursuant to an additional loan, loans or tranches thereof on
substantially the same terms as the Proceeds Loans.

**_The Note Guarantees_**
The Note Guarantee of each Guarantor:

- will be a senior secured obligation of such Guarantor, secured by the Issue Date Collateral on
the Issue Date and by the Post-Closing Collateral within 60 days from the Issue Date as set
forth below under the caption ‘‘—Security;’’

- will rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future Indebtedness of that
Guarantor that is not subordinated in right of payment to the Note Guarantee of that
Guarantor;

- will rank senior in right of payment with any existing and any future Indebtedness of such
Guarantor that is subordinated in right of payment to the relevant Note;

- will be effectively subordinated in right of payment to any existing or future Indebtedness of
such Guarantor that is secured by property and assets that do not secure such Note
Guarantee, to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such Indebtedness;
and

- will be structurally subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness of such Guarantor’s
Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors, including the Project Financing Facilities.

Not all of the Subsidiaries of the Parent Guarantor will be Guarantors. In the event of a
bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any of these non-guarantor Subsidiaries, the
non-guarantor Subsidiaries will pay the holders of their debt and their trade creditors before
they will be able to distribute any of their assets to the Issuer or the Guarantors.

For the twelve months ended and as of September 30, 2019, the Guarantors represented 83.7%
of our Adjusted Revenue, 85.6% of our Adjusted EBITDA and 90.2% of our total assets (and
87.9% of our tangible and intangible assets, excluding goodwill), in each case excluding the
results and assets of our non-wholly owned subsidiaries and our Non-Recourse Restricted
Subsidiaries. For the twelve months ended and as of September 30, 2019, our non-wholly
owned subsidiaries and our Non-Recourse Restricted Subsidiaries, collectively, generated 18.4%
of Adjusted Revenue and 14.4% of Adjusted EBITDA and, as of September 30, 2019, and held
11.7% of total assets (and 12.3% of tangible and intangible assets, excluding goodwill).

For the twelve months ended and as of September 30, 2019, the Non-Guarantor Restricted
Subsidiaries represented 16.3% of our Adjusted Revenue, 9.8% of our Adjusted EBITDA and
14.4% of our total assets (and 12.1% of our tangible and intangible assets, excluding
goodwill), in each case excluding the results and assets of our non-wholly owned subsidiaries
and our Non-Recourse Restricted Subsidiaries. As of September 30, 2019, after giving pro forma
effect to the Offering and the Redemption, the non-Guarantor Subsidiaries had outstanding
gross debt of e53.6 million (excluding accrued interest and amortized cost), comprising Project
Finance Facilities. For further information, see ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements.’’

180


-----

The Issuer is a special purpose vehicle and has no significant business operations. The Parent
Guarantor and Midco are holding companies. Each of the Parent Guarantor and Midco conduct
all of its operations through its Subsidiaries, and, therefore, will depend on the cash flow of its
Subsidiaries to meet its obligations, including (in the case of Midco) under the Proceeds Loans.

The obligations of the Guarantors will be contractually limited under the Guarantees to reflect
limitations under applicable law with respect to maintenance of share capital, corporate
benefit, fraudulent conveyance, financial assistance, thin capitalization, distributable reserves
and other legal restrictions applicable to the Guarantors and their respective shareholders,
directors and general partners. For a description of such contractual limitations, see
‘‘Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain
_Insolvency Law Considerations.’’ In particular, (a) the Note Guarantees of Empark, Dornier,_
Aparcamientos de Bilbao, S.A., Estacionamientos Alh ´ondiga, S.A., Empark Aparcamientos
Andaluc´ıa, S.L.U. and Maksu Espa ˜na, S.L. will be limited to the value of the Amended and
Restated Debt Repayment Proceeds Loan and certain cash proceeds of the Offering retained at
Midco (which is expected to be in total approximately e460 million) and will not secure those
obligations or liabilities which, if secured, will constitute an infringement of Spanish financial
assistance laws in accordance with Articles 143.2 and 150 of the Spanish Companies Act and
(b) in order to avoid Portuguese financial assistance issues, the Note Guarantees of Emparque
and Esli will be limited to part of the value of the Amended and Restated Debt Repayment
Proceeds Loan (which, in connection with Portuguese stamp tax issues, is expected to be
e29.97 million and e25.32 million, respectively). For a brief description of such limitations, see
‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes—Certain of the Note Guarantees will be limited to a
_specified amount, and each Note Guarantee will be subject to certain limitations on_
_enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may_
_limit its validity and enforceability’’ and ‘‘Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the_
_Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.’’_

Claims of creditors of the non-guarantor Subsidiaries, including trade creditors and creditors
holding indebtedness or guarantees issued by such non-guarantor Subsidiaries, and claims of
preferred stockholders of such non-guarantor Subsidiaries, generally will have priority with
respect to the assets and earnings of such non-guarantor Subsidiaries over the claims of the
Issuer’s creditors, including holders of the Notes. Accordingly, the Notes and the Note
Guarantees will be effectively subordinated to creditors and preferred stockholders, if any, of
such non-guarantor Subsidiaries. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Structure—The Notes
_will each be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of non-Guarantor subsidiaries.’’_

As of the Issue Date, all of the Parent Guarantor’s Subsidiaries will be ‘‘Restricted Subsidiaries’’
for purposes of the Indenture. However, subject to compliance with the terms of the Indenture,
the Parent Guarantor will be permitted to designate Restricted Subsidiaries (other than the
Issuer) as ‘‘Unrestricted Subsidiaries.’’ The restrictive covenants in the Indenture do not apply to
Unrestricted Subsidiaries.

## Principal, Maturity and Interest

The Issuer will issue e575.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Notes in this Offering. The
Issuer may issue additional Fixed Rate Notes (the ‘‘Additional Fixed Rate Notes’’) and additional
Floating Rate Notes (the ‘‘Additional Floating Rate Notes’’ and together with the Additional
Fixed Rate Notes, the ‘‘Additional Notes’’) under the Indenture from time to time after this
Offering. Any issuance of Additional Notes is subject to the covenants in the Indenture. The
Notes and any Additional Notes subsequently issued under the Indenture will be treated as a
single class for all purposes under the Indenture, including, without limitation, waivers,
amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase, except as otherwise provided in the
Indenture. The Issuer will issue Notes in denominations of e100,000 and integral multiples of
e1,000 in excess thereof. The Fixed Rate Notes will mature on, 2028. The Floating Rate
Notes will mature on, 2027.

181


-----

**_Fixed Rate Notes_**
Interest on the Fixed Rate Notes will accrue at the rate of % per annum. Interest on the
Fixed Rate Notes will be payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on and of
each year commencing on,, 2020. The Issuer will make each interest payment to the
holders of record of the Fixed Rate Notes on the immediately preceding and . If
a particular interest payment date is not a Business Day at the place at which such payment is
to be made, then the payment date will be the next Business Day at such place and the holders
of Notes will not be entitled to any further interest in the intervening period or other payment
as a result of any such delays. The redemption price at maturity will be 100% of the par value
of the Fixed Rate Notes.

Interest on the Fixed Rate Notes will accrue from the date of original issuance or, if interest has
already been paid, from the date it was most recently paid. Interest will be computed on the
basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. Interest on overdue principal and
interest on the Fixed Rate Notes, including Additional Amounts, if any, will accrue at a rate
that is 1.0% higher than the interest rate on the Fixed Rate Notes. In no event will the rate of
interest on the Fixed Rate Notes be higher than the maximum rate permitted by applicable
law.

**_Floating Rate Notes_**
Interest on the Floating Rate Notes will be payable quarterly in arrears on,,
and of each year, commencing on, 2020. The Issuer will make each
interest payment to the holders of record on the immediately preceding,,
and . If a particular interest payment date is not a Business Day at the place at
which such payment is to be made, then the payment date will be the next Business Day at
such place and the holders of Notes will not be entitled to any further interest in the
intervening period or other payment as a result of any such delays. The redemption price at
maturity will be 100% of the par value of the Floating Rate Notes.

Each Floating Rate Note will bear interest at a rate per annum (the ‘‘Applicable Rate’’), reset
quarterly, equal to EURIBOR (with a 0% floor) plus %, as determined by the calculation
agent (the ‘‘Calculation Agent’’), which will initially be The Bank of New York Mellon, London
Branch.

Interest on the Floating Rate Notes will accrue from the date of original issuance or, if interest
has already been paid, from the date it was most recently paid. Interest will be computed on
the basis of the actual number of days in the interest period concerned divided by 360. Interest
on overdue principal and interest on the Fixed Rate Notes, including Additional Amounts, if
any, will accrue at a rate that is 1.0% higher than the interest rate on the Fixed Rate Notes. In
no event will the rate of interest on the Fixed Rate Notes be higher than the maximum rate
permitted by applicable law.

Set forth below is a summary of certain of the provisions from the Indenture relating to the
calculation of interest on the Floating Rate Notes.

‘‘Determination Date’’ with respect to an Interest Period, means the day that is two TARGET
Settlement Days preceding the first day of such Interest Period, except that the initial
Determination Date will be, 2020.

‘‘EURIBOR’’ with respect to an Interest Period, means the rate (expressed as a percentage per
annum) for deposits in euro for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two
TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date that appears on Reuters Page 248 as of
11:00 a.m. Brussels time, on the Determination Date, provided, however, that EURIBOR shall
never be less than 0%. If Reuters Page 248 does not include such a rate or is unavailable on a
Determination Date, then the rate for the Interest Period will be the rate in effect with respect
to the immediately preceding Interest Period.

182


-----

In the event that EURIBOR is no longer being calculated or administered or is otherwise no
longer generally accepted in the Euro-zone for the purposes of determining floating rates of
interest in respect of euro-denominated securities, the alternative basis for determining the
rate of interest on the Notes will be any successor rate generally accepted in the euro zone for
the purposes of determining floating rates of interest in respect of euro-denominated
securities, as identified by the Issuer in good faith; provided that, in the event that there is no
generally accepted successor rate to EURIBOR in the good faith judgment of the Issuer, the
Issuer, in consultation with an Independent Financial Advisor, shall determine a reasonably
appropriate alternative basis for determining the rate of interest (and any applicable
adjustment spread to reduce or eliminate, to the extent reasonably practicable in the
circumstances, any economic prejudice or benefit (as the case may be) to holders as a result of
the replacement of EURIBOR) on the Notes; provided, further, that any such alternative basis
adopted pursuant to this paragraph shall in all cases never be less than 0%. Following the
adoption of an alternative basis pursuant to this paragraph, all references to ‘‘EURIBOR’’ in the
Indenture shall be deemed to refer to such alternative basis. The Issuer shall promptly
thereafter notify the holders of the Notes and (via an Officer’s Certificate) the Calculation
Agent of the new rate replacing EURIBOR, and the Calculation Agent shall be entitled to rely
on such (without liability to any Person) as sufficient evidence thereof.

‘‘Euro-zone’’ means the region comprised of member states of the European Union that adopt
the euro.

‘‘Independent Financial Advisor’’ means an investment banking or accounting firm of
international standing or any third party appraiser of international standing; provided,
however, that such firm or appraiser is not an Affiliate of the Issuer.

‘‘Interest Period’’ means the period commencing on and including an interest payment date
and ending on and including the day immediately preceding the next succeeding interest
payment date, with the exception that the first Interest Period will commence on and include
the Issue Date and end on and include, 2027.

‘‘Representative Amount’’ means the greater of (i) e1,000,000 and (ii) an amount that is
representative for a single transaction in the relevant market at the relevant time.

‘‘Reuters Page 248’’ means the display page so designated by Reuters (or such other page as
may replace that page on that service, or such other service as may be nominated as the
information vendor).

‘‘TARGET Settlement Day’’ means any day on which the Trans-European Automated Real-Time
Gross Settlement Express Transfer (TARGET) System is open.

The Calculation Agent will, as soon as practicable after 11:00 a.m. (London time) on each
Determination Date, determine the Applicable Rate and calculate the aggregate amount of
interest payable in respect of the following Interest Period (the ‘‘Interest Amount’’). The
Interest Amount will be calculated by applying the Applicable Rate to the principal amount of
each Floating Rate Note outstanding at the commencement of the Interest Period, multiplying
each such amount by the actual amounts of days in the Interest Period concerned divided by
360. All percentages resulting from any of the above calculations will be rounded, if necessary,
to the nearest one hundred thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a
percentage point being rounded upwards (e.g., 4.876545% (or .04876545) being rounded to
4.87655% (or .0487655)). The determination of the Applicable Rate and the Interest Amount by
the Calculation Agent will, in the absence of willful default, bad faith or manifest error, be
final and binding on all parties. In no event will the rate of interest on the Floating Rate Notes
be higher than the maximum rate permitted by applicable law.

183


-----

## Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes

The Issuer will maintain one or more paying agents (each, a ‘‘Paying Agent’’) for the Notes in
London, United Kingdom. The initial Paying Agent will be The Bank of New York Mellon,
London Branch.

The Issuer will also maintain one or more registrars (each, a ‘‘Registrar’’) and a transfer agent
(the ‘‘Transfer Agent’’). The initial Registrar will be The Bank of New York Mellon SA/NV,
Luxembourg Branch. The initial Transfer Agent will be The Bank of New York Mellon SA/NV,
Luxembourg Branch. The Registrar and the Transfer Agent maintain a register reflecting
ownership of Definitive Registered Notes outstanding from time to time and will make
payments on and facilitate transfers of Definitive Registered Notes on behalf of the Issuer.

The Issuer may change each of the Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent without prior
notice to the holders of such Notes. For so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of
the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted for trading on the Euro MTF market and the
rules of this exchange so require, the Issuer will publish a notice of any change of Paying
Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar on the website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange
(www.bourse.lu).

## Transfer and Exchange

Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A
under the U.S. Securities Act (‘‘Rule 144A’’) will initially be represented by one or more global
Notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the ‘‘144A Global Note’’), and
Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act
(‘‘Regulation S’’) will initially be represented by one or more global Notes in registered form
without interest coupons attached (the ‘‘Regulation S Global Note’’ and, together with the
144A Global Note, the ‘‘Global Notes’’).

During the ‘‘40-day distribution compliance period’’ (as such term is defined in Rule 902 of
Regulation S), book-entry interests in the Regulation S Global Note may be transferred only to
non-U.S. Persons under Regulation S or to persons whom the transferor reasonably believes are
‘‘qualified institutional buyers’’ within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the
requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with applicable transfer restrictions and
any applicable securities laws of any state of the United States or any other jurisdiction. The
Notes will be subject to certain other restrictions on transfer and certification requirements, as
described under the caption ‘‘Notice to Investors.’’

Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (the ‘‘Book-Entry Interests’’) will be limited to
persons that have accounts with Euroclear or Clearstream (each as defined elsewhere in this
Offering Memorandum) or Persons that may hold interests through such participants.
Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the
restrictions on transfer and certification requirements summarized below and described more
fully under the caption ‘‘Notice to Investors.’’ In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests
between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear or Clearstream
pursuant to customary procedures and subject to the applicable rules and procedures
established by Euroclear or Clearstream and their respective participants.

Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes
delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Note only upon delivery
by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect
that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S.

No Book-Entry Interest in any Global Note representing the Fixed Rate Notes (the ‘‘Global Fixed
_Rate Notes’’) and no Definitive Registered Note issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest in_
the Global Fixed Rate Notes (the ‘‘Definitive Registered Fixed Rate Notes’’) may be transferred

184


-----

or exchanged for any Book-Entry Interest in any Global Note representing the Floating Rate
Notes (the ‘‘Global Floating Rate Notes’’) or any Definitive Registered Note issued in exchange
for a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Floating Rate Notes (the ‘‘Definitive Registered Floating
_Rate Notes’’), and no Book-Entry Interest in the Global Floating Rate Notes and no Definitive_
Registered Floating Rate Note may be transferred or exchanged for any Book-Entry Interest in
any Global Fixed Rate Note or any Definitive Registered Fixed Rate Note.

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding
paragraphs will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which
it was transferred and will become a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was
transferred. Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it will become subject to all transfer
restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in the Global Note
to which it was transferred.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of
e100,000 and integral multiples of e1,000 in excess thereof, upon receipt by the Registrar of
instructions relating thereto and any certificates and other documentation required by the
Indenture. It is expected that such instructions will be based upon directions received by
Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, from the participant which owns the relevant
Book-Entry Interests.

Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth
in the Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Issuer in compliance with applicable law,
be subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the restrictions on transfer summarized
below and described more fully under the caption ‘‘Notice to Investors.’’

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Notes issued as Definitive Registered
Notes may be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of
e100,000 and integral multiples of e1,000 in excess thereof, to persons who take delivery
thereof in the form of Definitive Registered Notes. In connection with any such transfer or
exchange, the Indenture will require the transferring or exchanging holder to, among other
things, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, furnish information
regarding the account of the transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream, where appropriate, furnish
certain certificates and opinions, and pay any Taxes (as defined herein) in connection with such
transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made without charge to the
holder, other than any Taxes payable in connection with such transfer or exchange.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer is not required to register the transfer of any
Definitive Registered Notes:

(1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of the Notes;

(2) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of Notes to be
redeemed in part;

(3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date;
or

(4) which the holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a
Change of Control Offer or an Asset Sale Offer.

## Additional Amounts

All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer (including any successor entity) under or with
respect to the Notes (whether or not in the form of Definitive Registered Notes) or any of the
Guarantors (including any successor entities) with respect to any Note Guarantee will be made
free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any present or
future Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of (1) any jurisdiction in which the Issuer or any

185


-----

Guarantor is then incorporated, engaged in business, organized, or otherwise resident for tax
purposes or any political subdivision thereof or therein having the power to Tax or (2) any
jurisdiction from or through which payment is made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any
Guarantor (including the jurisdiction of any Paying Agent) or any political subdivision thereof
or therein (each, a ‘‘Tax Jurisdiction’’) unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then
required by law. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any such Taxes imposed
or levied by or on behalf of the relevant Tax Jurisdiction will at any time be required to be
made from any payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer under or with respect to the
Notes or any of the Guarantors under or with respect to any Note Guarantee, including
payments of principal, redemption price, purchase price, interest or premium, the Issuer or the
relevant Guarantor, as applicable, will pay such additional amounts (the ‘‘Additional Amounts’’)
as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received in respect of such payments by the
holder after such withholding, deduction or imposition (including any such withholding,
deduction or imposition from such Additional Amounts) will equal the respective amounts that
would have been received in respect of such payments in the absence of such withholding or
deduction; provided, however, that no Additional Amounts will be payable with respect to:

(1) any Taxes that would not have been imposed but for the existence of any actual or
deemed (pursuant to applicable Tax law of the relevant Tax Jurisdiction, such as, if
applicable, a connection of a partnership that is attributed to the partners/beneficial
owners) present or former connection between the holder or the beneficial owner of the
Notes and the relevant Tax Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, the holder or
beneficial owner being, or having been, a citizen, national or resident, being, or having
been, engaged in a trade or business, being, or having been, physically present in or
having or having had a permanent establishment in such jurisdiction for Tax purposes),
other than any connection arising from the acquisition or holding of such Note, the
enforcement of rights under such Note or under a Note Guarantee or the receipt of any
payments in respect of such Note or a Note Guarantee;

(2) any Taxes withheld, deducted or imposed as a result of the presentation of a Note for
payment (where Notes are in the form of Definitive Registered Notes and where
presentation is required) more than 30 days after the relevant payment is first made
available for payment to the holder (except to the extent that the holder would have been
entitled to Additional Amounts had the Note been presented on the last day of such
30 day period);

(3) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, personal property, transfer or similar Taxes;

(4) any Taxes that are not payable by way of deduction or withholding from payments under,
or with respect to, the Notes or with respect to any Note Guarantee;

(5) any Taxes imposed, deducted or withheld by reason of the failure of the holder or
beneficial owner of Notes to comply with any reasonable written request of the Issuer or
any Guarantor addressed to the holder or beneficial owner, as the case may be, and made
at least 60 days before any such withholding or deduction would be payable to satisfy any
certification, identification, information or other reporting requirements, whether required
by statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of a Tax Jurisdiction, as a
precondition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of deduction or withholding of,
Taxes imposed by the Tax Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, a certification that the
holder or beneficial owner is not resident in the Tax Jurisdiction), but in each case, only to
the extent the holder or beneficial owner is legally entitled to satisfy such requirement;

(6) any Tax imposed on or with respect to any payment by the Issuer or the relevant
Guarantor to the holder for the benefit of a beneficial owner if such holder or beneficial
owner is a fiduciary or partnership or person other than the sole beneficial owner of such
payment to the extent that Taxes would not have been imposed on such payment had
such holder or beneficial owner been the sole beneficial owner of such Notes;

186


-----

(7) Notes held by or on behalf of a holder who does not provide to the Issuer, the relevant
Guarantor or an agent acting on behalf of the Issuer or the Guarantor, as the case may be,
the information concerning such holder as may be required in order to comply with the
procedures that may be implemented to comply with any interpretation of Royal
Decree 1065/2007 of 27 July, as amended by Royal Decree 1145/2011 of 29 July, eventually
made by the Spanish tax authorities;

(8) any Taxes that are imposed or withheld pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the U.S.
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ‘‘U.S. Internal Revenue Code’’) (or any
amended or successor version of such Sections), any regulations promulgated thereunder,
any official interpretations thereof, any similar law or regulations adopted pursuant to an
intergovernmental agreement between a non-U.S. jurisdiction and the United States with
respect to the foregoing or any agreements entered into pursuant to Section 1471(b)(1) of
the U.S. Internal Revenue Code; or

(9) any combination of items (1) through (8) above.

In addition to the foregoing, the Issuer and the Guarantors will also pay and indemnify the
holder for any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court or documentary Taxes, or any
other excise or property Taxes, charges or similar levies (including penalties, interest and any
other reasonable expenses related thereto) which are levied by any Tax Jurisdiction on the
execution, delivery, issuance, enforcement or registration of any of the Notes, the Indenture,
any Notes Guarantee or any other document or instrument referred to therein, or enforcement
of, any of the Notes or any Notes Guarantee (other than, in each case, on or in connection
with a transfer of the Notes other than the initial resale of the Notes by the Initial Purchasers)
or the receipt of any payments with respect thereto (limited, solely in the case of taxes
attributable to the receipt of any payments with respect thereto, to any such taxes imposed in
a Tax Jurisdiction that are not excluded under clauses (1) through (3) and (5) through (8) or any
combination thereof).

If the Issuer or any Guarantor, as the case may be, becomes aware that it will be obligated to
pay Additional Amounts with respect to any payment under or with respect to the Notes or
any Notes Guarantee, each of the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as the case may be, will
deliver to the Trustee and the Paying Agent on a date that is at least 30 days prior to the date
of that payment (unless the obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior
to that payment date, in which case the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor shall notify the
Trustee and the Paying Agent promptly thereafter) an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that
Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount estimated to be so payable. The Officer’s
Certificate(s) must also set forth any other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to
pay such Additional Amounts to holders on the relevant payment date. The Issuer and the
relevant Guarantor will provide the Trustee and the Paying Agent with documentation
satisfactory to the Trustee and the Paying Agent evidencing the payment of Additional
Amounts. The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely solely without
independent investigation on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments
are necessary.

The Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will make all withholdings and deductions required by law
and will remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Tax authority in
accordance with applicable law. The Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will use its reasonable
efforts to obtain Tax receipts from each Tax authority evidencing the payment of any Taxes so
deducted or withheld. The Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will furnish to the Trustee and the
Paying Agent, within a reasonable time after the date the payment of any Taxes so deducted
or withheld is made, certified copies of Tax receipts evidencing payment by the Issuer or a
Guarantor, as the case may be, or if, notwithstanding such entity’s efforts to obtain receipts,
receipts are not obtained, other evidence of payments (reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee
and the Paying Agent) by such entity. Upon reasonable request, copies of Tax receipts or other

187


-----

evidence of payments, as the case may be, will be made available by the Trustee and the
Paying Agent to the holders or beneficial owners of the Notes.

Whenever in the Indenture or in this ‘‘Description of Notes’’ there is mentioned, in any context,
the payment of amounts based upon the principal amount of the Notes or of principal, interest
or of any other amount payable under, or with respect to, any of the Notes or any Note
Guarantee, such mention shall be deemed to include mention of the payment of Additional
Amounts to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be
payable in respect thereof.

The above obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture,
any transfer by a holder or beneficial owner of its Notes, and will apply, mutatis mutandis, to
any jurisdiction in which any successor Person to the Issuer or any Guarantor is incorporated,
engaged in business or otherwise resident for Tax purposes or any jurisdiction from or through
which such Person makes any payment on the Notes (or any Note Guarantee) and any
department or political subdivision thereof or therein having the power to Tax.

**_Intercreditor Agreement; Additional Intercreditor Agreements; Agreement to be Bound_**
The Indenture will provide that the Issuer, each Guarantor and the Trustee will be authorized
(without any further consent of the holders of the Notes) to enter into the Intercreditor
Agreement to give effect to the provisions described under the caption ‘‘Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.’’_

The Indenture will also provide that each holder of the Notes, by accepting its Note, will be
deemed to have:

1. appointed and authorized the Trustee to give effect to the provisions in the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents;

2. agreed to be bound by the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents; and

3. irrevocably appointed the Trustee to act on its behalf to enter into and comply with the
provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and
the Security Documents.

See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—The security interests in the Collateral will be
_granted to the Trustee or the Security Agent (as the case may be) rather than directly to the_
_holders of the Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce certain of the Collateral may_
_be restricted by local law.’’_

Similar provisions to those described above may be included in any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement (as defined below) entered into as described under the caption ‘‘—Certain
_Covenants—Additional or Amended Intercreditor Agreements.’’_

**_Notes Guarantee Release_**
The Note Guarantee of a Subsidiary Guarantor will terminate and be released:

(1) in connection with any sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of all or
substantially all of the assets of that Guarantor (including by way of merger, consolidation,
amalgamation or combination) to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect
to such transaction) the Parent Guarantor or a Restricted Subsidiary, if the sale, assignment,
transfer, conveyance or other disposition does not violate the provisions of the Indenture
described under the caption ‘‘—Asset Sales’’ or the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

188


-----

(2) in connection with any sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of
Capital Stock of that Guarantor (or Capital Stock of any Parent Holdco of such Guarantor)
to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) the Parent
Guarantor or a Restricted Subsidiary, if the sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other
disposition does not violate the provisions of the Indenture described under the caption
‘‘—Asset Sales’’ or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
and the Guarantor ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of the sale, assignment,
transfer, conveyance or other disposition;

(3) if the Parent Guarantor designates any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor to be an
Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture;

(4) in connection with certain enforcement actions taken by the creditors under certain of our
secured Indebtedness in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement as described under
the caption ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement’’ or
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(5) upon release of the guarantee of Indebtedness that resulted in the creation of the Note
Guarantee under the covenant described under the caption ‘‘—Certain Covenants—
_Additional Guarantees;’’_

(6) upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture
as described under the captions ‘‘—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance’’ and

‘‘—Certain Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets;’’ or

(10) otherwise in accordance with the terms of the Indenture.

Upon any occurrence giving rise to a termination and release of a Note Guarantee, as specified
above, the Trustee, subject to receipt of certain documents from the Issuer and/or Guarantor
and at the request and cost of the Issuer, will promptly execute any documents reasonably
required in order to evidence or effect such release, discharge and termination in respect of
such Note Guarantee.

The Issuer, the Guarantors and the Trustee will not be required to make a notation on the
Notes to reflect any Guarantee release, discharge or termination.

concessions (which include the rights to receive compensation, payments and owed
amounts under the concession agreements),

collectively, the ‘‘Post-Closing Collateral’’ and, together with the Issue Date Collateral, the
‘‘Collateral’’).

The Collateral will also secure on substantially the same basis (but without the quantitative
limit (other than the Collateral securing the issued and outstanding shares of Emparque) and
financial assistance limitations applicable to the Notes) the liabilities under the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement and may secure on substantially the same basis (but without the
quantitative limit (other than the Collateral securing the issued and outstanding shares of
Emparque) and financial assistance limitations applicable to the Notes) certain Hedging
Obligations, and certain other future indebtedness (including any Additional Notes); provided,
that lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and counterparties to certain
Hedging Obligations will receive proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral in priority to
holders of the Notes as further described under the caption ‘‘Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.’’_

Any proceeds received upon any enforcement over any Collateral, after all such super senior
liabilities have been discharged from such recoveries, will be applied pro rata in payment of all

190


-----

liabilities in respect of obligations under the Indenture and the Notes and any other
Indebtedness of the Parent Guarantor or its Restricted Subsidiaries permitted to be incurred
and secured by the Collateral on a pari passu basis pursuant to the Indenture and the
Intercreditor Agreement. No appraisals of the Collateral have been made in connection with
this offering of the Notes. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may
have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, the Collateral may not be able to be
sold in a short period of time, or at all. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes.’’ Under
the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent will not be required to accept or
act with respect to any Collateral if it is of a type or in a jurisdiction which the Security Agent
determines does not meet or comply with its internal regulations or policies or with any law or
regulation, or which might impose liability on the Security Agent.

The security over the Collateral will be limited as necessary to recognize certain limitations
arising under or imposed by local law and defenses generally available to providers of
Collateral (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable
preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, capital maintenance or similar
laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations
under applicable law. In particular, (a) the Collateral granted by Empark, Dornier, the maximum
secured amount under and Maksu Espa ˜na, S.L. will be limited to the value of the Amended
and Restated Debt Repayment Proceeds Loan and certain cash proceeds of the Offering
retained at Midco (which is expected to be in total approximately e460 million) and will not
secure those obligations or liabilities which, if secured, will constitute an infringement of
Spanish financial assistance laws in accordance with Articles 143.2 and 150 of the Spanish
Companies Act and (b) the maximum secured amount under the Collateral over the issued and
outstanding shares of Emparque will be limited to a maximum amount of e40 million. For a
brief description of such limitations, see ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes—Certain of
_the Note Guarantees will be limited to a specified amount, and each Note Guarantee will be_
_subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject_
_to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability’’ and ‘‘Limitations on Validity_
_and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law_
_Considerations.’’_

**_Security and Guarantee Documents_**
The Collateral Documents will directly secure the payment and performance when due of the
obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Indenture and the Notes, the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement and certain other future indebtedness as provided for in the
Collateral Documents.

In the event that the Parent Guarantor or its Subsidiaries enter into insolvency, bankruptcy or
similar proceedings, the Security Interests (as defined below) created under the Security and
Guarantee Documents or the rights and obligations set out in the Intercreditor Agreement
could be subject to potential challenges. If any challenge to the validity of the Security
Interests created under the Security and Guarantee Documents or the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement were to be successful, the Trustee and the holders of the Notes may not be able to
recover any amounts under the Security and Guarantee Documents. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks
_Relating to the Notes.’’_

Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenant described under the
caption ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest,’’ the Issuer and the Guarantors
are permitted to pledge the Collateral in connection with future incurrences of Indebtedness,
including any Additional Notes, or Indebtedness of its Restricted Subsidiaries, in each case
permitted under the Indenture and on terms consistent with the relative priority of such
Indebtedness.

191


-----

**_Priority_**
The relative priority among (a) the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and
the counterparties to certain of the Hedging Obligations secured by the Collateral, (b) the
Security Agent, the Trustee and agent under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement with
respect to the security interests in the Collateral (the ‘‘Security Interests’’); (c) the Noteholders
with respect to the Security Interests; and (d) certain other holders of Indebtedness from time
to time secured by the Collateral is established by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement,
the Indenture, the Security and Guarantee Documents, and may be set forth in any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and any other security documents creating security interests in the
Collateral.

See the caption ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.’’
Pursuant to the Indenture, Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreements
entered into on or after the Issue Date, the Collateral may be pledged to secure other
Indebtedness. See the caption ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest.’’

**_Release of Liens_**
The Issuer and the Guarantors will be entitled to the release of the Liens over the property and
other assets constituting Collateral securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees under any one
or more of the following circumstances:

(1) in connection with any sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition or
exchange of such property or assets to a Person that is not (either before or after giving
effect to such transaction) the Parent Guarantor or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, if the
sale assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition or exchange does not violate the
provisions of the Indenture as described under the caption ‘‘—Asset Sales;’’

(2) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Note Guarantee pursuant to the terms
of the Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such
Guarantor;

Subsidiary in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture, the release of the
property and assets of such Restricted Subsidiary;

(4) upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture
as provided under the captions ‘‘—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance’’ and
‘‘—Satisfaction and Discharge;’’

(5) in connection with certain enforcement actions taken by the creditors under certain of our
Indebtedness in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement as described under the
caption ‘‘—Intercreditor Agreement;’’

(6) upon the full and final payment of the Notes and performance of all Obligations of the
Issuer and the Guarantors under the Indenture and the Notes;

(7) as described under the captions ‘‘—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver’’ and ‘‘—Certain
_Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest;’’_

(8) upon release of the Lien that resulted in the creation of the Lien under the covenant
described under the caption ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Liens;’’

(9) as a result of a transaction permitted by the covenant described under the caption
‘‘—Certain Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets;’’ provided that, in case of
the Parent Guarantor, the Capital Stock of the Person formed by or surviving any such
transaction becomes part of the Collateral; or

(10) otherwise in accordance with the terms of the Indenture.

192


-----

At the reasonable request and cost of the Parent Guarantor or the Issuer (as applicable), the
Security Agent and the Trustee, if applicable, will as soon as reasonably practicable take all
necessary action required to effectuate any release of Collateral securing the Notes and the
Guarantees, in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and the relevant Collateral
Document or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement. Each of
the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Security Agent without the consent of the
holders of the Notes or any action on the part of the Trustee.

## Security Agent

The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch will act as Security Agent under the Security and
Guarantee Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement until such time, if any, that a new
Security Agent is appointed under the relevant provisions of the Security and Guarantee
Documents and/or the Intercreditor Agreement and/or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

Neither the Trustee nor the Security Agent nor any of their respective officers, directors,
employees, attorneys or agents will be responsible or liable for the existence, genuineness,
value or protection of any property securing the Notes or any Notes Guarantee, for the
legality, enforceability, effectiveness or sufficiency of the Collateral, for the creation, perfection,
priority, sufficiency or protection of any Lien, or for any defect or deficiency as to any such
matters, or for any failure to demand, collect, foreclose or realize upon or otherwise enforce
any of the Liens or the Security and Guarantee Documents or any delay in doing so.

one or more conditions precedent. If such redemption or notice is subject to satisfaction of one
or more conditions precedent, such notice shall state that, in the Issuer’s or Parent Guarantor’s
discretion, the redemption date may be delayed until such time as any or all such conditions
shall be satisfied (provided, however, that in any case such redemption date shall be no more
than 60 days from the date on which such notice is first given), or such redemption may not
occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not
have been satisfied or waived by the redemption date, or by the redemption date so delayed.
In addition, the Issuer or Parent Guarantor may provide in such notice that payment of the
redemption price and performance of the Issuer’s obligations with respect to such redemption
may be performed by another Person.

## Post-Tender Redemption

In connection with any tender offer for the Fixed Rate Notes or the Floating Rate Notes, if
holders of Notes of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the applicable
outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the
Issuer, or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the
Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, the Issuer or such third party will
have the right upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than
30 days following such tender offer expiration date, to redeem the applicable Notes that
remain outstanding in whole, but not in part, following such purchase, at a price equal to the
price offered to each other holder of Notes in such tender offer, plus, to the extent not
included in the tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but not
including, such redemption date.

## Redemption for Changes in Taxes

Either the Issuer or a Guarantor may redeem the Notes, in whole but not in part, at its
discretion at any time upon giving not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice to the
holders of the Notes (which notice will be irrevocable and given in accordance with the
procedures described under the caption ‘‘—Selection and Notice’’), at a redemption price equal
to 100% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to, but not including, the date fixed by the Issuer for redemption (a ‘‘Tax
_Redemption Date’’) and all Additional Amounts (if any) then due and which will become due_
on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise (subject to the right of
holders of the Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant
interest payment date and Additional Amounts (if any) in respect thereof), if on the next date
on which any amount would be payable in respect of the Notes or any Note Guarantee, the
Issuer or the relevant Guarantor is or would be required to pay Additional Amounts, and the
Issuer or the relevant Guarantor cannot avoid any such payment obligation by taking
reasonable measures available (but, in the case of the relevant Guarantor, only if such amount
cannot be paid to the Issuer or another Guarantor who can pay such amount without the
obligation to pay Additional Amounts where this would be reasonable), and the requirement
arises as a result of:

(1) any amendment to, or change in, the laws (or any regulations or rulings promulgated
thereunder) or relevant treaties of a relevant Tax Jurisdiction which change or amendment
is publicly announced and becomes effective on or after the Issue Date (or, if the
applicable Tax Jurisdiction became a Tax Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date, such
later date); or

(2) any amendment to, or change in, an official written interpretation or position regarding
the application or administration of such laws, treaties, regulations or rulings (including by
virtue of a holding, judgment, order by a court of competent jurisdiction or a change in
published administrative practice) which amendment or change is announced and becomes
effective on or after the Issue Date (or, if the applicable Tax Jurisdiction became a Tax

195


-----

Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date, such later date) (each of the foregoing
clauses (1) and (2), a ‘‘Change in Tax Law’’).

The Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will not give any such notice of redemption earlier than
60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as applicable,
would be obligated to make such payment or withholding if a payment in respect of the Notes
or any Note Guarantee was then due, and the obligation to pay Additional Amounts must be
in effect (or be scheduled to come into effect on or prior to the next date on which any
amount would be payable under or in respect of the Notes or any Note Guarantee) at the time
such notice is given. Prior to the publication or, where relevant, mailing of any notice of
redemption of the Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee (a) an
Officer’s Certificate stating that obligation to pay such Additional Amounts cannot be avoided
by the Issuer or a Guarantor (as the case may be) taking reasonable measures available to it
(but in the case of a Guarantor, only if the payment giving rise to such requirement cannot be
made by the Issuer or another Guarantor without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts
where this would be reasonable); and (b) a written opinion of independent tax counsel to the
Issuer or a Guarantor (as the case may be) of recognized standing qualified under the laws of
the relevant Tax Jurisdiction to the effect that the Issuer or such Guarantor has or will become
obligated to pay such Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law.

The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely on such Officer’s Certificate and opinion of
counsel as sufficient evidence of the existence and satisfaction of the conditions precedent as
described above, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the holders of the Notes.

The foregoing will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor Person to
the Issuer, applicable, is incorporated or organized, engaged in business or resident for Tax
purposes or any jurisdiction from or through which any payment on the Notes is made by or
on behalf of such Person and any political subdivision thereof or therein.

## General

The Parent Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries may repurchase Notes at any time and
from time to time in the open market or otherwise.

Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under the caption ‘‘—Selection and Notice.’’

If the Parent Guarantor or the Issuer effects an optional redemption of Notes, so long as the
Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted for
trading on the Euro MTF market and the rules of this exchange so require, the Issuer will
publish notices of an optional redemption on the website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange
(www.bourse.lu).

Unless the Parent Guarantor or the Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price,
interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions thereof called for redemption on the
applicable redemption date. If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest record
date and on or before the related interest payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest will
be paid to the Person in whose name the Note is registered at the close of business on such
record date, and no additional interest will be payable to holders whose Notes will be subject
to redemption by the Parent Guarantor or the Issuer.

## Mandatory Redemption and Sinking Fund

The Issuer is not required to make mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with
respect to the Notes.

196

## Repurchase at the Option of Holders

**_Change of Control_**
Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, each holder of Notes will have the right to
require the Issuer to repurchase all or any part (in integral multiples of e1,000; provided that
Notes of e100,000 or less may only be redeemed in whole and not in part) of that holder’s
Notes pursuant to the offer described below (the ‘‘Change of Control Offer’’). In the Change of
Control Offer, the Issuer will offer a payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal
amount of Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if
any, on the Notes repurchased to the date of purchase (the ‘‘Change of Control Payment’’),
subject to the rights of holders of Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on
the relevant interest payment date. Within 60 days following any Change of Control, the Issuer
will mail a notice to each holder of the Notes at such holder’s registered address or otherwise
deliver a notice in accordance with the procedures described under the caption ‘‘—Selection
_and Notice,’’ stating that a Change of Control Offer is being made and offering to repurchase_
Notes on the date (the ‘‘Change of Control Payment Date’’) specified in the notice, which date
will be no earlier than 10 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed
or delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the Indenture and described in such
notice.

The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the U.S. Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the ‘‘U.S. Exchange Act’’) and any other applicable securities laws and
regulations to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the
repurchase of the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the
provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control provisions
of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with any applicable securities laws and regulations and
will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Indenture by virtue of such
compliance.

On or prior to the Change of Control Payment Date, Midco will prepay the Proceeds Loans to
the extent necessary to finance the repurchase by the Issuer of any Notes tendered pursuant to
the Change of Control Offer.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered pursuant to the
Change of Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the paying agent or tender agent for such Change of Control Offer an
amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions of
Notes properly tendered; and

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Notes properly accepted together with
an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions of
Notes being purchased by the Issuer.

The Paying Agent or tender agent for such Change of Control Offer will promptly mail (or
cause to be delivered) to each holder of Notes properly tendered the Change of Control
Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee (or an authentication agent approved by it) will
promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each holder a
new Note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if
any. The Issuer will publicly announce the results of the Change of Control Offer on or as soon
as practicable after the Change of Control Payment Date.

If holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly
tender and do not withdraw such Notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Issuer, or any
third party making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the Notes

197


-----

validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, the Issuer or such third party will have
the right, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than
30 days following such purchase pursuant to such Change of Control Offer, to redeem all Notes
that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price in cash equal to 101% of the
principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the date of such
redemption (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive
interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

The provisions described above that require the Issuer to make a Change of Control Offer
following a Change of Control will be applicable whether or not any other provisions of the
Indenture are applicable. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the
Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the holders of the Notes to require that the
Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar
transaction.

The ability of the Issuer to repurchase Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be
limited by a number of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that constitute a
Change of Control would constitute a mandatory prepayment event and/or a default due to a
breach of undertaking under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. The future Indebtedness
of the Parent Guarantor and its Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions of certain events
that would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased
upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the holders of the Notes of their right to
require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under such Indebtedness, even
if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the
Issuer. Finally, the ability of the Issuer to pay cash to the holders of the Notes upon a
repurchase may be limited by its then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance
that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. See
‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes—We may not be able to obtain the funds required
_to repurchase the Notes upon a Change of Control.’’_

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if
(1) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise
in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of
Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes properly tendered and not
withdrawn under the Change of Control Offer, or (2) a notice of redemption has been given
pursuant to the Indenture as described under the caption ‘‘—Optional Redemption,’’ unless and
until there is a default in payment of the applicable redemption price. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance
of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a
definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control
Offer is made.

The definition of Change of Control includes a phrase relating to the direct or indirect sale,
lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of ‘‘all or substantially all’’ of the properties or
assets of the Parent Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there
is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase ‘‘substantially all,’’ there is no precise
established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder
of Notes to require the Issuer to repurchase its Notes as a result of a sale, lease, transfer,
conveyance or other disposition of less than all of the assets of the Parent Guarantor and its
Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to another Person or group may be uncertain.

The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to
repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the
consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes prior to the occurrence
of the Change of Control.

198


-----

For so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and
admitted for trading on the Euro MTF market and the rules of this exchange so require, the
Issuer will publish notices relating to the Change of Control Offer on the website of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu).

The Issuer or the Parent Guarantor (as the case may be) will comply with the requirements of
Rule 14e-1 under the U.S. Exchange Act and any other applicable securities laws and
regulations to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with each
repurchase of Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions
of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control provisions of the
Indenture, the Issuer or the Parent Guarantor will comply with the applicable securities laws
and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of
Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

## Selection and Notice

If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Paying Agent (or the
Registrar, as appropriate) will select Notes for redemption on a pro rata basis (or, in the case of
Notes issued in global form, in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and
Clearstream and as discussed under the caption ‘‘Book-Entry; Delivery and Form’’), unless
otherwise required by law or applicable stock exchange or depository requirements. None of
the Trustee, the Paying Agent or the Registrar shall be liable for any selections made by it in
accordance with this paragraph.

No Notes of e100,000 or less can be redeemed in part. Notices of redemption will be provided
at least 10 but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of Notes to
be redeemed at its registered address, except that redemption notices may be provided more
than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance
of the Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture.

If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note
will state the portion of the principal amount of that Note that is to be redeemed. A new Note
in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the original Note will be issued in the
name of the holder of Notes upon cancellation of the original Note. Notes called for
redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date,
interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of Notes called for redemption.

For Notes which are represented by global certificates held on behalf of Euroclear or
Clearstream, notices may be given by delivery of the relevant notices to Euroclear or
Clearstream for communication to entitled account holders in substitution for the aforesaid
notice.

In addition, so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange and admitted for trading on the Euro MTF market and the rules of this exchange so
require, the Issuer will publish notices (including with respect to optional redemptions,
repurchases at the option of the holders or any exchange offer) on the website of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu) and will inform the Luxembourg Stock Exchange
of the outstanding aggregate principal amounts of each series of the Notes then in issue.

Payment:

(a) no Default has occurred and is continuing or would immediately occur as a
consequence of such Restricted Payment;

(b) the Parent Guarantor would, at the time of such Restricted Payment and after giving
_pro forma effect thereto as if such Restricted Payment had been made at the_
beginning of the applicable four-quarter period, have been permitted to incur at least
e1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test set
forth in clause (1) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under the caption
‘‘—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock;’’ and

(c) such Restricted Payment, together with the aggregate amount of all other Restricted

Date (excluding Permitted Payments permitted by clauses (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8),
(9), (10), (11), (12), (15) and (19) of the next succeeding paragraph), is less than the

as one accounting period) from the beginning of the fiscal quarter commencing
immediately prior to the Issue Date to the end of the Parent Guarantor’s most
recently ended fiscal quarter for which internal financial statements are available at
the time of such Restricted Payment (or, if such Consolidated Net Income for such
period is a deficit, less 100% of such deficit); plus

200


-----

Disqualified Stock and Excluded Contributions) or from the issue or sale of convertible
or exchangeable Disqualified Stock of the Parent Guarantor or convertible or
exchangeable debt securities of the Parent Guarantor, in each case that have been
converted into or exchanged for Equity Interests of the Parent Guarantor (other than
Equity Interests (or Disqualified Stock or debt securities) sold to a Subsidiary of the
Parent Guarantor) or from the issuance or sale of Subordinated Shareholder Debt
(other than an issuance or sale to a Subsidiary of the Parent Guarantor); plus

(iii) to the extent that any Restricted Investment constituting a Restricted Payment that was
made after the Issue Date is (a) sold, disposed of or otherwise cancelled, liquidated or
repaid, 100% of the aggregate amount received in cash and the Fair Market Value of
the property or assets or the marketable securities received by the Parent Guarantor or
any Restricted Subsidiary (other than a disposition to the Parent Guarantor or any
Restricted Subsidiary), or (b) made in an entity that subsequently becomes a Restricted
Subsidiary, 100% of the Fair Market Value of the Restricted Investment of the Parent
Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries as of the date such entity becomes a
Restricted Subsidiary; plus

(iv) to the extent that any Unrestricted Subsidiary of the Parent Guarantor designated as
such after the Issue Date is redesignated as a Restricted Subsidiary or is merged or
consolidated into the Parent Guarantor or a Restricted Subsidiary, or all of the assets of
such Unrestricted Subsidiary are transferred to the Parent Guarantor or a Restricted
Subsidiary, the Fair Market Value of the property received by the Parent Guarantor or
Restricted Subsidiary or the Parent Guarantor’s Restricted Investment in such Subsidiary
as of the date of such redesignation, merger, consolidation or transfer of assets, to the
extent such investments reduced the restricted payments capacity under this clause (c)
and were not previously repaid or otherwise reduced; plus

(v) 100% of any dividends or distributions received by the Parent Guarantor or a Restricted
Subsidiary after the Issue Date from an Unrestricted Subsidiary or a Permitted Joint

(vi) upon the full and unconditional release of a Restricted Investment constituting a
Restricted Payment that is a guarantee made by the Parent Guarantor or one of its
Restricted Subsidiaries to any Person, an amount equal to the amount of such
guarantee,

_provided, that notwithstanding the foregoing, any amounts (such amounts, the ‘‘Excluded_
_Amounts’’) that would otherwise be included in the calculation of the amount available for_
Restricted Payments pursuant to the preceding clause (c) will be excluded to the extent (1) such
amounts result from the receipt of net cash proceeds or property or assets or marketable
securities received in contemplation of, or in connection with, an event that would otherwise
constitute a Change of Control pursuant to the definition thereof, (2) the purpose of, or the
effect of, the receipt of such net cash proceeds or property or assets or marketable securities
was to reduce the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio so that there would be an occurrence of a
Specified Change of Control Event that would not have been achieved without the receipt of
such net cash proceeds or property or assets or marketable securities and (3) no Change of
Control Offer is made in connection with such Change of Control in accordance with the
requirements of the Indenture.

Guarantor (other than through the issuance of Disqualified Stock or through an Excluded

preceding paragraph and will not be considered to be net cash proceeds from an Equity
Offering for purposes of the ‘‘Optional Redemption’’ provisions of the Indenture;

the Parent Guarantor or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries incurred in accordance with the
covenant described under the caption ‘‘—Limitation on Indebtedness and Issuance of

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) will be the Fair Market Value on the
date of the Restricted Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be transferred or issued
by the Parent Guarantor or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to the
Restricted Payment. Unsecured Indebtedness shall not be deemed to be subordinate or junior
to secured Indebtedness by virtue of its nature as unsecured Indebtedness.

For the purposes of calculating ‘‘Consolidated EBITDA,’’ pro forma effect shall be given to
Consolidated EBITDA on the same basis as for calculating the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that a Restricted
Payment (or portion thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of
Permitted Payments described in clauses (1) through (20) of the second paragraph of this
covenant, or is permitted pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant and/or one or more
of the clauses contained in the definition of ‘‘Permitted Investment,’’ the Parent Guarantor will
be entitled to classify such Restricted Payment or Investment (or portion thereof) on the date
of its payment or later reclassify (based on circumstances existing on the date of such
reclassification) such Restricted Payment or Investment (or portion thereof) in any manner that
complies with this covenant, including as an Investment pursuant to one of more clauses
contained in the definition of ‘‘Permitted Investment.’’

**_Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock_**
The Parent Guarantor will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to,
directly or indirectly, create, incur, issue, assume, guarantee or otherwise become directly or
indirectly liable, contingently or otherwise, with respect to (collectively, ‘‘incur’’) any
Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt), and the Parent Guarantor will not issue any
Disqualified Stock and the Parent Guarantor will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to
issue any Disqualified Stock or any shares of preferred stock; provided, however that the Parent
Guarantor may incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt) or issue Disqualified Stock and the
Restricted Subsidiaries may incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt) or issue any
Disqualified Stock or preferred stock if:

(1) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Parent Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries
would have been at least 2.0 to 1.0, determined on a pro forma basis (including a pro
_forma application of the net proceeds therefrom), as if the additional Indebtedness had_
been incurred or the Disqualified Stock or preferred stock had been issued, as the case may
be, at the beginning of such four quarter period; and

(2) if the Indebtedness is Senior Secured Indebtedness, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net
Leverage Ratio for the Parent Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been
less than 7.1 to 1.0, determined on a pro forma basis (including a pro forma application of
the net proceeds therefrom), as if the additional Senior Secured Indebtedness had been
incurred or the Disqualified Stock or preferred stock had been issued, as the case may be,
on the Calculation Date (as defined herein).

205


-----

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the incurrence of any of the following
items of Indebtedness (collectively, ‘‘Permitted Debt’’):

(1) the incurrence by the Issuer and the Guarantors of Indebtedness under Credit Facilities
(including in respect of letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances issued or created
thereunder), in an aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding under this
clause (1) not to exceed the greater of e100.0 million and 100.0% of Consolidated EBITDA
plus, in the case of any refinancing of any Indebtedness permitted under this clause (1) or
any portion thereof, the aggregate amount of fees, underwriting discounts, premiums and
other costs and expenses incurred in connection with such refinancing;

(2) Indebtedness of the Parent Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary outstanding on the Issue
Date after giving pro forma effect to the Offering and the Redemption, including
Non-Recourse Restricted Subsidiary Project Indebtedness, other than Indebtedness described
in clauses (1) and (3) of this paragraph;

(3) the incurrence by the Issuer and the Guarantors of Indebtedness represented by the Notes
issued on the Issue Date (and, for the avoidance of doubt, excluding any Additional Notes)
and the related Note Guarantees (including any future Note Guarantees);

(4) the incurrence by the Parent Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness or
preferred stock representing:

(a) Lease Obligations, mortgage financings, purchase money obligations or other

price, lease expense, rental payments or cost of design, construction, installation or
improvement of property (real or personal), plant or equipment or other assets used or
useful in a Permitted Business of the Parent Guarantor or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries, whether through the direct purchase of assets or the Capital Stock of any
Person owning such assets, and any Indebtedness incurred to renew, refund, replace,
refinance, defease or discharge any Indebtedness incurred pursuant to this clause (4) in
an aggregate principal amount not to exceed the greater of e22.5 million and 25.0%
of Consolidated EBITDA at any time outstanding; and

(b) Ordinary Course Lease Obligations;

(5) the incurrence by the Parent Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary of Permitted

than through the issuance of Disqualified Stock or Excluded Contributions or Excluded

-----

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant:

(1) the amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date will be:

(a) in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount, the lesser of the
accreted value of such Indebtedness and the amount of the liability in respect thereof
determined in accordance with IFRS;

(b) the principal amount of the Indebtedness, as determined in accordance with IFRS, in
the case of any other Indebtedness; and

(c) in respect of Indebtedness of another Person secured by a Lien on the assets of the
specified Person, the lesser of:

(i) the Fair Market Value of such assets at the date of determination; and

(ii) the amount of the Indebtedness of the other Person, and

(2) subject to clause (3) below, in the event that an item of Indebtedness meets the criteria of
more than one of the categories of Permitted Debt described in clauses (1) through
(19) above, or is entitled to be incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant,
the Parent Guarantor, in its sole discretion, will be permitted to classify such item of
Indebtedness on the date of its incurrence and only be required to include the amount and
type of such Indebtedness in one of such clauses and will be permitted on the date of such
incurrence to divide and classify an item of Indebtedness in more than one of the types of
Indebtedness described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, from time to
time to reclassify all or a portion of such item of Indebtedness, in any manner that
complies with this covenant;

(3) any Indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement outstanding on the Issue
Date will be deemed to be incurred in reliance on the exception provided in clause (1) of
the definition of Permitted Debt and may not be reclassified;

(4) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other
similar instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in
the determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;

(5) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments are incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as incurred
pursuant to clause (1), (4), (17) or (18) of the second paragraph above or the first
paragraph above and the letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be
included;

(6) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Parent Guarantor or a Restricted
Subsidiary, or preferred stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the
maximum mandatory redemption or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any
redemption or repurchase premium) or the liquidation preference thereof;

(7) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one
provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision
and in part by one or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness;

(8) for the purposes of determining ‘‘Consolidated EBITDA’’ (x) pro forma effect shall be given
to Consolidated EBITDA on the same basis as for calculating the Consolidated Net Leverage
Ratio for the Parent Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries; and (y) in relation to
clause (1) of the second paragraph of this covenant, Consolidated EBITDA shall be
measured on the most recent date on which new commitments are obtained (in the case
of revolving facilities) or the date on which new Indebtedness is incurred (in the case of

210


-----

term facilities) and for the period of the most recent four consecutive fiscal quarters
ending prior to such date for which such internal consolidated financial statements of the
Parent Guarantor are available; and

(9) the incurrence by an Unrestricted Subsidiary of the Parent Guarantor of Non-Recourse Debt
will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness or an issuance of Disqualified
Stock for purposes of this covenant; provided, however, that if any such Indebtedness
ceases to be Non-Recourse Debt of such Unrestricted Subsidiary, such Indebtedness will be
deemed to constitute an incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary of the
Parent Guarantor.

The accrual of interest or preferred stock dividends, the accretion or amortization of original
issue discount, the payment of interest on any Indebtedness in the form of additional
Indebtedness, the reclassification of preferred stock as Indebtedness due to a change in
accounting principles, and the payment of dividends on preferred stock or Disqualified Stock in
the form of additional shares of the same class of preferred stock or Disqualified Stock or the
reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness as of the Issue Date
due to a change in IFRS will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness or an issuance
of preferred stock or Disqualified Stock for purposes of this covenant.

For purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction on the
incurrence of Indebtedness, the euro equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness
denominated in a different currency shall be utilized, calculated based on the relevant currency
exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was incurred; provided, however, that
(i) if such Indebtedness denominated in non-euro currency is subject to a Currency Exchange
Protection Agreement with respect to euro the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in euro
will be calculated so as to take account of the effects of such Currency Exchange Protection
Agreement; and (ii) the euro equivalent of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness
outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate
in effect on the Issue Date. The principal amount of any refinancing Indebtedness incurred in
the same currency as the Indebtedness being refinanced will be the euro equivalent of the
Indebtedness refinanced determined on the date such Indebtedness was originally incurred,
except that to the extent that:

(1) such euro equivalent was determined based on a Currency Exchange Protection
Agreement, in which case the refinancing Indebtedness will be determined in accordance
with the preceding sentence; and

(2) the principal amount of the refinancing Indebtedness exceeds the principal amount of the
Indebtedness being refinanced, in which case the euro equivalent of such excess will be
determined on the date such refinancing Indebtedness is being incurred.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness
that the Parent Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary may incur pursuant to this covenant
shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in exchange rates or
currency values.

**_Liens_**
The Parent Guarantor will not and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to,
directly or indirectly, create, incur, assume or otherwise cause or suffer to exist or become
effective any Lien of any kind securing Indebtedness upon any of their property or assets, now
owned or hereafter acquired, except (1) in the case of any property or asset that does not
constitute Collateral, (a) Permitted Liens or (b) if such Lien is not a Permitted Lien, to the
extent that the Notes and/or the Note Guarantees are secured on an equal and ratable pari
_passu basis with, or prior to, the obligations so secured (provided that if such obligations so_
secured are subordinated in right of payment to either the Notes or any Note Guarantee, on a

211


-----

senior priority basis) until such time as such obligations are no longer secured by a Lien and
(2) in the case of any property or asset that constitutes Collateral, Permitted Collateral Liens.

Any such Lien thereby created in favor of the Notes or any such Guarantee pursuant to the
preceding paragraph will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon
(i) the release and discharge of the initial Lien to which it relates, (ii) in the case of any such
Lien in favor of any such Guarantee, upon the termination and discharge of such Note
Guarantee in accordance with the terms of the Indenture or (iii) any other circumstances set
forth under the caption ‘‘—Security—Release of Liens.’’

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, (A) a Lien securing an item of
Indebtedness need not be permitted solely by reference to one category of Permitted Liens or
Permitted Collateral Liens, as applicable, described in the definitions of ‘‘Permitted Liens’’ or
‘‘Permitted Collateral Liens,’’ as applicable, or pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant
but may be permitted in part under any combination thereof and (B) in the event that a Lien
securing an item of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) meets the criteria of one or more of
the categories of Permitted Liens or Permitted Collateral Liens, as applicable, described in the
definitions of ‘‘Permitted Liens’’ or ‘‘Permitted Collateral Liens,’’ as applicable, or pursuant to
the first paragraph of this covenant, the Issuer shall, in its sole discretion, classify or reclassify,
or later divide, classify or reclassify, such Lien securing each item of Indebtedness (or any
portion thereof) in any manner that complies with this covenant and will only be required to
include the amount and type of such Lien or such item of Indebtedness secured by such Lien in
one of the clauses of the definitions of ‘‘Permitted Liens’’ or ‘‘Permitted Collateral Liens,’’ as
applicable, and such Lien securing such item of Indebtedness will be treated as being incurred
or existing pursuant to only one of such clauses or pursuant to the first paragraph hereof.

**_Asset Sales_**
The Parent Guarantor will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to,
directly or indirectly, consummate an Asset Sale unless:

(1) the Parent Guarantor (or the Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) receives
consideration at least equal to the Fair Market Value of the assets or Equity Interests issued
or sold or otherwise disposed of; and

(2) at least 75% of the consideration received in the Asset Sale by the Parent Guarantor or
such Restricted Subsidiary is in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents (including a
combination thereof). For purposes of this provision, each of the following will be deemed
to be cash:

(a) any liabilities, as recorded on the balance sheet (or the notes thereto) of the Parent
Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than contingent liabilities), that are
assumed by the transferee of any such assets and as a result of which the Parent
Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries are no longer obligated with respect to such
liabilities or are indemnified against further liabilities;

(b) any securities, notes or other obligations received by the Parent Guarantor or any such
Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted by the Parent Guarantor
or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents within 180 days following
the closing of the Asset Sale, to the extent of the cash or Cash Equivalents received in
that conversion;

(c) any Capital Stock or assets of the kind referred to in clauses (3) or (5) of the next
paragraph of this covenant;

(d) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a
result of such Asset Sale, to the extent that the Parent Guarantor and each other

212


-----

Restricted Subsidiary are released from any guarantee of such Indebtedness in
connection with such Asset Sale;

(e) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor received from
Persons who are not the Parent Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary that is
cancelled;

(f) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Parent Guarantor or any
Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset Sales having an aggregate Fair Market Value, when
taken together with all other Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to
this clause (f) that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of
e13.5 million and 15.0% of Consolidated EBITDA at the time of the receipt of such
Designated Non- Cash Consideration (with the Fair Market Value of each item of
Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without
giving effect to subsequent changes in value); and

(g) Replacement Assets.

Within 365 days after the receipt of any Net Available Cash from an Asset Sale, the Parent
Guarantor (or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) may apply such Net
Available Cash (at the option of the Parent Guarantor or Restricted Subsidiary):

(1) (i) prepay, repay, purchase or redeem any Indebtedness incurred under clause (1) of the
second paragraph of the covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on Indebtedness and
_Issuance of Preferred Stock;’’ provided, however, that, in connection with any prepayment,_
repayment, purchase or redemption of Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (1), the Parent
Guarantor or such Restricted Subsidiary will retire such Indebtedness and will cause the
related commitment (if any) (except in the case of any revolving Indebtedness (including,
for the avoidance of doubt, under the Revolving Credit Facility)) to be permanently
reduced in an amount equal to the principal amount so prepaid, repaid, purchase or
redeemed; (ii) unless included in the preceding clause (1)(i), prepay, repay, purchase or
redeem Notes or other Indebtedness that is not subordinated in right of payment to the
Notes and that is secured by security over the Collateral that ranks equal to security over
the Collateral securing the Notes (including Indebtedness that, pursuant to the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement has priority status in
respect of the proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral); or (iii) prepay, repay,
purchase or redeem any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor or
any Indebtedness that is secured by Liens on assets which do not constitute Collateral (in
each case other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor or
Indebtedness owed to the Parent Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary); provided that
the Parent Guarantor or Restricted Subsidiary shall prepay, repay, purchase or redeem
Indebtedness (other than the Notes) pursuant to sub-clause (ii) or (iii) only if the Issuer
makes (at such time or in compliance with this covenant) an offer to holders to purchase
their Notes in accordance with the provisions set forth below for an Asset Sale Offer for an
aggregate principal amount of Notes equal to the proportion that (x) the total aggregate
principal amount of Notes outstanding bears to (y) the sum total aggregate principal
amount of the Notes outstanding plus the total aggregate principal amount outstanding
of such Indebtedness (other than the Notes);

(2) (i) purchase Notes pursuant to an offer to all holders of the Notes or (ii) redeem the Notes
pursuant to the redemption provisions of the Indenture;

(3) to acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or any Capital Stock of, another
Permitted Business, if, after giving effect to any such acquisition of Capital Stock, the
Permitted Business is or becomes a Restricted Subsidiary;

(4) to make a capital expenditure or invest in any Replacement Assets;

213


-----

(5) to acquire other assets (other than Capital Stock) not classified as current assets under IFRS
that are used, useful in or related to a Permitted Business;

(6) consummate any combination of the foregoing; or

(7) enter into a binding commitment to apply the Net Available Cash pursuant to clause (1),
(2), (3), (4), (5) or (6) of this paragraph; provided that such binding commitment shall be
treated as a permitted application of the Net Available Cash from the date of such
commitment until the earlier of (x) the date on which such acquisition or expenditure is
consummated, and (y) the 180th day following the expiration of the aforementioned
365 day period.

Pending the final application of any Net Available Cash, the Parent Guarantor (or the
applicable Restricted Subsidiary) may temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or
otherwise invest the Net Available Cash in any manner that is not prohibited by the Indenture.
The Parent Guarantor (or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary) may elect to invest pursuant to
clauses (3), (4) or (5) of the above paragraph prior to receiving the Net Available Cash;
_provided that such investment will be made no earlier than the execution of a definitive_
agreement for the relevant Asset Sale.

Any Net Available Cash from Asset Sales that are not applied or invested as provided in the
second paragraph of this covenant will constitute ‘‘Excess Proceeds.’’ When the aggregate
amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds e25.0 million, within ten Business Days thereof, either the
Issuer or the Parent Guarantor will make an offer (an ‘‘Asset Sale Offer’’) to all holders of Notes
and may make an offer to all holders of other Indebtedness that is pari passu with the Notes
or any Note Guarantees and secured by security over the Collateral that ranks equal to the
security over the Collateral securing the Notes to purchase, prepay or redeem with the
proceeds of sales of assets to purchase, prepay or redeem the maximum principal amount of
Notes and such other pari passu Indebtedness (plus all accrued interest on the Indebtedness
and the amount of all fees and expenses, including premiums, incurred in connection
therewith) that may be purchased, prepaid or redeemed out of the Excess Proceeds and Midco
will prepay the Proceeds Loans to the extent necessary to finance the repurchase of the Notes
by the Issuer. The offer price for the Notes in any Asset Sale Offer will be equal to 100% of the
principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date
of purchase, prepayment or redemption, subject to the rights of holders of Notes on the
relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date, and will be
payable in cash. If any Excess Proceeds remain after an Asset Sale Offer, the Parent Guarantor
and its Restricted Subsidiaries may use those remaining Excess Proceeds for any purpose not
otherwise prohibited by the Indenture (including to fund (to the extent consistent with any
other applicable provision of the Indenture) any general corporate purpose (including but not
limited to the repurchase, repayment or other acquisition or retirement of any Subordinated
Indebtedness or the making of Restricted Payments)). If the aggregate principal amount of
Notes and other pari passu Indebtedness tendered into (or to be prepaid or redeemed in
connection with) such Asset Sale Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds or if the
aggregate principal amount of Notes tendered pursuant to a Notes Offer exceeds the amount
of the Net Available Cash so applied, the Notes and such other pari passu Indebtedness, if
applicable, will be purchased on a pro rata basis (or in the manner described under the caption
‘‘—Selection and Notice’’), based on the amounts tendered or required to be prepaid or
redeemed. Upon completion of each Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds will be
reset at zero.

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Notes is
denominated in a currency other than the currency in which the relevant Notes are
denominated, the amount thereof payable in respect of such Notes shall not exceed the net
amount of funds in the currency in which such Notes are denominated that is actually received
by the Parent Guarantor or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary upon converting such portion of
the Net Available Cash into such currency.

214


-----

The Issuer or the Parent Guarantor (as the case may be) will comply with the requirements of
Rule 14e-1 under the U.S. Exchange Act and any other applicable securities laws and
regulations to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with each
repurchase of Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer or a Notes Offer. To the extent that the
provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Asset Sale or Notes Offer
provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer or the Parent Guarantor will comply with the applicable
securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under
the Asset Sale or Notes Offer provisions of the Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

**_Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries_**
The Parent Guarantor will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to,
directly or indirectly, create or permit to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance
or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to:

(1) pay dividends or make any other distributions on its Capital Stock to the Parent Guarantor
or any Restricted Subsidiary, or with respect to any other interest or participation in, or

disadvantageous, taken as a whole, than those contained in the agreements governing the
Indebtedness being refinanced as determined in good faith by the Parent Guarantor or a
member of Senior Management thereof, or would not in the good faith determination of
the Parent Guarantor or a member of Senior Management thereof, materially impair the
ability of the Issuer to make payments on the Note;

have been satisfied and that the Indenture and the Notes constitute legal, valid and
binding obligations of the Parent Guarantor or the Person formed by or surviving any such
consolidation or merger (as applicable) enforceable in accordance with their terms
(provided that any such opinion of counsel may assume matters of fact, including as a
factual matter that one or more conditions precedent have occurred and include customary

Guarantor shall assume all of the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes, the Intercreditor
Agreement and the Security and Guarantee Documents to which the Issuer is a party, or (d) any
sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of assets among the Parent
Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries (including, without limitation, pursuant to an

The Parent Guarantor will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to,
make any payment to or sell, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its properties or
assets to, or purchase any property or assets from, or enter into or make or amend any
transaction, contract, agreement, understanding, loan, advance or guarantee for the benefit of
any Affiliate of the Parent Guarantor (each, an ‘‘Affiliate Transaction’’) involving aggregate
payments or consideration in excess of e7.5 million, unless:

(1) the Affiliate Transaction, taken as a whole, is on terms that are not materially less

would have been obtained in a comparable transaction by the Parent Guarantor or such
Restricted Subsidiary with an unrelated Person (as determined in good faith by the Parent
Guarantor or a member of Senior Management thereof); and

(2) with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions involving
aggregate consideration in excess of e20.0 million, the Parent Guarantor delivers to the

Guarantor or a member of Senior Management thereof);

(10) the entering into any agreement to pay and the payment of Management Advances

220


-----

(or a separate consolidated or combined tax return with its Restricted Subsidiaries that are
part of that consolidated or combined group);

Guarantors or the Issuer, directly or indirectly, to guarantee the payment of, assume or in any
manner become liable with respect to any other Indebtedness under Credit Facilities or Public
Debt of the Issuer or a Guarantor unless such Restricted Subsidiary simultaneously executes and
delivers a supplemental indenture providing for the Note Guarantee of the payment of the
Notes by such Restricted Subsidiary, which Note Guarantee will be senior to or pari passu with
such Restricted Subsidiary’s guarantee of such other Indebtedness.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Note Guarantee shall be required under
this covenant if such Note Guarantee (in the good faith determination of the Parent Guarantor
or a member of Senior Management thereof) could reasonably be expected to give rise to or
result in:

- any violation (or any material risk of any such violation) of applicable law that cannot be
avoided or otherwise prevented through measures reasonably available to the Parent
Guarantor (including any reasonably available ‘‘whitewash’’ procedures or similar procedures
that would be required in order to enable such Note Guarantee to be provided in
accordance with applicable law);

liability) for any of the officers, directors or shareholders of the Parent Guarantor, any
Subsidiary thereof (including such Restricted Subsidiary) or any parent company; or

obligation to pay any Additional Amount) other than (i) reasonable, routine and immaterial

221


-----

out-of-pocket expenses; and (ii) reasonable expenses incurred in connection with (x) any
governmental or regulatory filings required as a result of such Note Guarantee or (y) any
‘‘whitewash’’ procedures (or similar procedures that would be required in order to enable
such Note Guarantee to be provided in accordance with applicable law) undertaken in
connection with such Note Guarantee, which cannot be avoided through measures
reasonably available to the Parent Guarantor or the Restricted Subsidiary.

Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Indenture, each Note Guarantee shall be in such
form and substance, and subject to such terms, conditions, limitations, qualifications and
restrictions as may be necessary or appropriate (in the good faith determination of the Parent
Guarantor or a member of Senior Management thereof) by reason of or to comply with any
applicable law, rule or regulation, including the law of any jurisdiction where the relevant
Guarantor is organized or conducts business, or as necessary to recognize certain defenses
generally available to guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or
transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, thin capitalization,
distributable reserves, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the
rights of creditors generally or otherwise relating to the insolvency of debtors).

Each Note Guarantee shall be released in accordance with the provisions described under the
caption ‘‘—Notes Guarantee Release.’’ Upon any such occurrence, the Trustee shall execute any
documents reasonably requested in order to evidence such release, discharge and termination
in respect of the applicable Note Guarantee.

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**
The Parent Guarantor will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to,
take or knowingly or negligently omit to take, any action that would have the result of
materially impairing the security interest with respect to the Collateral (it being understood
that the incurrence of Liens on the Collateral permitted by the definition of Permitted
Collateral Liens shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the security
interest with respect to the Collateral) for the benefit of the Trustee and the holders of the
Notes; and the Parent Guarantor will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries to, grant to any Person other than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the
Trustee and the holders of the Notes and the other beneficiaries described in the Security and
Guarantee Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, any interest whatsoever in any of the Collateral; provided that (a) nothing in this
provision will restrict the discharge or release of the Collateral in accordance with the
Indenture, the Security and Guarantee Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and (b) the Parent Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries
may incur Permitted Collateral Liens; and provided further, that no Collateral Documents may
be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified, replaced or
released other than as provided in the previous clauses (a) and (b), unless contemporaneously
with such amendment, renewal, replacement, restatement, supplement, modification, extension
or release, the Parent Guarantor delivers to the Trustee one of the following: (1) a solvency
opinion from an internationally recognized investment bank or accounting firm, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee confirming the solvency of the Parent
Guarantor and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to any transactions related
to such amendment, extension, renewal, supplement, modification, replacement or release,
(2) a certificate from the board of directors or chief financial officer of the Parent Guarantor
(acting in good faith), in the form set forth as an exhibit to the Indenture, that confirms the
solvency of the Person granting such Lien after giving effect to any transaction related to such
amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification, replacement or
release or (3) an opinion of counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Trustee (subject to customary exceptions, qualifications and assumptions), confirming that, after
giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement, modification or replacement, the Lien or Liens securing the Notes created under

222


-----

the Security and Guarantee Documents so amended, extended, renewed, restated,
supplemented, modified, replaced or released and retaken are valid and perfected Liens not
otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law,
and that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such
amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification, replacement or
release.

At the direction of the Issuer and without the consent of the holder of Notes, the Security
Agent may from time to time enter into one or more amendments to the Security and
Guarantee Documents to: (i) cure any ambiguity, mistake, omission, defect or inconsistency
therein, (ii) subject to compliance with the first paragraph of this covenants, provide for
Permitted Collateral Liens, (iii) comply with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (iv) add to the Collateral, (v) evidence the succession of
another Person to the Issuer or any Guarantor and the assumption by such successor of the
obligations under the Indenture, the Notes and the Security and Guarantee Documents, in each
case, including in accordance with the caption ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or
_Sale of Assets,’’ (vi) provide for the release of property and assets constituting Collateral from_
the Lien of the Security and Guarantee Documents and/or the release of the Note Guarantee of
a Guarantor, in each case, in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant Security and Guarantee
Documents, in each case, (vii) conform the Security and Guarantee Documents to this
‘‘Description of Notes,’’ (viii) to evidence and provide for the acceptance of the appointment of
a successor Trustee or Security Agent or (ix) make any other change thereto that does not
adversely affect rights of the holders of the Notes in any material respect.

In the event that the Issuer complies with this covenant, the Trustee and the Security Agent
will (subject to customary protections and indemnifications) consent to such amendment,
extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement with no need for
instructions from holders of the Notes.

**_Collateral_**
The Parent Guarantor will, and will procure that each of its Restricted Subsidiaries will, at its
own expense, execute and do all such acts and things and provide such assurances as the
Security Agent (if applicable) may reasonably require (1) for registering any Security and
Guarantee Documents in any required register and for perfecting or protecting the security
intended to be afforded by such Security and Guarantee Documents; and (2) if such Security
and Guarantee Documents have become enforceable, for facilitating the realization of all or
any part of the assets which are subject to such Security and Guarantee Documents and for
facilitating the exercise of all powers, authorities and discretions vested in the Security Agent
or in any receiver of all or any part of those assets. The Parent Guarantor will, and will procure
that each of its Restricted Subsidiaries will, execute all transfers, conveyances, assignments and
releases of that property whether to the Security Agent or to its nominees and give all notices,
orders and directions which the Security Agent may reasonably request, in each case, as
applicable.

**_Limitation on Issuer Activities_**
The Issuer will not engage in any business activity except any activity (a) reasonably relating to
the offering, sale, issuance, incurrence and servicing, purchase, redemption, amendment,
exchange, refinancing or retirement of the Notes (including Additional Notes), the incurrence
of Indebtedness represented by the Notes or other Indebtedness of the Issuer permitted by the
Indenture (including any Indebtedness incurred in the future and the making of any
guarantee) and distributing, lending or otherwise advancing the proceeds thereof to the
Parent Guarantor or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, including making Investments pursuant
to the Proceeds Loans or any Additional Proceeds Loan with the proceeds thereof permitted by
the Indenture (including the lending of the proceeds from the incurrence of such Indebtedness

223


-----

and the receipt of interest thereon), (b) undertaken with the purpose of, related or ancillary
to, or otherwise incidental or resulting from the incurrence of such Indebtedness or the making
of such Investments; including any obligations under the Security and Guarantee Documents,
the Proceeds Loans, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
and any repurchase, purchase, repayment, redemption, refinancing or prepayment of, or any
consent or amendment with respect to, such Indebtedness, (c) undertaken with the purpose of,
related or ancillary to or otherwise incidental or resulting from the establishment and
maintenance of the Issuer’s corporate existence, (d) other activities that are not material or de
_minimis in nature (as compared to the consolidated business activities of the Parent Guarantor_
and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole) or otherwise could not reasonably be expected
to result in an Event of Default pursuant to clause (8) of the definition thereof, (e) relating to
the granting of Permitted Liens and Permitted Collateral Liens if the granting of such Liens was
otherwise permitted by the Indenture, (f) involving the provision of administrative or other
related services, (g) related to any purchase agreement, and/or any document entered into in
connection with the issuance of the Notes or any other Indebtedness or other activity or action
permitted under the Indenture; (h) related to or in connection with the Offering and the
Redemption or as otherwise described in the Offering Memorandum; or (i) reasonably related
to any or a combination of the foregoing. The Issuer shall not (a) issue any Capital Stock (other
than as permitted by the covenant under the caption ‘‘—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of
_Assets’’ or the issuance of directors’ qualifying shares and other nominal amounts of Capital_
Stock that are required to be held by other Persons under applicable law) or (y) undertake any
transaction that will require the Issuer to register as an ‘‘investment company’’ or an entity
‘‘controlled by an investment company’’ as defined in the U.S. Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder.

The Issuer and Midco will not (i) sell, dispose, encumber, prepay, repay, repurchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire, reduce or retire any amounts outstanding under the Proceeds Loans except
(a) in connection with a redemption of outstanding Notes in a manner permitted by the
Indenture, (b) in connection with the making of a Permitted Collateral Lien, (c) as provided for
in the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Security
Documents or as provided under the caption ‘‘—Security—Release of Liens’’ and (d) in
connection with a transaction permitted by the covenant described under the caption ‘‘—
_Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets’’ or (ii) amend, modify, supplement or waive any rights_
under the Proceeds Loans in a manner that would adversely affect in any material respect the
rights of the Issuer or its creditors with respect to the Proceeds Loans.

**_Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries_**
The Board of Directors of the Parent Guarantor may designate any Restricted Subsidiary to be
an Unrestricted Subsidiary if that designation would not cause a Default. If a Restricted
Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the aggregate Fair Market Value of all
outstanding Investments owned by the Parent Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries in the
Subsidiary designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be deemed to be an Investment made
as of the time of the designation and will reduce the amount available for Restricted Payments
under the covenant described under the caption ‘‘—Restricted Payments’’ or under one or more
clauses of the definition of Permitted Investments, as determined by the Parent Guarantor.
That designation will only be permitted if the Investment would be permitted at that time and
if the Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary. The
Parent Guarantor may redesignate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary if
that redesignation would not cause a Default.

Any designation of a Subsidiary of the Parent Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be
evidenced to the Trustee by filing with the Trustee a copy of a resolution of the Parent
Guarantor’s Board of Directors giving effect to such designation and an Officer’s Certificate
certifying that such designation complies with the preceding conditions and was permitted by
the covenant described under the caption ‘‘—Restricted Payments.’’ If, at any time, any

224


-----

Unrestricted Subsidiary would fail to meet the preceding requirements as an Unrestricted
Subsidiary, it will thereafter cease to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary for purposes of the
Indenture and any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary will be deemed to be incurred by a
Restricted Subsidiary as of such date and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be incurred
as of such date under the covenant described under the caption ‘‘—Incurrence of Indebtedness
_and Issuance of Preferred Stock,’’ the Parent Guarantor will be in default of such covenant. The_
Board of Directors of the Parent Guarantor may at any time designate any Unrestricted
Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary; provided that such designation will be deemed to be
an incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary of any outstanding Indebtedness of
such Unrestricted Subsidiary, and such designation will only be permitted if (1) such
Indebtedness is permitted under the covenant described under the caption ‘‘—Incurrence of
_Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock,’’ calculated on a pro forma basis as if such_
designation had occurred at the beginning of the applicable reference period; and (2) no
Default or Event of Default would be in existence following such designation.

**_Maintenance of Listing_**
The Issuer will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain the listing of the
Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the admission to trading on
the Euro MTF market for so long as such Notes are outstanding; provided that if the Issuer is
unable to obtain such listing and admission to trading or if at any time the Issuer determines
that it will not maintain such listing, it will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
and maintain a listing of such Notes on another ‘‘recognised stock exchange’’ as defined in
Section 1005 of the Income Tax Act 2007 of the United Kingdom. In no event will this covenant
require the Issuer to obtain or maintain the listing of the Notes on any exchange that requires
financial reporting for any fiscal period in addition to the fiscal periods required by the
covenant described under the caption ‘‘—Reports.’’

**_Reports_**
For so long as any Notes are outstanding, the Parent Guarantor will furnish to the Trustee the
following reports:

(1) within 120 days after the end of each of the Parent Guarantor’s fiscal years, annual reports
containing the following information: (a) audited consolidated balance sheet of the Parent
Guarantor as of the end of the two most recent fiscal years and audited consolidated
income statements and statements of cash flow of the Parent Guarantor for the two most
recent fiscal years, including footnotes to such financial statements and the report of the
independent auditors on the financial statements; (b) pro forma income statement and
balance sheet information of the Parent Guarantor (which need not comply with Article 11
of Regulation S-X under the U.S. Exchange Act), together with explanatory footnotes, for
any material acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred since the
beginning of the most recently completed fiscal year as to which such annual report relates
(unless such pro forma information has been provided in a previous report pursuant to
clauses (2) or (3) below), provided that such pro forma financial information will be
provided only to the extent available without unreasonable expense, in which case, the
Parent Guarantor will provide, in the case of a material acquisition, acquired company
financials to the extent reasonably available; (c) to the extent relating to annual periods,
an operating and financial review of the audited financial statements, including a
discussion of the results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and capital resources,
and a discussion of material commitments and contingencies and critical accounting
policies; (d) a description of the business, senior management and principal shareholders of
the Parent Guarantor, material affiliate transactions and material debt instruments; and
(e) material risk factors and material recent developments (to the extent not previously
reported pursuant to clause (2) or (3) below); provided that the information described in
clauses (d) and (e) may be provided in the footnotes to the audited financial statements;

225


-----

(2) within 60 days following the end of each of the first three fiscal quarters in each fiscal
year of the Parent Guarantor, quarterly reports containing the following information:
(a) an unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of the end of such fiscal quarter
and unaudited condensed statements of income and cash flow for the year to date periods
ending on the unaudited condensed balance sheet date, and the comparable prior year
periods for the Parent Guarantor, together with condensed footnote disclosure; (b) pro
_forma income statement and balance sheet information of the Parent Guarantor (or any_
predecessor entity) (which need not comply with Article 11 of Regulation S-X under the
U.S. Exchange Act), together with explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions,
dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of the most
recently completed fiscal quarter as to which such quarterly report relates (unless such pro
_forma information has been provided in a previous report pursuant to clauses (1) above or_
(3) below), provided that such pro forma financial information will be provided only to the
extent available without unreasonable expense, in which case, the Parent Guarantor will
provide, in the case of a material acquisition, acquired company financials to the extent
reasonably available; (c) a summary operating and financial review of the unaudited
financial statements, including a summary discussion of the consolidated financial condition
and results of operations of the Parent Guarantor and any material change between the
current fiscal quarter and the corresponding period of the prior year; and (d) material
recent developments (to the extent not previously reported pursuant to clauses (1) above
or (3) below), provided that the information described in clause (d) may be provided in the
footnotes to the audited financial statements; and

(3) promptly after the occurrence of any material acquisition, disposition or restructuring of
the Parent Guarantor and the Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or any changes of
the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer at the Parent Guarantor or change in
auditors of the Parent Guarantor or any other material event that the Parent Guarantor
announces publicly, a report containing a description of such event,

_provided, however, that the reports set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above will not be_
required to (i) contain any reconciliation to U.S. GAAP and (ii) include separate financial
statements for the Issuer, any Guarantor or non-guarantor Subsidiaries of the Parent Guarantor.

In addition, if the Parent Guarantor has designated any of its Subsidiaries as Unrestricted
Subsidiaries and such Subsidiaries are Significant Subsidiaries, then the quarterly and annual
financial information required by the preceding paragraph will include a reasonably detailed
presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, of the
financial condition and results of operations of the Parent Guarantor and the Restricted
Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted
Subsidiaries of the Parent Guarantor.

All financial statement information shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS as in effect on
the date of such report or financial statement (or otherwise on the basis of IFRS as then in
effect) and on a consistent basis for the periods presented, except as may otherwise be
described in such information; provided, however, that the reports set forth in clauses (1),
(2) and (3) above may, in the event of a change in IFRS, present earlier periods on a basis that
applied to such periods. Except as provided above, no report need include separate financial
statements for any Subsidiaries of the Parent Guarantor or any disclosure with respect to the
results of operations or any other financial or statistical disclosure not of a type included in this
Offering Memorandum.

For purposes of this covenant, an acquisition or disposition shall be deemed to be material if
the entity or business acquired or disposed of represents greater than 20% of the Parent
Guarantor’s (a) total revenue or Consolidated EBITDA for the most recent four quarters for
which annual or quarterly financial reports have been delivered to the Trustee or
(b) consolidated assets as of the last day of the most recent quarter for which annual or

226


-----

quarterly financial reports have been delivered to the Trustee. In addition, for so long as any
Notes remain outstanding, the Issuer has agreed that it will furnish to the holders and to
securities analysts and prospective investors, upon their request, the information required to be
delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the U.S. Securities Act.

Contemporaneously with the furnishing of each such report discussed above, the Issuer will
post such report on a publicly accessible website maintained by the Parent Guarantor or any of
its Affiliates for such purpose.

If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange
and admitted for trading on the Euro MTF market and the rules of that exchange will so
require, the above information will also be made available through the office of the Registrar
and the registered office of the Issuer.

In the event that (i) the Parent Guarantor becomes subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the U.S. Exchange Act, or elects to comply with such provisions, for so
long as it continues to file the reports required by Section 13(a) with the SEC or (ii) the Parent
Guarantor elects to provide to the Trustee reports which, if filed with the SEC, would satisfy (in
the good faith judgment of the Parent Guarantor or a member of Senior Management
thereof) the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the U.S. Exchange Act (other
than the provision of U.S. GAAP information, certifications, exhibits or information as to
internal controls and procedures), for so long as it elects, the Parent Guarantor will make
available to the Trustee such annual reports, information, documents and other reports that
the Issuer is, or would be, required to file with the SEC pursuant to such Section 13(a) or 15(d)
of the U.S. Exchange Act.

The Parent Guarantor may comply with any requirement to provide reports or financial
statements required by this covenant by providing any report or financial statement of a direct
or indirect parent of the Parent Guarantor so long as the Parent Guarantor is a wholly owned
subsidiary of such parent and such parent provides a Guarantee of the Notes; provided that, if
the financial statements of a parent are included in such report, a reasonably detailed
description of material differences between the consolidated financial statements of such
parent and the Parent Guarantor shall be provided.

Upon complying with the foregoing requirement, the Parent Guarantor will be deemed to
have complied with the provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs.

**_Suspension of Certain Covenants when Notes Rated Investment Grade_**
If on any date following the Issue Date:

(1) the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status; and

(2) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and is continuing on such date,

then, beginning on that day and continuing until such time, if any, at which the Notes cease to
have Investment Grade Status (such period, the ‘‘Suspension Period’’), the covenants set forth
under the following captions in this ‘‘Description of Notes’’ will no longer be applicable to the
Notes and any related default provisions of the Indenture will cease to be effective and will
not be applicable to the Parent Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries:

(1) ‘‘—Asset Sales;’’

(2) ‘‘—Restricted Payments;’’

(3) ‘‘—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock;’’

(4) ‘‘—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries;’’

(5) ‘‘—Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries;’’

227


-----

(6) ‘‘—Transactions with Affiliates;’’

(7) ‘‘—Additional Guarantees;’’

(8) ‘‘—Impairment of Security Interest;’’ and

(9) clause (4) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under the caption ‘‘—Merger,
_Consolidation or Sale of Assets.’’_

Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with regard to the actions of the Parent
Guarantor and the Restricted Subsidiaries properly taken during the continuance of the
Suspension Period; provided that (1) with respect to the Restricted Payments made after any
such reinstatement, the amount of Restricted Payments will be calculated as though the
covenant described under the caption ‘‘—Restricted Payments’’ had been in effect prior to, but
not during, the Suspension Period and (2) all Indebtedness incurred, or Disqualified Stock or
preferred stock issued, during the Suspension Period will be classified to have been incurred or
issued pursuant to clause (2) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under the
caption ‘‘—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock.’’ Upon the occurrence
of a Suspension Period, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero. In addition, the
Indenture will also permit, without causing a Default or Event of Default, the Parent Guarantor
or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to honor any contractual commitments or take actions in
the future after any date on which the Notes cease to have an Investment Grade Status as long
as the contractual commitments were entered into during the Suspension Period and not in
anticipation of the Notes no longer having an Investment Grade Status. The Parent Guarantor
or the Issuer shall notify the Trustee that the conditions set forth in the first paragraph under
this caption has been satisfied, provided that, no such notification shall be a condition for the
suspension of the covenants described under this covenant to be effective. The Trustee shall
not be obligated to notify holders of such event.

There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain an Investment Grade
Status.

**_Financial Calculations in Respect of Transactions_**
When determining the availability under any basket or ratio under the Indenture in connection
with any transaction or whether such transaction is permitted under the Indenture (including,
for the avoidance of doubt and without limitation, testing any incurrence or assumption of
Indebtedness or Liens, the making of any Restricted Payment, Permitted Payment or
Investment, any Asset Sale, any acquisition, merger, consolidation, amalgamation or other
business combination and any other transaction requiring the testing of any basket based on
the Consolidated EBITDA of the Parent Guarantor), the date of determination of such basket or
ratio or the testing of any such transaction and of any Default or Event of Default shall, at the
option of the Issuer, be the date the definitive agreements for such transaction are entered
into (the ‘‘Transaction Commitment Date Election’’).

If the Issuer makes a Transaction Commitment Date Election, such baskets or ratios shall be
calculated with such pro forma adjustments as are appropriate and consistent with the pro
_forma provisions set forth in the definition of Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio and Consolidated_
Net Leverage Ratio after giving effect to such transaction and other transactions to be entered
into in connection therewith (including any incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds
thereof) as if they had occurred at the beginning of the applicable period for purposes of
determining the ability to consummate any such transaction, and, for the avoidance of doubt
(x) if any of such baskets or ratios are exceeded as a result of fluctuations in such basket or
ratio (including due to fluctuations in the Consolidated Net Income or Consolidated EBITDA of
the Parent Guarantor or that arises from an asset or a target company subject to such
transaction) subsequent to such date of determination and at or prior to the consummation of
the relevant transaction, such baskets or ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded as a

228


-----

result of such fluctuations solely for purposes of determining whether the transaction is
permitted hereunder and (y) such baskets or ratios shall not be tested at the time of
consummation of such transaction or related transactions.

If the Issuer makes a Transaction Commitment Date Election, any such transactions (including
any incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds therefrom) shall be deemed to have
occurred on the date the definitive agreements are entered into for purposes of calculating
any baskets or ratios under the Indenture after the date of such agreement and before the
consummation of such transaction. To the extent the date of determination of a basket or ratio
is tested prior to the date of consummation of a transaction, such basket or ratio shall be
deemed utilized to the same extent until the earlier of the date of consummation of such
transaction or the date such transaction is terminated or expires without consummation, except
that, in the case of an acquisition, merger or consolidation, any calculation of Consolidated
EBITDA for purposes other than incurrences of Indebtedness or Liens or the making of
Restricted Payments (related to such acquisition, merger or consolidation) shall not reflect such
transaction until it has been consummated.

## Additional or Amended Intercreditor Agreement

The Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Issuer or the Parent Guarantor, at the
time of, or prior to, the incurrence by the Issuer or any Guarantor of Indebtedness permitted
pursuant to (x) the first paragraph of the covenant described under the caption ‘‘—Certain
_Covenants—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock’’ or clauses (1), (4), (8),_
(13), (17) and (18) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under the caption
_‘‘—Certain Covenants—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock’’ and (y) any_
Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of Indebtedness referred to in the foregoing
clause (x) as well as clause (3) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under the
caption ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock,’’ the
Issuer, the relevant Guarantors, the Trustee and the Security Agent will (without the consent of
the holders of the Notes) enter into an additional intercreditor agreement (each an ‘‘Additional
_Intercreditor Agreement’’) on terms substantially similar to the Intercreditor Agreement (or not_
materially less favorable to the holders of the Notes taken as a whole) or an amendment to or
an amendment and restatement or other modification of the Intercreditor Agreement (which
amendment does not adversely affect the rights of holder of the Notes in any material
respect); provided that such Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement will
not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or the Security Agent or adversely affect
the rights, duties, liabilities, indemnifications or immunities of the Trustee or the Security Agent
under the Indenture, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Intercreditor Agreement
without the consent of the Trustee or Security Agent.

The Indenture also will provide that, at the direction of the Parent Guarantor and without the
consent of holders of the Notes, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall from time to time
enter into one or more amendments to any Intercreditor Agreement to: (1) cure any ambiguity,
omission, error, defect or inconsistency of any such agreement, (2) increase the amount or types
of Indebtedness covered by any such agreement that may be incurred by the Parent Guarantor
or a Restricted Subsidiary that is subject to any such agreement (including with respect to any
Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the addition of provisions
relating to new Indebtedness ranking junior in right of payment to the Notes), (3) add
Restricted Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, (4) further secure the Notes (including Additional Notes), (5) make provision for
equal and ratable pledges of the Collateral to secure Additional Notes, (6) implement any
Permitted Collateral Liens, (7) amend the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof or (8) make any other change to
any such agreement that does not adversely affect the holders of the Notes in any material
respect. The Parent Guarantor shall not otherwise direct the Trustee or the Security Agent to

229


-----

enter into any amendment to any Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of the holders
of the Notes of the majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding,
except as otherwise permitted below under the caption ‘‘—Amendment, Supplement and
_Waiver,’’ and the Parent Guarantor may only direct the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter_
into any amendment to the extent such amendment does not impose any personal obligations
on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, adversely
affect their respective rights, duties, liabilities, indemnifications or immunities under the
Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement without
the consent of the Trustee or Security Agent.

The Indenture shall also provide that, in relation to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee (and Security Agent, if applicable) shall consent on behalf
of the holders of the Notes to the payment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance,
acquisition, retirement or redemption of any obligations subordinated to the Notes thereby;
_provided, that such transaction would comply with the covenant described under the caption_
‘‘—Certain Covenants—Restricted Payments.’’

The Indenture will provide that each holder of a Note, by accepting such Note, will be deemed
to have agreed to, accepted the terms and conditions of, and to have directed the Trustee and
the Security Agent to enter into, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement and any amendment, restatement or other modification referred to in the
preceding paragraph (whether then entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to the
provisions described herein) and the Trustee or the Security Agent will not be required to seek
the consent of any holders of Notes to perform its obligations under and in accordance with
this covenant.

## Events of Default and Remedies

Each of the following is an ‘‘Event of Default’’ under the Indenture:

(1) default for 30 continuous days in the payment when due of interest or Additional
Amounts, if any, with respect to the Notes;

(2) default in the payment when due (at maturity, upon redemption or otherwise) of the
principal of, or premium, if any, on, the Notes;

(3) failure by the Issuer or relevant Guarantor for 60 continuous days after written notice (i) to
the Issuer by the Trustee or (ii) to the Issuer and the Trustee by the holders of at least 30%
in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding voting as a single class to
comply with any of the agreements in the Indenture (other than a default in performance,
or breach, or a covenant or agreement which is specifically dealt with in clauses (1) or (2));

(4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or
by which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the
Parent Guarantor or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is
guaranteed by the Parent Guarantor or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries), whether such
Indebtedness or guarantee now exists, or is created after the Issue Date, if that default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal when due of such Indebtedness immediately
upon the expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness (a ‘‘Payment
_Default’’); or_

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its express maturity,

and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the
principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a
Payment Default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates
e25.0 million or more;

230


-----

(5) failure by the Parent Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Significant Subsidiary
or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a Significant
Subsidiary, to pay final judgments entered by a court or courts of competent jurisdiction
aggregating in excess of e25.0 million (exclusive of any amounts that an insurance
company has acknowledged liability for), which judgments shall not have been discharged
or waived and there shall have been a period of 60 consecutive days during which a stay
of enforcement of such judgment or order, by reason of an appeal, waiver or otherwise,
shall not have been in effect;

(6) except as permitted by the Indenture (including with respect to any limitations), any Note
Guarantee of a Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary or any group of Guarantors that,
taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary is held in any judicial proceeding
to be unenforceable or invalid or ceases for any reason to be in full force and effect, or
any Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary or any group of Guarantors that, taken
together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary, or any Person acting on behalf of any
such Guarantor or Guarantors, denies or disaffirms its obligations under its Note Guarantee
and such Default continues for 60 consecutive days;

(7) (a) any security interest over Collateral with a Fair Market Value greater than e7.5 million
created by any Security and Guarantee Document ceases to be in full force and effect
(except as permitted by the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and the
Security and Guarantee Documents) or any assertion by Holdco, the Parent Guarantor or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that any such Collateral is not subject to a valid, perfected
security interest (except as permitted by the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor
Agreement and the Security and Guarantee Documents); provided that, there is a material
and adverse effect on the interest of the holders of Notes or (b) the repudiation by
Holdco, the Parent Guarantor or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of any of its material
obligations under any Security and Guarantee Document affecting Collateral with a Fair
Market Value greater than e7.5 million, and in either the case of (a) or (b) such Default
continues for 60 consecutive days; and

(8) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency described in the Indenture with respect to
Holdco, the Parent Guarantor or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that is a Significant
Subsidiary or any group of its Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute
a Significant Subsidiary.

In the case of an Event of Default arising from certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency, with
respect to the Issuer or any Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary or any group of
Guarantors that, taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary, all outstanding
Notes will become due and payable immediately without further action or notice or other act
on the part of the Trustee or any holders of Notes. If any other Event of Default occurs and is
continuing and subject to the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee or the holders of at least 30% in aggregate
principal amount of the then outstanding Notes by written notice to the Issuer (and to the
Trustee if such notice is given by the holders) may and the Trustee, upon the written request of
such holders, shall declare all amounts in respect of the Notes to be due and payable
immediately.

Subject to certain limitations and subject to the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, holders of a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any
trust or power. The Trustee may withhold from holders of the Notes notice of any continuing
Default or Event of Default if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest, except a
Default or Event of Default relating to the payment of principal, interest or Additional
Amounts or premium, if any.

231


-----

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, in case an
Event of Default occurs and is continuing of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has
written notice of, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or
powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any holders of Notes unless such
holders have offered (and if accepted, provided) to the Trustee indemnity and/or security
satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense. Except (subject to the provisions
described under the caption ‘‘—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver’’) to enforce the right to
receive payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest or Additional Amounts when due,
and subject to the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, no holder of a Note may pursue any remedy with respect to the
Indenture or the Notes unless:

(1) such holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have
requested, in writing, that the Trustee pursue the remedy;

(3) such holders have offered the Trustee security and/or indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee
against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the
request and the offer of security and/or indemnity; and

(5) holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have
not given the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.

The holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding
may, on behalf of the holders of all outstanding Notes, waive any past default under the
Indenture and its consequences, except a continuing default in the payment of the principal of
premium, if any, any Additional Amounts or interest on any Note held by a non-consenting
holder (which may only be waived with the consent of each holder of Notes affected).

The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal
year, an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default or
Event of Default that occurred during the previous fiscal year. The Issuer is required to deliver
to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of
which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the
Parent Guarantor and/or the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.

The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a report or a
required certificate in connection with another default (an ‘‘Initial Default’’), then at the time
such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate
in connection with the Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any
Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the
covenant described under the caption ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Reports’’ or otherwise to deliver
any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to
be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or notice or
certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period
specified in the Indenture.

## No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Stockholders

No director, manager, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder of the Issuer, any
Guarantor or any of their shareholders or Affiliates, as such, will have any liability for any
obligations of the Issuer or the Guarantors under the Notes, the Indenture and the Note
Guarantees or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their
creation. Each holder of Notes by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The

232


-----

waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. The waiver may not
be effective to waive liabilities under applicable securities laws.

## Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance

The Issuer may at any time, at the option of its Board of Directors evidenced by a resolution
set forth in an Officer’s Certificate, elect to have all of its obligations discharged with respect
to the outstanding Notes and all obligations of the Guarantors discharged with respect to their
Note Guarantees (‘‘Legal Defeasance’’) except for:

(1) the rights of holders of outstanding Notes to receive payments in respect of the principal
of, or interest (including Additional Amounts) or premium, if any, on, such Notes when
such payments are due from the trust referred to below;

(2) the Issuer’s obligations with respect to the Notes concerning issuing temporary Notes,
registration of Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an
office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust;

(3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee, and the Issuer’s and the
Guarantors’ obligations in connection therewith; and

(4) the Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance provisions of the Indenture.

In addition, the Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have the obligations of the
Issuer and the Guarantors released with respect to certain covenants (including its obligation to
make Change of Control Offers and Asset Sale Offers) that are described in the Indenture
(‘‘Covenant Defeasance’’) and thereafter any omission to comply with those covenants will not
constitute a Default or Event of Default with respect to the Notes. In the event Covenant
Defeasance occurs, all Events of Default described under the caption ‘‘—Events of Default and
_Remedies’’ (except those relating to payments on the Notes or, solely with respect to the Issuer,_
bankruptcy or insolvency events) will no longer constitute an Event of Default with respect to
the Notes.

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance:

(1) the Issuer must irrevocably deposit with the Trustee (or such other entity designated or
appointed (as agent) by it for such purpose), in trust, for the benefit of the holders of the
Notes, cash in euro, European Government Obligations or a combination of cash in euro
and European Government Obligations, in amounts as will be sufficient, in the opinion of
a nationally recognized investment bank, appraisal firm or firm of independent public
accountants, to pay the principal of, or interest (including Additional Amounts and
premium, if any) on the outstanding Notes on the stated date for payment thereof or on
the applicable redemption date, as the case may be, and the Issuer must specify whether
the Notes are being defeased to such stated date for payment or to a particular
redemption date;

(2) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an opinion of United
States counsel confirming that (a) the Issuer has received from, or there has been published
by, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service a ruling or (b) since the Issue Date, there has been a
change in the applicable U.S. federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and
based thereon such opinion of counsel will confirm that, the holders of the outstanding
Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a
result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to tax on the same amounts, in the
same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance
had not occurred;

(3) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an opinion of
United States counsel confirming that the holders of the outstanding Notes will not

233


-----

recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such
Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts,
in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Covenant
Defeasance had not occurred;

(4) the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was
not made by the Issuer with the intent of preferring the holders of Notes over the other
creditors of the Issuer or the Guarantors with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying
or defrauding any creditors of the Issuer, the Guarantors or others; and

(5) the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an opinion of counsel,
subject to customary assumptions and qualifications, each stating that all conditions
precedent relating to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant Defeasance have been
complied with.

## Amendment, Supplement and Waiver

Except as provided otherwise in the succeeding paragraphs, the Indenture, the Notes, the Note
Guarantees, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the
Security and Guarantee Documents may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the
holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding
(including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender
offer or exchange offer for, Notes), and any existing Default or Event of Default or compliance
with any provision of the Indenture, the Notes, the Note Guarantees, the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or any Security and Guarantee Documents
may be waived with the consent of the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of
the then outstanding Notes (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection
with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes).

If any amendment, supplement or waiver to the Indenture, the Notes, the Note Guarantees or
the Security and Guarantee Documents will only affect the Fixed Rate Notes or the Floating
Rate Notes, only the holders of a majority (or super majority, as the case may be) in aggregate
principal amount of the then outstanding Fixed Rate Notes or Floating Rate Notes (and not the
consent of the holders of the majority (or super majority, as the case may be) of all of the
Notes), as the case may be, shall be required. Notwithstanding the foregoing and for the
avoidance of doubt, it is understood and agreed that (a) any matter described in clause (1), (2),
(3), (5) and (6) in the next succeeding paragraph that by its terms applies to the Fixed Rate
Notes shall require the consent of 90% of the holders of the Fixed Rate Notes in order for it to
be binding on all holders of the Fixed Rate Notes and (b) any matter described in clause (1),
(2), (3), (5) and (6) in the next succeeding paragraph that by its terms applies to the Floating
Rate Notes shall require the consent of 90% of the holders of the Floating Rate Notes in order
for it to be binding on all holders of the Floating Rate Notes.

Unless consented to by the holders of at least 90% (or, in the case of clause (8) below, 75%) of
the aggregate principal amount of then outstanding Notes (including, without limitation,
consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for,
Notes), without the consent of each holder of Notes affected, an amendment, supplement or
waiver may not (with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting holder):

(1) reduce the principal of or change the fixed maturity of any Note or alter the provisions
with respect to the redemption of the Notes (other than provisions relating to the
covenants described under the caption ‘‘—Repurchase at the Option of Holders’’);

(2) reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest, including default interest,
on any Note;

234


-----

(3) impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with respect to
such holder’s Notes or any guarantee in respect thereof;

(4) waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of, or interest, Additional
Amounts or premium, if any, on, the Notes (except a rescission of acceleration of the Notes
by the holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then
outstanding Notes and a waiver of the Payment Default that resulted from such
acceleration);

(5) make any Note payable in money other than that stated in the Notes (except to the extent
the currency stated in the Notes has been superseded or replaced pursuant to applicable
law);

(6) waive a redemption payment with respect to any Note (other than a payment required by
one of the covenants described under the caption ‘‘—Repurchase at the Option of
_Holders’’);_

(7) release the Parent Guarantor or release any Subsidiary Guarantor that is a Significant
Subsidiary or any group of Subsidiary Guarantors that, taken together, would constitute a
Significant Subsidiary from any of their obligations under their Note Guarantees or the
Indenture, except in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor
Agreement;

(8) release all or substantially all of the Liens on the Collateral granted for the benefit of the
holders of Notes, except in accordance with the terms of the relevant Security and
Guarantee Documents, the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement; or

(9) make any change in the preceding amendment and waiver provisions.

For the avoidance of doubt, no amendment to or deletion of, or actions taken in compliance
with, the covenants described under the caption ‘‘—Certain Covenants,’’ shall be deemed to
impair or affect any rights of holders of the Notes to receive payment of principal of, or
premium, if any, or interest on, the Notes.

Notwithstanding the preceding, without the consent of any holder of Notes, the Issuer, the
Guarantors, the Security Agent and the Trustee (as applicable) may amend or supplement the
Indenture, the Notes, the Note Guarantees, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement or any Security and Guarantee Documents:

(1) to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, error or inconsistency;

(2) to provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes
(provided, that the uncertificated Notes are issued in registered form for purposes of
Section 163(f) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code);

(3) to provide for the assumption of the Issuer’s or a Guarantor’s obligations to holders of
Notes and Note Guarantees in the case of a merger or consolidation or sale of all or
substantially all of the Issuer’s or such Guarantor’s assets, as applicable;

(4) to make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the holders of
Notes or that does not adversely affect the legal rights under the Indenture of any such
holder in any material respect;

(5) to conform the text of the Indenture, the Note Guarantees, the Notes or the Security and
Guarantee Documents to any provision of this ‘‘Description of Notes’’ to the extent that
such provision in this ‘‘Description of Notes’’ was intended to be a verbatim recitation of a
provision of the Indenture, the Note Guarantees, the Notes or the Security and Guarantee
Documents;

235


-----

(6) to release any Note Guarantee and/or to release a Lien over any of the Collateral securing
the Notes in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or
any Security and Guarantee Documents;

(7) to make provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Issuer or a member of
Senior Management thereof) to provide for the issuance of Additional Notes; provided the
issuance of such Additional Notes is in compliance with the covenants described under the
captions ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred
_Stock’’ and ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Liens;’’_

(8) to provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Guarantee in accordance with the
covenant described under the captions ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness
_and Issuance of Preferred Stock’’ or ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees,’’ to add_
Guarantees with respect to the Notes, to add security to or for the benefit of the Notes, or
to confirm and evidence the release, termination, discharge or retaking of any Guarantee
or Lien (including the Collateral and the Security and Guarantee Documents) or any
amendment in respect thereof with respect to or securing the Notes when such release,
termination, discharge or retaking or amendment is provided for under the Indenture, the
Security and Guarantee Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement;

(9) to enter into additional or supplemental Security and Guarantee Documents or otherwise
add to the Collateral;

(10) to add additional parties to the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement or any Security and Guarantee Document to the extent permitted hereunder or
thereunder and to make changes contemplated under the Indenture, or to enter into an
Additional Intercreditor Agreement pursuant to the provisions under, the caption
‘‘—Additional or Amended Intercreditor Agreement;’’ or

(11) to evidence and provide the acceptance of the appointment of a successor Trustee or the
Security Agent under the Indenture or to evidence and provide the acceptance of the
appointment of a Security Agent under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement or any applicable Collateral Document.

The consent of the holders of Notes is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the
particular form of any proposed amendment, supplement or waiver. It is sufficient if such
consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment, supplement or waiver. A consent
to any amendment, supplement or waiver under the Indenture by any holder of Notes given in
connection with a tender of such holder’s Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender.

In connection with such matters, the Trustee and Security Agent (as applicable) shall be entitled
to rely absolutely on an opinion of counsel and an Officer’s Certificate.

## Satisfaction and Discharge

The Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to all Notes issued
thereunder, when:

(1) either:

(a) all Notes that have been authenticated and delivered, except lost, stolen or destroyed
Notes that have been replaced or paid and Notes for whose payment money has been
deposited in trust and thereafter repaid to the Issuer or discharged from such trust as
provided for in the Indenture, have been delivered to the Paying Agent for
cancellation; or

236


-----

(b) all Notes that have not been delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation have
become due and payable by reason of the mailing of a notice of redemption or
otherwise or will become due and payable within one year and the Issuer or any
Guarantor has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or
such other entity designated or appointed (as agent) by it for such purpose) as trust
funds in trust solely for the benefit of the holders, cash in euro, European Government
Obligations or a combination of cash in euro and European Government Obligations, in
amounts as will be sufficient, without consideration of any reinvestment of interest, to
pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness on the Notes not delivered to the Paying
Agent for cancellation for principal, premium and Additional Amounts, if any, and
accrued interest to the date of maturity or redemption;

(2) the Issuer or any Guarantor has paid or caused to be paid all sums payable by the Issuer
and the Guarantors under the Indenture; and

(3) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee under the Indenture to apply
the deposited money toward the payment of the Notes at maturity or on the redemption
date, as the case may be.

In addition, the Issuer must deliver an Officer’s Certificate and an opinion of counsel to the
Trustee stating that all conditions precedent in the Indenture relating to satisfaction and
discharge have been satisfied; provided that any such counsel may rely on any Officer’s
Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (1),
(2) and (3)). If requested by the Issuer in writing, the Trustee may distribute any amount
deposited in trust to the holders prior to the Stated Maturity or the redemption date, as the
case may be; provided, however, that the holders shall have received at least five Business
Days’ notice from the Issuer of such earlier payment date (which may be included in the notice
of redemption).

## Currency Indemnity and Calculation of Euro-Denominated Restrictions

The euro is the sole currency of account with respect to the Notes and payment for all sums
payable by the Issuer and the Guarantors under or in connection with the Notes, including
damages. Any amount received or recovered in a currency other than the euro, whether as a
result of, or the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the
winding-up or dissolution of the Issuer or any Guarantor or otherwise by any holder of a Note,
as the case may be, or by the Trustee, in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from the
Issuer or any Guarantor shall only constitute a discharge to the Issuer or any Guarantor to the
extent of the euro amount which the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received
or recovered in that other currency on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not
practicable to make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it is practicable to
do so).

If that euro amount is less than the euro amount expressed to be due to the recipient or the
Trustee under any Note the Issuer will indemnify them against the cost of making any such
purchase. For the purposes of this currency indemnity provision, it will be prima facie evidence
of the matter stated therein for the holder of a Note or the Trustee to certify in reasonable
detail in a manner satisfactory to the Issuer (indicating the sources of information used) the
loss it incurred in making any such purchase. These indemnities, to the extent permitted by
law, constitute a separate and independent obligation from the Issuer’s other obligations, will
give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, will apply irrespective of any waiver
granted by any holder or the Trustee (other than a waiver of the indemnities set out under the
caption ‘‘—Currency Indemnity and Calculation of Euro-denominated Restrictions’’) and will
continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a
liquidated amount in respect of any sum due under any Note or to the Trustee.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with
any euro-denominated restriction herein, the Euro Equivalent amount for purposes hereof that
is denominated in a non-euro currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency
exchange rate in effect on the date such non-euro amount is incurred or made, as the case
may be.

237


-----

## Concerning the Trustee

The Issuer shall deliver written notice to a responsible officer of the Trustee within 30 days of
becoming aware of the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default. The Trustee will be
permitted to engage in other transactions with the Issuer and the Guarantors; however, if it
acquires any conflicting interest it must eliminate such conflict within 90 days or resign as
Trustee.

The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes will
have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for
exercising any remedy available to the Trustee, subject to certain exceptions. The Indenture
provides that in case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, of which a responsible
officer of the Trustee has written notice of, the Trustee will be required, in the exercise of its
power, to use the degree of care of a prudent person in the conduct of their own affairs.
Subject to such provisions, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights
or powers under the Indenture at the request of any holder of Notes, unless such holder has
offered (and if accepted, provided) to the Trustee security and/or indemnity satisfactory to it
against any loss, liability or expense.

The Issuer and the Guarantors jointly and severally will indemnify the Trustee for certain claims,
liabilities and expenses incurred without gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud on its
part, arising out of or in connection with its duties.

## Listing

Application has been made to list the Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange and to admit the Notes to trading on the Euro MTF market. There can be no
assurance that the application to list the Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange and to admit the Notes for trading on the Euro MTF market will be approved and
settlement of the Notes is not conditioned on obtaining this listing.

## Governing Law

The Indenture, the Notes and the Guarantees will be governed by, and construed in accordance
with, the laws of the State of New York. The Intercreditor Agreement and the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, English law. The
Security and Guarantee Documents will be governed by, and construed in accordance with,
Spanish law, Portuguese law and Luxembourg law, as applicable. For the avoidance of doubt,
Articles 470-1 to 470-19 (inclusive) of the Luxembourg Law dated August 10, 1915 on
commercial companies, as amended will not be applicable to the Notes.

## Consent to Jurisdiction and Service of Process

The Indenture will provide that the Issuer and each Guarantor, will appoint Corporation Service
Company (CSC), as its authorized agent for service of process in any suit, action or proceeding
with respect to the Indenture, the Notes and the Note Guarantees brought in any U.S. federal
or New York state court located in the City of New York and will submit to such jurisdiction.

## Enforceability of Judgments

Since all of the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors are outside the United States, any
judgment obtained in the United States against the Issuer or any Guarantor, may not be
collectable within the United States. See ‘‘Enforcement of Civil Liabilities.’’

238


-----

## Prescription

Claims against the Parent Guarantor, the Issuer or any Guarantor for the payment of principal
of, or interest, premium, or Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes will become void unless
presentation for payment is made as required in the Indenture within a period of seven years,
in the case of principal, or five years, in the case of interest, premium or Additional Amounts,
if any, from the applicable original payment date therefor.

any Reference German Bund Dealer as having a fixed maturity most nearly equal to the
period from such redemption date to, 2021 (in the case of the Floating Rate Notes)

determined in good faith by a responsible accounting or financial officer of such Person),
including in respect of anticipated expense and cost reductions and synergies, as if they
had occurred on the first day of the four- quarter reference period; provided that, if
definitive documentation has been entered into with respect to a Purchase that is part of
the transaction causing a calculation to be made hereunder, Consolidated EBITDA for such
period will be calculated after giving pro forma effect to such Purchase (including
anticipated synergies and cost savings) as if such Purchase had occurred on the first day of
such period, even if the Purchase has not yet been consummated as of the date of
determination;

accordance with IFRS, and operations, businesses or group of assets constituting a business

of such period (taking into account anticipated expense and cost reduction synergies
resulting from any such disposal, as determined in good faith by a responsible accounting
or financial officer);

(3) the consolidated interest expense attributable to discontinued operations, as determined in
accordance with IFRS, and operations, businesses or group of assets constituting a business
or operating unit (and ownership interests therein) disposed of prior to the Calculation
Date, will be excluded on a pro forma basis as if such disposition occurred on the first day
of such period, but only to the extent that the obligations giving rise to such consolidated
interest expense will not be obligations of such Person or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
following the Calculation Date;

(4) any Person that is a Restricted Subsidiary on the Calculation Date will be deemed to have
been a Restricted Subsidiary at all times during such four-quarter period;

determined in good faith by an officer of such Person responsible for accounting or
financial reporting) projected to result from actions taken by such Person or its Restricted
Subsidiaries shall be included as though such synergies had been achieved on the first day
of the relevant period, net of the amount of actual benefits realized during such period
from such actions; provided that such synergies (a) are reasonably identifiable and factually
supportable and (b) are not duplicative of any cost savings, reductions or synergies already
included for such period.

For the purposes of this definition and the definitions of Consolidated EBITDA and
Consolidated Net Income, (a) calculations will be as determined in good faith by a responsible
financial or accounting officer of the Parent Guarantor or an officer of the Parent Guarantor

# Book-entry; Delivery and Form

## General

Certain defined terms used but not defined in this section have the meanings assigned to them
in the Indenture, as described in the ‘‘Description of Notes.’’

Notes sold to ‘‘qualified institutional buyers’’ as defined in Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities
Act (‘‘Rule 144A’’) in reliance on Rule 144A will initially be represented by a global note in
registered form without interest coupons attached (the ‘‘Rule 144A Global Note’’). Notes sold to
persons outside the United States in offshore transactions (as defined in Regulation S under the
U.S. Securities Act (‘‘Regulation S’’)) in reliance on Regulation S will initially be represented by a
global note in registered form without interest coupons attached (the ‘‘Regulation S Global
_Note’’ and, together with the Rule 144A Global Note, the ‘‘Global Notes’’). The Global Notes_
will be deposited, on the closing date, with, or on behalf of, a common depositary and
registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear
and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Note (‘‘Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests’’) and
ownership of interests in the Regulation S Global Note (the ‘‘Regulation S Book-Entry Interests’’
and, together with the Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests, the ‘‘Book-Entry Interests’’) will be
limited to persons that have accounts with Euroclear and/or Clearstream or persons that hold
interests through such participants and has to be in accordance with applicable transfer
restrictions set out in the Indenture and in any applicable securities laws of any state of the
United States or of any other jurisdiction. See ‘‘Notice to U.S Investors,’’ ‘‘Notice to Certain
_European Investors’’ and ‘‘Notice to Investors.’’ Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in_
the Global Notes on behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in their
respective names on the books of their respective depositaries. Except under the limited
circumstances described below, Book-Entry Interests will not be held in definitive certificated
form.

Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through,
records maintained in book-entry form by Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants
pursuant to customary procedures and subject to the applicable rules and procedures
established by Euroclear or Clearstream and their respective participants. Except under the
limited circumstances described below, owners of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will
not be entitled to receive definitive notes in registered form (‘‘Definitive Registered Notes’’).
Instead, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit on their respective book-entry registration and
transfer systems a participant’s account with the interest beneficially owned by such
participant. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states of the United States, may
require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive
certificated form. The foregoing limitations may impair the ability to own, transfer or pledge
Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while the Notes are in global form, holders of Book-Entry
Interests will not be considered the owners or ‘‘holders’’ of Notes for any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable (or
their respective nominees), will be considered the sole holders of Global Notes for all purposes
under the Indenture governing the Notes. As such, participants must rely on the procedures of
Euroclear and/or Clearstream, and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of
Euroclear, Clearstream and the participants through which they own Book-Entry Interests, to
transfer their interests or to exercise any rights of holders under the Indenture governing the
Notes.

Neither the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Trustee, the Calculation Agent, any Paying Agent, the
Transfer Agent, the Registrar nor any of their respective agents will have any responsibility, or

275


-----

be liable, under the Indenture governing the Notes for any aspect of the records relating to
the Book-Entry Interests.

## Redemption of the Global Notes

In the event that any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, Euroclear and/or
Clearstream (or their respective nominees), as applicable, will redeem an equal amount of the
Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note from the amount received by it in respect of the
redemption of such Global Note. The redemption price payable in connection with the
redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by Euroclear
and/or Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or
any portion thereof). The Issuer understands that, under the existing practices of Euroclear and
Clearstream, if fewer than all the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and
Clearstream will credit their respective participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with
adjustments to prevent fractions), by lot or on such other basis as they deem fair and
appropriate; provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest of less than e100,000 principal
amount may be redeemed in part.

## Payments on Global Notes

Payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal, premium,
interest and additional amounts) will be made by the Issuer to the Paying Agent. The Paying
Agent will, in turn, make such payments to Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable. Euroclear
or Clearstream will in turn distribute such payments to participants in accordance with its
procedures. The Issuer will make payments of all such amounts without deduction or
withholding for or on account of any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or
governmental charges of whatever nature except as may be required by law.

The Issuer expects that standing customer instructions and customary practices will govern
payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through such participants, as is
now the case with securities held for the accounts of customers registered in ‘‘street name.’’
Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the
responsibility of such participants, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of
customers registered in ‘‘street name.’’

In order to tender Book-Entry Interests in a change of control offer or asset sale offer, the
holder of the applicable Global Note must, within the time period specified in such offer, give
notice of such tender to the Paying Agent and specify the principal amount of Book-Entry
Interests to be tendered.

Under the terms of the Indenture governing the Notes, the Issuer, the Trustee, any Paying
Agent, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar will treat the registered holder of the Global
Notes (e.g., Euroclear or Clearstream (or their respective nominees)) as the owner thereof for
the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, none of the Issuer,
the Trustee, any Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar or any of its or their
respective agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

- any aspect of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant
relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest or for maintaining,
supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect
participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest; or

- Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant.

The Notes will be issued in denominations of e100,000 and in integral multiples of e1,000 in
excess thereof. We will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Notes; however,

276


-----

owners of the Book-Entry Interest may incur fees normally payable in respect of the
maintenance and operation of accounts in Euroclear or Clearstream.

## Currency of Payment for the Global Notes

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of,
the Global Notes will be paid in euro. Payments will be subject in all cases to any fiscal or
other laws and regulations (including any regulations of the applicable clearing system)
applicable thereto.

## Action by Owners of Book-entry interests

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that they will take any action permitted to
be taken by a holder of Notes (including the presentation of Notes for exchange as described
above) only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the Book-Entry
Interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate
principal amount of Notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given such
direction. Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of
consents, waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if
there is an event of default under the Notes,

Euroclear and Clearstream reserve the right to exchange the Global Notes for Definitive
Registered Notes, and to distribute Definitive Registered Notes to its participants.

## Transfers

Transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in accordance with
Euroclear and Clearstream rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder
requires physical delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell Notes
to persons in states which require physical delivery of securities or to pledge such securities,
such holder must transfer its interests in the Global Notes in accordance with the normal
procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and in accordance with the procedures to be set forth
in the Indenture.

The Rule 144A Global Note will have a legend to the effect set forth under ‘‘Notice to
_Investors.’’ Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on_
transfers and certification requirements discussed under ‘‘Notice to Investors.’’

Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form
of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written
certification (in the form to be provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is
being made in accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144 under the U.S. Securities Act or any
other exemption (if available under the U.S. Securities Act).

Through and including the 40th day after the later of the commencement of the Offering and
the closing of the Offering (the ‘‘40-day period’’), Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be
transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Rule 144A Book-Entry Interest
denominated in the same currency only upon delivery by the transferor of a written
certification (in the form to be provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is
being made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a ‘‘qualified institutional
buyer’’ within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of
Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under ‘‘Notice to
_Investors’’ and in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any other jurisdiction._

After the expiration of the 40-day Period, beneficial interests in a Regulation S Global Note
may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a beneficial interest in the
Rule 144A Global Note without compliance with these certification requirements.

277


-----

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for a
Rule 144A Book-Entry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in
the principal amount of the Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the
principal amount of the Rule 144A Global Note.

Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes
delivery in the form of a Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease
to be a Book- Entry Interest in the first- mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry
Interest in such other Global Note, and accordingly will thereafter be subject to all transfer
restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global
Note for as long as it remains such a Book-Entry Interest.

## Definitive Registered Notes

Under the terms of the Indenture governing the Notes, owners of the Book-Entry Interests will
receive Definitive Registered Notes only in the following circumstances:

- if Euroclear or Clearstream notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act
as depositary and a successor depositary is not appointed by the Issuer within 120 days; or

- if the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through
Euroclear or Clearstream following an Event of Default which results in action by the Trustee
pursuant to the enforcement provisions under the Indenture.

Euroclear has advised the Issuer that upon request by an owner of a Book-Entry Interest
described above, its current procedure is to request that Definitive Registered Notes be issued
to all owners of Book-Entry Interests and not only to the owner who made the initial request.

In any such events described above, the Registrar will issue Definitive Registered Notes,
registered in the name or names, and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or
on behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream (in accordance with their respective customary
procedures and certain certification requirements and based upon directions received from
participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of the Book-Entry Interests). The Definitive
Registered Notes will bear a restrictive legend with respect to certain transfer restrictions,
unless that legend is not required by the Indenture or by applicable law.

In the case of the issuance of Definitive Registered Notes, the holder of a Definitive Registered
Note may transfer such note by surrendering it to the Registrar or a Transfer Agent. In the
event of a partial transfer or a partial redemption of a holding of Definitive Registered Notes
represented by one Definitive Registered Note, a Definitive Registered Note will be issued to
the transferee in respect of the part transferred and a new Definitive Registered Note in
respect of the balance of the holding not transferred or redeemed will be issued to the
transferor or the holder, as applicable; provided that no Definitive Registered Note in a
denomination less than e100,000 will be issued. The Issuer will bear the cost of preparing,
printing, packaging and delivering the Definitive Registered Notes.

The Issuer will not be required to register the transfer or exchange of Definitive Registered
Notes for a period of 15 calendar days preceding (i) the record date for any payment of
interest on the Notes; (ii) any date fixed for redemption of the Notes; or (iii) the date fixed for
selection of the Notes to be redeemed in part. Also, the Issuer is not required to register the
transfer or exchange of any Notes selected for redemption or which the holder has tendered
(and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a change of control offer or asset sale
offer. In the event of the transfer of any Definitive Registered Note, the Trustee may require a
holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents as
described in the Indenture. The Issuer may require a holder to pay any transfer taxes and fees
required by law and permitted by the Indenture and the Notes.

278


-----

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such a Definitive
Registered Note has been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, or if such Definitive Registered
Note is mutilated and is surrendered to the registrar or at the office of a transfer agent, the
Issuer will issue and the Trustee will authenticate a replacement Definitive Registered Note if
the Trustee’s and the Issuer’s requirements are met. The Issuer or the Trustee may require a
holder requesting replacement of a Definitive Registered Note to furnish an indemnity bond
sufficient in the judgment of both to protect themselves, the Trustee or the Paying Agent
appointed pursuant to the Indenture from any loss which any of them may suffer if a
Definitive Registered Note is replaced. The Issuer may charge for its expenses incurred in
replacing a Definitive Registered Note.

In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or
is about to become due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by the Issuer
pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer, in its discretion, may, instead of issuing
a new Definitive Registered Note, pay, redeem or purchase such Definitive Registered Note, as
the case may be.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a
Global Note only in accordance with the Indenture and, if required, only after the transferor
first delivers to the trustee a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to
the effect that such transfer will comply with the transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes.
See ‘‘Notice to Investors.’’

So long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the
rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer will publish a notice of any
issuance of Definitive Registered Notes on the website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange
(www.bourse.lu). Payment of principal, any repurchase price, premium and interest on
Definitive Registered Notes will be payable at the office of the Paying Agent in the Grand
Duchy of Luxembourg or at the registered office of the Issuer so long as the Notes are listed
on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange so require.

## Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and
Clearstream, as applicable. The Issuer provides the following summaries of those operations
and procedures solely for the convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each
settlement system are controlled by that settlement system and may be changed at any time.
Neither the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, any Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent nor
the Registrar nor any of their respective agents are responsible for those operations or
procedures.

The Issuer understands as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream. Euroclear and
Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They also facilitate the clearance
and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through
electronic book- entry changes in accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream
provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration,
clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and
Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants
are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust
companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also
available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or
maintain a custodian relationship with a Euroclear or Clearstream participant, either directly or
indirectly.

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on
behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest

279


-----

to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or
Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by
the lack of a definite certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that
certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability
to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial
interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to
the 144A Global Notes only through Euroclear or Clearstream participants.

## Global Clearance and Settlement under the Book-entry System

The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be listed on the Official List of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on the Euro MTF market. Transfers of
interests in the Global Notes between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected
in the ordinary way in accordance with their respective rules and operating procedures.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to
facilitate transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or
Clearstream, as the case may be, they are under no obligation to perform or continue to
perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued or modified at any time.
None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar, any Paying Agent or any of
their respective agents will have any responsibility for the performance by Euroclear or
Clearstream or their respective participants or indirect participants of their respective
obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

## Initial Settlement

Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in Euros. Book-Entry Interests owned through
Euroclear or Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to
conventional bonds in registered form. Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities
custody accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream holders on the business day following the
settlement date against payment for value of the settlement date.

## Secondary Market Trading

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear or Clearstream and will
settle in same-day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to
establish at the time of trading of any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the
seller’s accounts are located to ensure that settlement can be made on the desired value date.

# Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations

## European Union Insolvency

The Issuer and the Guarantors are incorporated and/or organized under the laws of Member
States of the European Union.

Pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation, (which applies to all European Union Member States
other than Denmark), the courts of the Member State in which a company’s ‘‘center of main
interests’’ (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, ‘‘COMI’’) is
situated have jurisdiction to open main insolvency proceedings. The determination of where a
company has its COMI is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member States
may have differing and even conflicting views.

Although there is a rebuttable presumption under Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation
that a company has its COMI in the Member State in which it has its registered office in the
absence of proof to the contrary (which presumption shall not apply if the registered office has
been moved to another Member State within the three month period prior to the request for
the opening of insolvency proceedings), Article 3(1), second sentence, of the EU Insolvency
Regulation states that the COMI shall be the place where the debtor conducts the
administration of its interests on a regular basis and ‘‘is therefore ascertainable by third
parties.’’ The courts have taken into consideration a number of factors in determining the
COMI of a company, including, in particular, where board meetings are held, the location
where the company conducts the majority of its business or has its head office, and the
location where the large majority of the company’s creditors are established. Recital 30 of the
EU Insolvency Regulation states that the presumption should be rebutted where the company’s
central administration is located in a Member State other than that of its registered office, and
where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is
ascertainable by third parties, that the company’s actual center of management and supervision
and of the management of its interests is located in that other Member State. A company’s
COMI is not a static concept and may change from time to time but is determined for the
purposes of deciding which courts have competent jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings
at the time of the filing of the insolvency petition.

If the COMI of a debtor is and will remain located in the state in which it has its registered
office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the company under the EU Insolvency
Regulation would be commenced in such jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such
jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in
Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation. Insolvency proceedings commenced in one Member
State under the EU Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in the other EU Member States
(other than Denmark), although territorial (secondary) insolvency proceedings may be
commenced in another Member State. It should be highlighted that, as opposed to the former
EU Insolvency Regulation, Annex A also currently includes processes known as ‘‘pre-insolvency’’
ones, which shall therefore also benefit from the legal consequences provided in the EU
Insolvency Regulation for ‘‘pure’’ insolvency proceedings, such as the automatic recognition of
their declaration in the European Union (except Denmark).

If the COMI of a company is in one Member State (other than Denmark) under Article 3(2) of
the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have
jurisdiction to open territorial insolvency proceedings against that company only if such
company has an ‘‘establishment’’ (within the meaning and as defined in Article 2(10) of the EU
Insolvency Regulation) in the territory of such other Member State. An ‘‘establishment’’ is
defined to mean ‘‘any place of operations where a company carries out or has carried out in

281


-----

the three month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a
non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets.’’ Accordingly, the opening of
territorial (secondary) insolvency proceedings in another EU Member State will also be possible
if the debtor had an establishment in such EU Member State in the three month period prior
to the request for commencement of main insolvency proceedings.

The effects of those insolvency proceedings opened in that other Member State are restricted
to the assets of the company situated in such other Member State. Where main proceedings in
the Member State in which the company has its COMI have not yet been opened, territorial
insolvency proceedings can be opened in another Member State where the company has an
establishment only where either (i) insolvency proceedings cannot be opened in the Member
State in which the company’s COMI is situated under that Member State’s law or (ii) the
opening of territorial insolvency proceedings is requested by (a) a creditor whose claim arises
from or is in connection with the operation of an establishment situated within the territory of
the Member State where the opening of territorial proceedings is requested or (b) a public
authority which, under the law of the Member State within the territory of which the
establishment is situated, has the right to request the opening of insolvency proceedings.
Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary insolvency
proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain exceptions, be governed by the lex fori
concursus, i.e., the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction over the
insolvency proceedings of the company. Those courts with jurisdiction to declare the opening
of insolvency proceedings have also jurisdiction to rule on any action which may be deemed as
directly arising from the insolvency proceedings which also has a close relationship with the
insolvency proceedings.

The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the
court opening the main proceedings, which will be given the same effect in the other Member
States so long as no secondary proceedings have been opened there. The liquidator appointed
by a court in a Member State that has jurisdiction to open main proceedings (because the
company’s COMI is there) may exercise the powers conferred on it by the law of that Member
State in another Member State (such as to remove assets of the company from that other
Member State) subject to certain limitations so long as no insolvency proceedings have been
opened in that other Member State or any preservation measure taken to the contrary further
to a request to open insolvency proceedings in that other Member State where the company
has assets. The EU Insolvency Regulation has created a treatment for groups of companies
experiencing difficulties by the commencement of group coordination proceedings and the
appointment of an insolvency practitioner in order to facilitate the effective administration of
the insolvency proceedings of our group’s members.

## Spain

**_Spanish insolvency laws_**
Under Spanish insolvency laws, your right to receive payments of interest and principal on the
Notes in case of insolvency may be more limited than would be the case under U.S. bankruptcy
laws.

The Spanish Insolvency Law, governs certain out-of-court restructurings or refinancings and
court insolvency proceedings. This section summarizes the main aspects of Spanish insolvency
laws affecting corporations, and not individuals, as there are certain specialties for the
insolvency of the latest.

The Spanish Insolvency Law foresees a pre-insolvency mechanism whereby the debtor may file
the communication foreseen under Article 5 bis, which is included in Annex A of the EU
Insolvency Regulation. Pursuant to this 5Bis process, the legal duty to file for insolvency which
will be referred to below is legally suspended if the debtor notifies the applicable court that it
has initiated negotiations with its creditors to obtain support to reach either an anticipated

282


-----

CVA (as defined below) (propuesta de convenio anticipado), or an out-of-court collective
refinancing agreement set out in Article 71.bis.1 or in the Additional Disposition IV of the
Spanish Insolvency Law. Effectively, by means of this 5 bis communication, the debtor gains a
three-month period as from the date when the debtor submits such 5 bis notice as to achieve a
refinancing agreement with its creditors or to obtain accessions to an anticipated CVA. During
such three-month period of time, creditors’ petitions for borrower’s insolvency will not be
accepted. Once the three-month period elapses, the debtor must submit the petition for
insolvency within the following month, unless the insolvency has been resolved. A petition for
insolvency potentially filed by a creditor within this month will not be admitted by the court
unless the borrower does not file for insolvency by the end of the month. In the absence of
insolvency’s petition by the end of the 5bis period, the court is not entitled to declare the
insolvency ex officio.

Additionally, during the four-month protection period provided for upon the filing of the 5 bis
notice (or three months according to certain case law), enforcement will be prevented: (i) by
creditors, other than public, over assets which are necessary for the continuity of the debtor’s
business; and (ii) by financial creditors referred to in the Additional Provision IV of the Spanish
Insolvency Law over any asset, provided creditors holding at least 51% of the financial
indebtedness (by value) of the insolvent debtor have expressed their will to commence
negotiations in order to reach a refinancing agreement and have committed not to initiate or
continue enforcement proceedings against the debtor. These provisions shall not prevent from
enforcement of any security right being formally commenced, but the enforcement process
shall be automatically suspended within the referred 5bis period. Further, any outstanding
enforcement action which falls into the above categories that was commenced before the
filing for a pre-insolvency moratorium will be suspended. This suspension will last until: (i) a
refinancing agreement foreseen under article 71 bis 1 of the Spanish Insolvency Law is agreed
on; (ii) a ruling from the court admitting the application to homologate a refinancing
agreement is issued; (iii) an extrajudicial payment agreement is reached; (iv) enough adhesions
to an anticipated CVA are obtained; or (v) the insolvency proceeding has been declared.
Despite of the foregoing, enforcement of security in respect of financial collateral falling under
the scope of the Spanish Collateral Act (Real Decreto-ley 5/2005, de 11 de marzo, de reformas
_urgentes para el impulso a la productividad y para la mejora de la contrataci´on p´ublica) will_
not be prevented upon the filing of the 5 bis notice.

The Spanish Insolvency Law also foresees under Additional Provision IV the possibility of a
debtor to homologate a refinancing agreement with its creditors holding financial claims. The
main effect of this type of agreement is that it foresees cramming down mechanisms to
dissenting or non-signing creditors holding financial claims if certain majorities are met, and
that the refinancing agreement cannot be subject to claw back actions. In this regard, pursuant
to the homologacion of a refinancing agreement (i) stays of payments of up to ten years,
(ii) any discharge of debt, (iii) conversion of debts into equity of the refinanced debtor,
(iv) conversion of debts into profit participating loans (pr´estamos participativos) with a term of
up to ten years and (v) transfer of assets or rights to the creditors in payment for all or part of
their debt can be extended to creditors holding financial claims. Once the homologation
petition is admitted by the court, enforcement claims are suspended until the ruling declaring
the homologation is served. This ruling declaring the homologation of the refinancing
agreement can be challenged by dissenting and non-signing creditors in front of the same
court who ruled on the homologation, exclusively on the following merits: (i) the legal
majorities for the approval and extension of effects under the refinancing agreement were not
actually reached; or (ii) the refinancing agreement extended to the challenging creditor causes
a disproportionate sacrifice to it. The judgment ruling on the challenge is not subject to
appeal.

Under current Spanish insolvency laws, a debtor (in the case of a company, its directors) is
required to file for insolvency at court (which are known as ‘‘concurso de acreedores’’) upon

283


-----

inability to regularly pay its liabilities as they become due and payable. The debtor is also
entitled (but not required) to apply for such insolvency proceedings when it foresees its
inability to regularly and timely pay liabilities as they become due and payable. Creditors, even
holding non-due and payable debts, provided that they have not acquired their claims within
the previous six months and once their claims have matured do also have standing to petition
insolvency when certain circumstances set forth in Section 2.4 of the Spanish Insolvency Law are
evidenced at court. The debtor must file a petition for insolvency within two months after it
becomes aware, or should have become aware, of its state of insolvency (inability to regularly
pay the debts as they come due and payable, as explained). It is presumed that the debtor
becomes aware of its insolvency, unless otherwise proven, if any of the circumstances that
entail a creditor to file for the debtor’s insolvency occur (i.e. those set out in Section 2.4 of the
Spanish Insolvency Law). Where the debtor fails to file a petition for insolvency within the time
period established by law (two months), the insolvency is legally presumed ‘‘guilty’’ (unless
evidence is provided on the insolvency not having been caused nor aggravated with fraud or
gross negligence).

If filed by the debtor, the insolvency is deemed ‘‘voluntary’’ (concurso voluntario) and, if filed
by a creditor, the insolvency is deemed ‘‘mandatory’’ (concurso necesario). In the case of
voluntary insolvency, as a general rule, the debtor still maintains the management and powers
of disposal over its assets, although it is subject to the intervention (intervenci´on) of the
insolvency administrator (administrador concursal) or administrators, as applicable. In the case
of mandatory insolvency, as a general rule, the debtor’s management powers are suspended,
and management’s former power, including the powers to dispose of assets, are conferred
solely in the insolvency administrators (sustituci´on). Despite the foregoing, the insolvency court,
upon the request of the insolvency administrator, may shift the intervention scheme for the
suspension scheme and vice versa. The time between the petition and the insolvency
declaration by the court will depend upon a number of factors, including whether the filing
has been made by the debtor or the creditor (and, in turn, whether the debtor has challenged
the petition made by the creditor), whether all appropriate documentation has been submitted
on a timely basis or is incomplete, and the workload of the court.

Creditors may apply for a joint insolvency declaration of two or more of its debtors if either
(i) the assets of the relevant debtor are commingled, or (ii) they form part of the same group
of companies. Therefore, the request for the joint insolvency of two or more legal entities may
only be filed by a common creditor of the relevant companies and each of the affected
companies must in fact be separately insolvent. Joint insolvency may also be requested by
companies themselves, provided that they form part of the same group. Any of the insolvent
debtors, or any of the insolvency administrators, as the case may be, may apply for the
accumulation of insolvency proceedings already declared under certain circumstances (and, in
particular, if the insolvent debtors form part of the same group of companies). In addition,
creditors may apply for the accumulation of the insolvency proceedings of two or more of its
debtors already declared if either (i) the assets of the relevant debtor are commingled, (ii) they
form part of the same group of companies, or (iii) they are managers, shareholders, partners or
members personally liable for the debts of the debtor if it is a legal entity, provided that a
petition has not been submitted by any of the insolvent debtors or by the insolvency
administrators. Insolvency proceedings declared jointly or accumulated are processed in
coordination, without consolidation of the estate of the insolvent debtors. As a result, and as a
general rule, a ‘‘group insolvency’’ does not lead to a commingling of the debtors’ assets and
creditors of such group. This means that the creditors of one company of the group will not
have recourse against other companies of the same group (except where cross-guarantees
exist). The current system is basically a procedural one, aimed at making the insolvency
proceedings as time and cost efficient as possible. However, exceptionally, and for the purpose
of the drafting of the insolvency report by the insolvency administrators only, assets and
liabilities amongst the companies declared insolvent may be consolidated where there is a

284


-----

confusion of states, and assets and liabilities belonging to each of the companies cannot be
identified.

The general principle of ‘‘no termination effect’’ is established such that all bilateral
agreements providing reciprocal obligations among the parties remain effective at the time of
the declaration of insolvency. Therefore, the declaration of insolvency does not impair the
existence of these contracts entered into by the debtor, which would remain in force. Any
contractual arrangements establishing the termination of such bilateral contract and/or
entitling the relevant creditor to terminate it in the event of the declaration of insolvency of
the debtor will be deemed as non-included, and thus unenforceable, except if expressly
permitted by specific laws (i.e., agency laws), or the unilateral termination of the contract is
allowed by Law.

As a general rule, the declaration of insolvency does not alter the general contractual rules on
termination of those bilateral agreements, but under the Spanish Insolvency Law, the court
may decide to remedy an eventual default of the insolvent party by reinstating an agreement
on the interest of the insolvency, with the effect that any outstanding amounts and further
payments under the agreement will be deemed as post-insolvency claims. If the court deems it
appropriate for the interests of the insolvent party, and following a request from the insolvent
debtor (in case of the intervention scheme) or the insolvency administrator (in case of the
suspension scheme), it is also entitled to terminate those kinds of agreements, with
compensation for damages paid as a post-insolvency claim if it deems it is best for the
insolvency proceeding. There are specific rules for employment agreements, mainly affecting
collective dismissals, which are dealt with by the insolvency judge.

There is a two-year clawback period starting backward from the date on which insolvency is
declared, although transactions within that period will not automatically become void as a
result of the initiation of insolvency proceedings, but instead the insolvency administrators
must expressly challenge those transactions. Also, creditors who have applied to exercise any
clawback action (stating the specific action they aim to contest or revoke and their grounds),
shall be entitled to exercise such action if the insolvency administrators do not do so within the
two months following their request. Under such clawback action, acts detrimental
(perjudiciales) to the debtor’s estate carried out during the two years prior to the date the
insolvency is declared may be rescinded, regardless of either fraudulent intention (transactions
taking place earlier than two years before insolvency has been declared are subject to the
general regime of rescission under the Spanish Civil Code), or of their link to the insolvency.
Acts where no consideration is received for a disposed asset and acts that result in the early
repayment or settlements of obligations which would have become due after the declaration
of insolvency (unless such obligations were secured by means of an in rem security) are deemed
detrimental, and this is a non-rebuttable presumption. In addition, unless the debtor or
another affected party (such as a creditor) can prove otherwise to the court’s satisfaction, a
disposal made in favor of a ‘‘related person or entity’’ (as detailed in the following paragraph)
as well as the creation of a security interest securing a preexisting obligation or a new
obligation that replaces an existing one, and those payments or other acts extinguishing
obligations that would have become due after the declaration of insolvency and which are
secured by means of an in rem security, are presumed to be detrimental, and this is a
rebuttable presumption. In the case of actions not covered by the presumptions above, the
burden of proof is on the person bringing the action of rescission. For these purposes, it must
be noted that any amendment and extension of the security interests and the guarantees
granted by the Issuer and the Guarantors in respect of the Notes made after the Issue Date
could constitute a transaction subject to claw-back if insolvency is declared within such
two-year period. To such end, Spanish case law has construed the detriment such as ‘‘an
unjustified sacrifice caused to the debtor’s estate.’’ Acts deriving from the debtor’s ordinary
course of business made at arm’s length and certain refinancing arrangements (acuerdos de
_refinanciaci´on) meeting certain legal requirements set forth in Article 71 bis of the Spanish_

285


-----

Insolvency Law, or, in the case may be, the Additional Provision IV of the Spanish Insolvency
Law, may not be rescinded. On this regard, according to the latest Spanish Supreme Court case
law, intra-group guarantees and security (such as those granted by the Guarantors in order to
secure the Notes) and are not deemed as acts with no consideration when, at the same time, in
exchange for providing the said guarantees, or security, the guaranteed creditor undertakes to
provide something in exchange (so they are deemed contextual). On the other hand, if the
intra-group guarantee is not deemed contextual, the guarantee would be considered an act
with no consideration, so that the non-rebuttable presumption referred to above could apply
as to rescind such guarantee. Additionally, intragroup guarantees, including contextual ones,
are also affected by the rebuttable presumption related to acts made in favor to a related
party. As to rebut this presumption in order to avoid the rescission of the guarantee, evidence
should be provided that the guarantee was granted in exchange for an equivalent
consideration or advantage received by the guarantor. For these purposes, this benefit or
compensation does not have to be a payment or direct capital allocation, but rather it may
consist of an indirect benefit for the guarantor. On the contrary, justifying the intra-group
guarantee exclusively on the interest of the guarantor as a member of the group may not be
deemed sufficient as to rebut this presumption.

In the case of a legal entity, the following shall be deemed to be ‘‘related person’’:
(i) shareholders with unlimited liability (in case such shareholders are natural persons it would
include any specially related party to these shareholders, as described herein); (ii) limited
liability shareholders holding, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the insolvent company’s
share capital (or 5% if the company is listed) by the time the credit right under dispute in the
insolvency scenario arises; (iii) directors (including shadow directors), liquidators and those
holding general powers of attorney from the insolvent company, as well as such individuals
holding such positions within two years prior to the declaration of insolvency; and
(iv) companies pertaining to the same group as the debtor and their common shareholders
_provided such shareholders meet the minimum shareholding requirements set forth in_
(ii) above. Notwithstanding the above, creditors who have directly or indirectly capitalized their
credit rights or were appointed as directors pursuant to a collective refinancing arrangement
entered into in compliance with the requirements set forth in Article 71.bis or the Additional
Provision IV of the Spanish Insolvency Law, or to a CVA, shall not be considered as being in a
special relationship with the debtor for the purposes of classification of credits, as a result of
the financing granted under such refinancing arrangement. Those creditors executing a
collective refinancing agreement in compliance with the requirements set forth in Article 71.bis
or the Additional Provision IV of the Spanish Insolvency Law, or a CVA, shall neither be deemed
as shadow directors as a result of the covenants assumed by the debtor in relation to the
viability plan, unless the existence of a circumstance justifying the shadow directorship may be
proven. Additionally, claims different from loans and acts with analogous purpose held by
those shareholders referred to in (i) and (iv) above shall not be subordinated. Likewise,, it is
established the rebuttable presumption that the assignees of the above are also ‘‘specially
related persons’’ if the assignment has occurred within two years prior to the declaration of
insolvency.

In any event, set-off is prohibited unless the legal requirements for the set-off were satisfied
prior to the declaration of insolvency or the claim of the insolvent debtor is governed by a law
that permits set-off in case of insolvency.

Interests cease to accrue since the declaration of insolvency, except for secured claims in which
case interests continue to accrue up to the value of the security (although the Supreme Court
has recently ruled such continuation does not apply to moratorium interests and for the
recognition of ordinary interests it is necessary that the relevant creditor has communicated a
contingent claim to the insolvency administrator.

286


-----

The Spanish Insolvency Law makes a distinction between general debts under insolvency
proceedings and debts against the insolvency estate (cr´editos contra la masa). Debts against the
insolvency estate, which include, among others, (i) certain amounts of the employee payroll
due before the declaration of insolvency, (ii) costs and expenses of the insolvency proceedings,
(iii) certain amounts arising from services provided by the insolvent debtor under reciprocal
contracts and outstanding obligations that remain in force after insolvency proceedings are
declared and deriving from obligations to return and indemnify in cases of voluntary
termination or breach by the insolvent debtor, (iv) those that derive from the exercise of a
clawback action within the insolvency proceedings of acts performed by the insolvent debtor
and correspond to a refund of consideration received by it (except in cases of bad faith),
(v) certain amounts arising from obligations created by law or from the non-contractual
liability of the insolvent debtor after the declaration of insolvency and until its conclusion,
(vi) 50% of the funds lent under a refinancing arrangement entered into in compliance with
the requirements set forth in Article 71 bis or Additional Provision IV of the Spanish Insolvency
Law and (vii) certain debts incurred by the debtor following the declaration of insolvency, are
not considered part of the debtor’s general debt and are payable when due according to their
own terms (and, therefore, are paid before other debts under insolvency proceedings).

The Spanish Insolvency Law procedure includes a common phase (during which, among others,
insolvency administrators are appointed, an inventory of the assets and a list of creditors is
prepared and claims ranked, as detailed below) and three potential results: (i) a composition
agreement between the creditors and the debtor (‘‘CVA’’), (ii) the debtor’s liquidation,
(iii) termination of the proceedings due to a debtor’s overcoming its insolvency, or
(iv) termination of the proceedings due to the lack of available assets for the settlement of
post-insolvency claims (cr´editos contra la masa).

A CVA may be entered into between the debtor and the majority of the creditors involving a
delay in payment, partial cancellation of debts, partial conversion of debts into equity of the
insolvent debtor, convertible bonds, subordinated loans, profit participating loans, PIK loans or
any other different financing instrument with a different ranking, maturity or any other
different features than the financing instruments previously held by the relevant creditor. It is
not effective until the court gives its approval. The court may refuse to do so when there has
been a breach of the law or when certain parties have shown that the CVA is objectively
unviable. The CVA may be imposed on ordinary or subordinated creditors but also on secured
and general privileged creditors if certain majorities are met within those categories. For this
purpose the Spanish Insolvency Law divides secured creditors and creditors with a general
priority into four categories: (a) labor creditors; (b) public authority creditors; (c) financial
creditors (regardless of whether they are supervised by a regulatory body such as the Bank of
Spain); and (d) any other creditors—mainly commercial creditors.

Although upon approval of the CVA most of the effects of the insolvency proceedings cease,
strictly speaking the proceedings do not terminate until the terms of the CVA are completely
fulfilled.

In the case of liquidation, the debtor ceases to manage its assets (in the case of a company, its
directors would cease to act), and is replaced with the insolvency administrator who then turns
into the liquidator of the insolvent debtor. The insolvency administrator liquidates the debtor’s
assets by selling them to distribute the money obtained among the creditors according to the
priority rules established by the Spanish Insolvency Law (as explained below). For these
purposes a liquidation plan is produced by the insolvency administrator and approved by the
court (the debtor, the employees’ representatives and creditors may provide comments and
suggestions to the relevant plan).

Article 176.4 of the Spanish Insolvency Law also foresees the termination of the insolvency
proceeding at any stage when it is proven that all credits have been paid, or that all creditors

287


-----

have been entirely satisfied by other means, or that the situation of insolvency (i.e. the
impossibility to face payment obligations regularly) has been overcome.

Finally, it must be noted that article 176 bis of the Spanish Insolvency Law foresees the
termination of the insolvency proceeding at any time when no future claw back actions are
envisaged, nor actions claiming liability to third parties, nor the assessment of the proceeding
as guilty, and the current assets are not enough to pay all post-insolvency debts.

Upon the declaration of insolvency, the court issues an insolvency order containing an express
request for the creditors of the insolvent debtor to declare all debts owed to them by the
debtor, providing documentation to justify such debts, within a period of one month from the
publication of the insolvency declaration in the Spanish Official Gazette (BOE). Based on the
documentation provided by the creditors and documentation held by the debtor, the
insolvency administrator draws up a list of acknowledged creditors and classifies them
according to the categories established under law:

(i) Debts benefiting from special privileges (‘‘cr´editos con privilegio especial’’), representing
security on certain assets (in essence, security) and up to the lower of (i) the maximum
secured liabilities under the relevant security, and (ii) the ;value of the collateral’. For the
purposes of Article 90.3, the value of the collateral constituted to secure the claims that
have special preference shall be stated. To determine this, the debts pending that have a
preferential security on the same asset shall be deducted from the nine tenths of the fair
value of the asset or right on which the security has been created, without the value of
the security being lower than zero in any case, nor exceeding the value of the preferential
credit or the value of the maximum mortgage or pledge liability that has been agreed.

For these exclusive purposes, fair value is construed as:

a) In the case of securities listed on an official secondary market, or on another regulated
market, or money market instruments, the average weighted price at which they have
been negotiated on one or several regulated markets in the last quarter prior to the
date of declaration opening the insolvency proceedings, pursuant to a certificate issued
by the company governing the concerned official secondary market or the regulated
market.

b) In the case of real estate, that resulting from the report issued by a recognized
appraisal company registered with the Special Register of the Bank of Spain.

c) In the case of assets or rights other than those stated in the preceding paragraphs, that
resulting from a report issued by an independent expert pursuant to the generally
accepted principles and rules of valuation recognized for such assets.

(ii) These privileges may entail separate enforcement proceedings, subject to certain
restrictions derived from a waiting period that may last up to one year. In general terms,
privileged creditors are not subject to the CVA, except if they give their express support by
voting in favor of the restructuring arrangement or certain qualified majorities are met. In
the event of liquidation, they are the first to collect payment against the assets on which
their debt is secured.

However, the insolvency administrator has the option to halt any enforcement of the
security and pay these claims under specific payment rules.

(iii) Debts benefiting from general privileges (‘‘cr´editos con privilegio general’’) including,
among others, labor and public debts. General privileges for public debt, other than debt
relating to tax withholdings and certain social security obligations, are recognized for half
of the amount of the debt. General privileges are also recognized for half of the amount
of non-subordinated debt held by the first creditor to apply for the insolvency proceedings
of the debtor (in case of necessary insolvency). Funds lent under a refinancing arrangement

288


-----

entered into in compliance with the requirements set forth in Article 71.6 of the Spanish
Insolvency Law in the amount not admitted as a post-insolvency debt shall be also
considered as debts with general privileges. Creditors whose debt benefits from general
privileges are not affected by CVA provided that they do not agree to it or that certain
majorities are not met, and, in the event of liquidation, they are the first to collect
payment, in the order established under law and out of the non-charged assets of the
insolvent debtor once all post-insolvency claims have been settled.

(iv) Ordinary debts (non-subordinated and non-privileged creditors). Creditors of ordinary debt
(‘‘cr´editos ordinarios’’) will be paid after creditors benefiting from special or general
privileges on a pro rata basis vis `a vis each other.

(v) Subordinated debts (classified as such by virtue of the underlying credit agreement or
pursuant to law). Subordinated debts (‘‘cr´editos subordinados’’) include, among others,
debts communicated late (outside the specific one-month period mentioned above), credits
that are contractually subordinated vis-`a-vis all other credits of the debtor; credits relating
to surcharge and unpaid interest claims (including default interest) except for those credits
secured with an in rem right up to the secured amount; fines, debts held by ‘‘specially
related persons,’’ as explained above, claims resulting from acts that were set aside where
the creditor was declared in the judgment to have acted in bad faith; and certain credits
deriving from contracts with reciprocal obligations if the creditor attempts to prevent the
fulfillment of the contract to the detriment of the insolvency interests. Subordinated
creditors are not entitled to vote on the CVA and in practice usually have very limited
chances of collection, as a result of the ranking established by law.

Under the Spanish Insolvency Law, the intercompany loans between Midco and Empark,
Empark and Dornier and between Midco and the Issuer would be treated as subordinated
debt.

_Applicable jurisdiction_
As discussed above, the applicable jurisdiction to conduct an insolvency proceeding is the one
in which the insolvent party has its COMI.

In the event that any of the Guarantors becomes insolvent and is subject to the current Spanish
Insolvency Law, its Guarantee will be treated as ordinary debt unless it is either (a) secured; or
(b) subordinated by application of any of the criteria indicated above. In addition, the insolvent
entity’s directors or shadow directors may be personally liable for the outstanding claims if the
court determines that the insolvency resulted or was aggravated with fraud or gross negligence
(concurso culpable) and provided that the qualification section has been opened.

In this respect, please note that the proceedings to characterize the insolvency as guilty
(qualification proceedings) only commence: (i) in cases of insolvency where the company is
liquidated, in all cases, and (ii) in cases of insolvency which conclude with a CVA being reached,
only when such CVA imposes, to all creditors or to creditors belonging to one or several classes,
a debt reduction of more than one third and a moratorium of debt in excess of three years.

Qualification proceedings start with the allegations of the interested parties, followed by the
reports of the insolvency administrator and the public prosecutor. Only in case either of these
two bodies proposes characterizing the insolvency as ‘guilty’, the procedure will continue in
relation to the people who the former has identified as being affected by the characterization,
who are summonsed at that time, so that they may make allegations and present evidence.
After the hearing, the insolvency characterization proceedings conclude with the
characterization (assessment) of the insolvency as ‘fortuitous’ or ‘guilty’, by virtue of the
judgment.

The law also establishes assumptions of guilty insolvency with regard to the insolvency. Some
assumptions do not admit proof to the contrary (e.g. substantial irregularities in the

289


-----

accounting, serious inaccuracies in the documents submitted with the application, concealment
of assets); whereas others do admit proof to the contrary (e.g. breach of the legal duties to
apply for the declaration of insolvency, to approve annual accounts or to collaborate with the
insolvency receivers, or, in case of shareholders, refusing to capitalize credits without just
cause).

If the insolvency is characterized as ‘guilty’, the people affected by this characterization will be
barred from acting as directors for a term between two and 15 years, will lose any rights they
may have in the insolvency proceedings, and will be obliged to indemnify damages.

If the insolvency is classified as ‘guilty’ and concludes with the company’s liquidation, people
affected by the qualification proceedings may also be sentenced to pay the company’s debts
that have not been settled with the proceeds obtained from the company´s liquidation, in full
or in part, to the extent those circumstances leading to the disqualification of the insolvency
have created or aggravated the insolvency.

Liability in the context of an insolvency extends, as in the commercial context, to directors and
shadow directors, with the latter being understood as those individuals who, with no formal
designation, exercise the authority corresponding to the members of the company’s
management body (which entails a transfer of duties, without their prior appointment for this
purpose).

Furthermore, in the context of an insolvency, anyone who held the post of director (or acted as
a shadow director) in the two years prior to the declaration of insolvency can be held liable,
provided that the events that led to the qualification of the insolvency can be attributed to
them.

In order to ensure this liability, from the time insolvency is declared, the judge of the
insolvency proceedings may order, at his or her own initiative or at the justified request of the
insolvency receivers, as a precautionary measure, the seizure of assets and rights of the
company’s directors and shadow directors, attorneys and any other parties holding this post
during the two years prior to the date of declaration of insolvency, when the actions justify the
possibility that, in the judgment on the insolvency qualification proceedings, the persons
affected by the seizure of assets may be ordered to cover the deficit resulting from the
liquidation.

Finally, shareholders may also be found liable for refusing to capitalize credits ‘‘without just
cause,’’ as so defined in the Spanish Insolvency Law.

_Moratorium_
The Spanish Insolvency Law imposes a moratorium on the enforcement of secured creditor’s
rights (in rem security) in the event of insolvency over assets that are necessary for the
continuation of the debtor’s activity. The moratorium would take effect following the
declaration of insolvency until the earlier of (i) one year from the declaration of the insolvency
if the insolvent company has not been placed in liquidation, (ii) the date the creditors reach a
CVA that does not affect the exercise of the rights granted by the security interest, or (iii) the
Insolvency Judge confirms that the relevant assets or right is not necessary for the continuation
of the debtor’s business activity with the limitations explained above. This limitation would also
apply to enforcement proceedings initiated prior to the insolvency declaration as they will be
suspended from the date of the insolvency declaration.

In this regard, shares or stakes in companies intended exclusively for holding assets and
liabilities necessary for its financing shall not be considered necessary to continue the activity,
as long as enforcement of the security created on these does not give rise to a cause of
resolution or amendment to the contractual relations that allow the insolvent debtor to
maintain operation of the asset.

290


-----

Additionally, once the insolvency proceedings are opened, singular, judicial or extrajudicial
enforcements may not be initiated, nor may administrative or tax demands for payment to be
collected coercively against the assets of the debtor be continued (unless an attachment order
(diligencia de embargo) over an asset not necessary for the continuation of the business was
already issued by the administrative body prior to the declaration of insolvency).

Therefore, as a general rule, insolvency proceedings are not compatible with other
enforcement proceedings. When compatible, in order to protect the interests of the debtor
and creditors, the Spanish Insolvency Law extends the jurisdiction of the court dealing with
insolvency proceedings, which is then legally authorized to handle any enforcement
proceedings or interim measures affecting the debtor’s assets (whether based upon civil, labor
or administrative law).

Creditors holding security over an asset of the insolvent party may seek its enforcement after
the declaration of insolvency, unless the asset over which security is created is considered
‘‘necessary’’ for its business activities. In that case, creditors may seek to obtain a declaration of
the Insolvency Judge confirming that the relevant asset is not considered ‘‘necessary’’ for its
business activities.

Otherwise, they will not be able to seek enforcement until a CVA is approved whose content
does not affect the exercise of this right, or until one year has elapsed from the declaration of
insolvency without an arrangement being approved or the liquidation stage having
commenced. Some courts consider, pursuant to Article 57.3 of the Spanish Insolvency Law, that
those secured creditors who did not commence enforcement prior to the declaration of
insolvency would lose their right to enforce the collateral separately within the insolvency
proceedings, even if one year has elapsed since the declaration of insolvency.

The one year moratorium does not apply to financial collateral considered as such under Royal
Decree 5/2005, dated 11 March. In any event, Royal Decree 5/2005 will not always be applicable
to financial collateral. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes.’’ Such moratorium does
not affect either to enforcement of collateral located in any other Member State (other than
Denmark) as of the date of the declaration of insolvency, as provided in Article 8 of the EU
Insolvency Regulations. Enforcement of collateral located in any other country in case of
insolvency is governed by the local Law of such country.

In the case of security, an enforcement proceeding may resume if the judge in charge of the
insolvency proceeding renders an order declaring that the secured asset is not necessary for the
debtor’s activity, and also once the one-year moratorium has elapsed and none of the
aforementioned scenarios have taken place.

However, once the liquidation stage has begun, secured creditors will not be able to initiate
separate enforcement proceedings (unless they had commenced the enforcement process
before the declaration of insolvency) and the secured asset will form part of the collective
enforcement proceeding although the proceeds obtained from the enforcement of the charged
asset will be paid to the relevant secured creditors, by applying the special rules set forth in
Articles 155 and 149.2 of the Spanish Insolvency Law, depending on the collateral being sold
individually or as part of a business unit on a going concern, respectively.

## Limitation on validity and enforcement of guarantees and collateral granted by any spanish guarantor

Under Spanish law, claims may become time-barred (five years being the general term
established for obligations in personam under Article 1,964 of the Spanish Civil Code (C´odigo
_Civil)) or may be or become subject to the defense of set-off or counterclaim._

The terms ‘‘enforceable,’’ ‘‘enforceability,’’ ‘‘valid,’’ ‘‘legal,’’ ‘‘binding’’ and ‘‘effective’’ (or any
combination thereof) mean that all of the obligations assumed by the relevant party under the

291


-----

relevant documents are of a type enforced by Spanish courts; the terms do not mean that
these obligations will necessarily be enforced in all circumstances in accordance with their
terms. Enforcement before the courts will in any event be subject to:

(i) the nature of the remedies available in the courts; and

(ii) the availability of defenses such as (without limitation) set-off (unless validly waived) or
counter-claim, circumvention of law (fraude de ley), abuse of rights (abuso de derecho),
misrepresentation, force majeure, unforeseen circumstances, undue influence, duress, and
abatement

In general terms, under Spanish law, any guarantee, pledge or mortgage must guarantee or
secure another obligation to which it is ancillary, which must be clearly identified in the
relevant guarantee or security agreement. Therefore, the guarantee or security interest follows
the underlying obligation in such a way that nullity of the underlying obligation entails nullity
of the guarantee or security and termination of the underlying obligation entails termination
of the guarantee or security. In the event that the security providers are able to prove that
there are no existing and valid guaranteed obligations, Spanish courts may consider that the
security providers’ obligations under the relevant guarantees or securities are not enforceable.

Following the amendment of paragraph 6 of section 1 article 90 of the Spanish Insolvency Law,
registering pledges over future credit rights (prenda de derechos de credito futuros) is only a
requirement for non-possessory liens. In the case of possessory pledges over future credit
rights, the pledge is valid in order to have a credit with a special privilege if it is documented
in a public document, if the future credit rights derive from agreements or juridical relations
that have been created prior to the declaration of insolvency, and (only in the case of credit
rights that derive from the termination of concession agreements), if the requirements
foreseen under Public Sector regulation are met.

Spanish law prohibits financial assistance within the meaning of Article 150 of the Spanish
Companies Act in relation to any Spanish guarantor incorporated or organized as a public
limited company (‘‘sociedad an´onima’’) under the laws of Spain or Article 143.2 of the Spanish
Companies Act in relation to any Spanish guarantor incorporated or organized as a private
limited liability company (‘‘sociedad limitada’’) under the laws of Spain. Therefore, any
guarantee, security or indemnity granted or assumed by the Spanish Guarantors shall not
extend to any payment obligation incurred for the purpose of acquiring the shares or
participations of such Guarantor or the shares of its direct or indirect parent company or, in the
case of a private limited liability company, of any company within its group. Guarantees,
security or indemnities granted in breach of financial assistance limitations can be considered
null and void, and can result in the imposition of fines to the relevant directors of the
companies committing the infraction. In particular, the Note Guarantees granted by
Empark,Dornier Estacionamientos Alh ´ondiga, Empark Andaluc´ıa, Aparcamientos de Bilbao and
Maksu, and the Collateral granted by Empark, Dornier and Maksu, will be limited to the value
of the Amended and Restated Debt Repayment Proceeds Loan and certain cash proceeds of the
Offering retained at Midco (which is expected in total to be approximately e460 million (except
that the secured amount under the Collateral over the issued and outstanding shares of
Emparque will, in connection with Portuguese stamp tax issues, be limited to a maximum
amount of e40 million.

All provisions of such Guarantee shall be construed accordingly in the sense that in no case can
any Guarantee or security given by the Guarantor secure repayment of the amounts used for
these purposes.

In addition, as regards those Spanish Guarantors that are incorporated as sociedad de
_responsabilidad limitada (initially Empark Andaluc´ıa and Maksu), it must be noted that,_
although the applicable legislation is unclear in this respect, the Note Guarantees granted by
such entities might be subject to the maximum amount applicable to the issuance of bonds by

292


-----

_sociedades de responsabilidad limitada pursuant to article 401 the Corporate Companies Act_
(such limit being equal to two times the own resources (recursos propios) of the relevant
Spanish Guarantor).

The security interests in the Collateral that will secure the obligations of the Issuer under the
Notes will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes but will be granted only in favor
of the Trustee. It should be noted that the concepts of trust and the parallel debt concept are
not recognized in Spain. The Indenture will provide (along with the Intercreditor Agreement)
that only the Security Agent has the right to enforce the Security and Guarantee Documents.
As a consequence, holders of the Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be
entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes, except
through the Trustee, who will (subject to the provisions of the Indenture and the Intercreditor
Agreement) provide instructions to the Security Agent in respect of the Collateral.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if enforcement of any security interest in Spain was to be
carried out by the Security Agent in Spain, it may be necessary (i) that each of the secured
parties benefiting from such Collateral prove its title to the secured obligations, ratify such
Collateral and accept the benefit of the security interest in their respective names and (ii) to
prove that the Security Agent is duly and expressly empowered by means of duly notarized
powers of attorney granted in favor of the Security Agent by each of the actual or future
creditors, if necessary, with the Apostille of The Hague Convention dated October 5, 1961.
Therefore, there could be a delay in the enforcement of the Collateral in Spain while the
Security Agent obtains such powers and the relevant public deeds as granted.

In the absence of the notarized and apostilled powers of attorney, the Security Agent may not
be able to enforce the relevant Spanish security interest on behalf of the holders of the Notes,
and there is a risk that the Security Agent would only be able to enforce the security interest
against the debt that it individually holds, and not for the full amount owed to creditors for
whom it may be acting as Security Agent. Further, those beneficial holders of the security who
have not accepted the security or duly empowered (by means of notarial and apostilled powers
of attorney) the Trustee or Security Agent to do so may be treated, from a Spanish law
perspective including without limitation in an insolvency scenario, as unsecured creditors.

Further, it is worth noting that there is a risk that the relevant court or notary public before
whom any Spanish security interest may eventually be enforced might request both the
notarization of the documents from which the relevant obligations arise, and the notarization
of each and every one of the transfer certificates regarding each and every transfer of the
Notes.

## Portuguese Insolvency Laws

Two of the Guarantors of the Notes are incorporated under the laws of Portugal. The
Portuguese insolvency law (approved by Decree-Law no. 53/2004, of March 18, and generally
termed CIRE (C´odigo da Insolvˆencia e da Recupera¸c˜ao de Empresas), as amended) governs court
insolvency proceedings, as opposed to out-of-court liquidation.

As a general rule insolvency proceedings governed by the CIRE are only available when the
debtor is unable to pay its debts as they fall due and are applicable to all persons and entities,
subject to certain exceptions, such as public entities, state-owned companies and insurance
companies, credit institutions, financial companies, investment companies, which render services
related with the holding of funds or securities on behalf of third parties, and collective
investment schemes to the extent that the submission to the insolvency proceeding would be
contradictory/incompatible with the special legal frameworks of such entities. These
proceedings may lead either to the restructuring of the business (by the approval of an
insolvency plan) or to the liquidation of the assets of the debtor. A debtor may apply for
insolvency proceedings when it finds itself unable to meet its obligations as they become due
or when it expects that it will shortly be unable to do so. In such cases, insolvency proceedings

293


-----

are available as a type of legal protection that the debtor may request in order to avoid the
seizure of its assets by its creditors. Where a debtor becomes insolvent, failing to meet its
current outstanding obligations on a regular basis, the debtor (or, in the case of a company, its
directors) is under a legal obligation to file for insolvency proceedings.

Please note that in the case of legal entities, the debtor is also considered to be in an
insolvency situation when, according to accounting criteria, the liabilities of the debtor clearly
exceed its assets (balance sheet test).

There are two types of claims for the purposes of the insolvency proceedings: the insolvency
claims (i.e. the debts to the creditors of the insolvent company, ‘‘d´ıvidas da insolvˆencia’’) and
the costs and debts of the insolvency estate (‘‘d´ıvidas da massa insolvente’’), including amongst
others, costs of the proceedings and remuneration of the insolvency administrator which are
paid prior to the insolvency claims.

Upon the issuance of a judgement opening the insolvency proceedings, the creditors of the
insolvent debtor (including secured creditors) have to lodge all of their claims against the
debtor, together with documentation to justify such claims, within a period set out in the
judgement of up to 30 days. Based on the documentation provided by the creditors and
documentation held by the debtor, the insolvency administrator draws up a list of approved
creditors and classifies them according to the categories established in the Law:

(a) Secured credits: credits secured by in rem guarantees (garantias reais) including special
statutory liens (privil´egios credit´orios especiais), up to the amount corresponding to the
value of the assets subject to the in rem guarantees or to the special statutory liens, for
example:

  - Real estate special statutory liens (for example, state credits related with real estate
property tax ‘‘IMI ‘‘);

  - Third parties credits (for example, mortgage, income assignment, pledge); and

  - Movable assets special statutory liens (for example, credits resulting from court expenses
incurred in the interest of the creditors)

(b) Privileged credits: credits secured by general statutory liens (privil´egios credit´orios gerais)
over assets integrated in the insolvency estate up to the amount corresponding to the
value of the assets subject to or the general statutory liens, for example:

  - Labor, tax and social security debts; and

  - Real estate general statutory liens.

(c) _Common credits: all credits not included in any other category._

(d) Subordinated credits: (classified as such by virtue of the underlying credit agreement or
pursuant to law). Subordinated credits include, among others, credits held by parties in
special relationships with the debtor, such as, in the case of an individual, credits held by
his/her relatives; in the case of a legal entity, credits held by the members of the
management body, group companies and controlling shareholders or shareholders in a
group relationship, including intercompany loans. Certain subordinated creditors are not
entitled to vote on the restructuring arrangement and usually subordinated creditors have
very limited chances of collection, as a result of the subordinated ranking established by
law.

The payment to creditors of the insolvent entity will be performed according to the credit
ranking, being firstly paid the secured credits, followed by privileged credits (in the event of
liquidation, they are the first to collect payment against the assets on which their debt is
secured or over which they have privileges in the order established by law), common credits
and finally subordinated credits. If the assets of the insolvency estate are insufficient to fully

294


-----

pay all creditors, the payment to common creditors will be made by apportionment amongst
all creditors and in proportion of their credits. The payment of subordinated credits will only
take place after full payment of common credits.

All creditors may be subject to restructuring arrangements. However, creditors can dispute the
restructuring arrangement by opposing the insolvency plan and claiming that they will be in a
worse position than if the restructuring plan was not approved. Please note that payments
described above are discounted for the debts of the insolvency estate (the ‘‘d´ıvidas da massa
_insolvente’’)._

Insolvency proceedings are not compatible with other enforcement proceedings filed, or to be
filed against the debtor.

The CIRE provides that, upon the insolvency of a debtor, acts entered into or omitted within
the two years prior to the beginning of the insolvency proceeding may be cancelled in favor of
the insolvency estate if they: (i) are detrimental to the insolvency estate (i.e., actions that
reduce, frustrate, obstruct, jeopardize or delay the payment of the insolvency claims), and
(ii) have been carried out in bad faith;. The insolvency administrator has six months to cancel
these actions from the moment it becomes aware of them, but may, as a rule, never do so
after a two year period has elapsed from the declaration of insolvency. Bad faith for these
purposes is the knowledge, as of the date of the transaction in question, that (i) the debtor
was insolvent, (ii) insolvency proceedings had been filed against the debtor or (iii) the
transaction in question would be detrimental to the creditors of the debtor and such debtor
was in an imminent insolvency. There is a rebuttable presumption of ‘‘bad faith’’ if the
transaction is entered into within the two years prior to the commencement of insolvency
proceedings and is made with certain related parties.

As an exception to the above rules, article 121 of the CIRE identifies certain actions that are
automatically (iuris et de iure) considered as detrimental to the insolvency estate and that may
be cancelled irrespective of bad faith. These actions include (i) acts entered into by the debtor
within the two years prior to the beginning of the insolvency proceedings which can be
qualified as a gratuity; (ii) payments or other forms of debt extinction made in the six month
period prior to the commencement of the insolvency proceedings and carried out in terms
which are not market standard and that the creditor could not demand; (iii) payments or other
forms of debt extinction made before the relevant credits had become due and that occurred
in the six month period prior to the commencement of the insolvency procedure or after such
commencement but before the credits had become due; (iv) granting in rem security interests
(garantias reais) to pre-existing credits or others that replace them in the six month period
prior to the commencement of the insolvency procedure; (v) granting in rem security interests
(garantias reais) simultaneously with the creation of the secured obligation in the 60 day
period prior to the commencement of the insolvency procedure; (vi) granting personal
guarantees in the six month period prior to the commencement of the insolvency procedure
that do not relate to business transactions with a real interest to the debtor;
(vii) reimbursement of shareholder’s loans (‘‘suprimentos’’) occurred during the year before the
beginning of the insolvency proceedings; (viii) actions and transactions carried out in the year
prior to the beginning of the insolvency proceedings, in which the debtor’s obligations clearly
exceed those of the other party.

Under Portuguese law there is no legal concept of ‘‘trustee’’ or ‘‘parallel debt’’ and its use in
the context of an insolvency proceeding subject to the CIRE may be disputed as (i) it may lead
to argue that the holders of the Notes should not be ranked as guaranteed creditors since they
do not have direct secured claims (as security was granted to the Security Agent), (ii) the
holder of the Notes may not have the ability to directly enforce the security interest, (iii) there
is a risk that the Security Agent would only be able to enforce the security interest against the
debt that it individually holds, and not for the full amount owed to creditors for whom it may
be acting as Security Agent and (iv) a Portuguese insolvency court may decide not to enforce
the terms of intercreditor agreements, when allocating the proceeds, as in such allocation the
court is bound to comply with the rules set forth by the CIRE.

295


-----

_Recovery procedure_
The recovery procedure (hereinafter ‘‘PER ‘‘) established in the CIRE aims to allow a company
debtor in financial difficulties or in an imminent insolvency situation but whose recovery is still
possible, to reach an agreement with its creditors in an attempt to restructure and preserve the
business.

The main aim of the PER is to allow the recovery of a company when that is deemed to be
possible.

When a company files for a PER, this prevents any proceedings to collect debts being brought
against such company and, while the negotiations are on-going, it suspends any proceedings to
collect debts against the company that are still pending. If a recovery plan is approved the
proceedings against the company to collect debts are extinguished, unless otherwise provided
in the plan.

Additionally, when a company files for a PER, it suspends any proceedings against it seeking its
insolvency declaration, save if a declaration of insolvency has already been issued by the
competent court The PER procedure starts with a written declaration signed by the company
and by at least one of its creditors (not being necessary for it to be the main creditor but must
be holder of at least 10% of the non-subordinated credits of the company) stating that the
company intends to enter into negotiations with the creditors with a view to its revitalization
by the approval of a recovery plan and demonstrating that the company fulfils the
requirements for the PER to be granted evidenced by an independent auditor report.

If the recovery plan is approved by the legally prescribed majorities of creditors, the judge may
then ratify it or not.

The court’s ratification decision binds all creditors, even those that have not participated or
approved in the negotiations. Moreover, the court’s decision puts an end to any suspended
debt collection actions, except when the plan expressly states otherwise.

If the company or a majority of its creditors conclude, in advance, that it is not possible to
reach an agreement or an agreement is not achieved by the deadline for concluding the
negotiations, the negotiating process is terminated. If the company is not yet in an insolvency
situation, the PER is brought to an end and its effects are extinguished. Should the company be
already in an insolvency situation, the PER proceeding will be converted into an insolvency
proceeding (as detailed above).

_Extrajudicial agreement_
Further to the main PER procedure abovementioned, the Portuguese insolvency law also sets
forth another sub-type of recovery procedure which is initiated with the execution of a
recovery plan by way of an agreement negotiated and concluded before the judicial procedure
by and between the company and some (or all) of its creditors, that is brought to the court for
ratification, as defined by law.

## Luxembourg Insolvency Laws

The Notes will be issued by the Issuer, which is a private liability company (soci´et´e `a
_responsabilit´e limit´ee), incorporated under Luxembourg law, with its registered office at 15,_
Boulevard F.W. Raiffeisen, L—2411 Luxembourg, Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and is registered
with the Luxembourg Register of Commerce and Companies under number B218297 and will
be guaranteed by the Parent Guarantor (the ‘‘Luxembourg Guarantor ‘‘). Under Luxembourg
insolvency laws, your ability to receive payments of interest and principal on the Notes and
under the Note Guarantees, may be more limited than would be the case under U.S. or other
bankruptcy laws. Luxembourg courts should have, in principle, jurisdiction to open main
insolvency proceedings with respect to the Issuer and the Luxembourg Guarantor, as entities,
having their respective registered office, central administration (administration centrale) and

296


-----

COMI, as used in the EU Insolvency Regulation, in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, such
proceedings to be governed by Luxembourg insolvency laws. According to article 3(1) of the EU
Insolvency Regulation, there is a rebuttable presumption that a company has its COMI in the
jurisdiction in which it has the place of its registered office. As a result, there is a rebuttable
presumption that the COMI of the Issuer and the Luxembourg Guarantor is in the Grand Duchy
of Luxembourg and consequently that any ‘‘main insolvency proceedings’’ (as defined in the EU
Insolvency Regulation) would be opened by a Luxembourg court and be governed by
Luxembourg law. Under Luxembourg law, the following types of proceedings (together
referred to as insolvency proceedings) may be opened against a company (i) having its COMI in
Luxembourg, or (ii) if its place of central administration (administration centrale) is in
Luxembourg:

(i) Bankruptcy proceedings (faillite), the opening of which may be requested by the
Luxembourg company, by any of its creditors or by the courts ex officio. Following such a
request, the Luxembourg courts having jurisdiction may open bankruptcy proceedings if
the Luxembourg company (i) is in a state of cessation of payments (cessation des
_paiements) and (ii) has lost its commercial creditworthiness (´ebranlement du cr´edit). The_
main effect of such proceedings is the sale of the assets and allocation of the proceeds of
such sale between creditors taking into account their rank of privilege, as well as the
suspension of all measures of enforcement against the company, except, subject to certain
limited exceptions, for enforcement by secured creditors, such as secured creditors enjoying
a financial collateral arrangement falling within the scope of the Collateral Act 2005, and
the payment of the secured creditors in accordance with their rank upon realization of the
assets. In addition, the managers or directors of a Luxembourg company that ceases its
payments (i.e. is unable to pay its debts as they fall due with normal means of payment)
must within one month of them having become aware of the company’s cessation of
payments, file a petition for bankruptcy (faillite) with the court clerk of the district court
of the company’s registered office. If the managers or directors fail to comply with such
provision they may be held (i) liable towards the company or any third parties on the basis
of principles of managers’ / directors’ liability for any loss suffered and (ii) criminally liable
for simple bankruptcy (banqueroute simple) in accordance with article 574 of the
Luxembourg commercial code.

(ii) Controlled management proceedings (gestion contrˆol´ee), the opening of which may only
be requested by the company and not by its creditors and under which a Luxembourg
court may order the provisional stay of enforcement of claims except for certain secured
creditors (see the below applicable provisions of the Collateral Act 2005); or

(iii) Composition with creditors proceedings (concordat pr´eventif de la faillite), which may be
requested only by the company (subject to obtaining prior consent of the majority of its
creditors representing at least three-quarters of its debts) and not by its creditors directly.
The Luxembourg court’s decision to admit a company to the composition proceedings
triggers a provisional stay on enforcement of claims by creditors except for certain secured
creditors (see the below applicable provisions of the Collateral Act 2005).

(iv) In addition to the proceedings described above, your ability to receive payment on the
Notes and the Note Guarantees may be affected by a decision of a Luxembourg court to
grant a stay on payments (sursis de paiements) or to put a Luxembourg company into
judicial liquidation (liquidation judiciaire). Judicial liquidation proceedings may be opened
at the request of the public prosecutor against companies pursuing an activity violating
criminal laws, or that are in serious breach or in violation of the Luxembourg commercial
code or of the Luxembourg law dated 10 August 1915 on commercial companies, as
amended (the ‘‘Luxembourg Companies Law ‘‘). The management of such liquidation
proceedings will generally follow the rules applicable to Luxembourg bankruptcy
proceedings.

297


-----

The Issuer’s liabilities in respect of the Notes and the Luxembourg Guarantor’s liabilities in
respect of the Note Guarantees will, in the event of a liquidation of the Issuer following, in
particular, bankruptcy or judicial liquidation proceedings, only rank after the cost of liquidation
(including any debt incurred for the purpose of such liquidation) and any claims that are
preferred under Luxembourg law.

Preferential claims under Luxembourg law include, among others:

(i) amounts owed to the Luxembourg Revenue;

(ii) value added tax and other taxes and duties owed to the Luxembourg Customs and Excise;

(iii) employees’ and employer’s social security contributions;

(iv) landlord, pledgor not under the Collateral Act 2005; and

(v) remuneration owed to employees (last six months’ wages amounting to a maximum of six
times the minimum social salary).

For the avoidance of doubt, the above list is not exhaustive.

Assets over which a security interest has been granted will, in principle, not be available for
distribution to unsecured creditors (except after enforcement and, only to the extent a surplus
is realized, and subject to preferential claims, liens and privileges arising under mandatorily
law, if any).

Article 20 of the Collateral Act 2005 provides that Luxembourg law collateral arrangements
(pledges, transfers of title by way of security and repo agreements) over claims and financial
instruments falling within the scope of the Collateral Act 2005, as well as all enforcement
measures and valuation and enforcement measures agreed upon by the parties in accordance
with that law, are valid and enforceable, even if entered into during the hardening period,
against third parties, commissioners, receivers, liquidators and other similar persons
notwithstanding the insolvency proceedings.

Article 24 of the Collateral Act 2005 provides that foreign law security interests over claims or
financial instruments granted by a Luxembourg pledgor will be valid and enforceable as a
matter of Luxembourg law notwithstanding any Luxembourg insolvency proceedings, if such
foreign law security interests are similar in nature to a Luxembourg security interest falling
within the scope of the Collateral Act 2005. If Article 24 applies, Luxembourg preference period
rules do not apply (save the case of fraud).

Article 21(2) of the Collateral Act 2005 provides that where a financial collateral arrangement
has been entered into after the opening of liquidation proceedings or the coming into force of
reorganization measures or the entry into force of such measures, such arrangement is
enforceable against third parties, administrators, insolvency receivers, liquidators and other
similar persons if the collateral taker proves that it was unaware of the fact that such
proceedings had been opened or that such measures had been taken or that it could not
reasonably be aware of such proceedings, measures or arrangement.

**_Impact of insolvency proceedings on transactions_**
During such insolvency proceedings, all enforcement measures by unsecured creditors are
suspended. Other than as described above in respect of the provisions of the Collateral Act
2005, the ability of secured creditors to enforce their security interests may also be limited, in
particular in the event of controlled management proceedings expressly providing that the
rights of certain secured creditors are frozen until a final decision has been taken by a
Luxembourg court as to the petition for controlled management and may be affected
thereafter by any reorganization order given by the court. A reorganization order requires the

298


-----

prior approval by more than 50% of the creditors representing more than 50% of a
Luxembourg company’s liabilities in order to take effect.

Furthermore, you should note that declarations of default and any subsequent acceleration
(such as acceleration upon the occurrence of an event of default) will not be enforceable
during controlled management proceedings. However, during such controlled management
proceedings a notice of default may still be served.

Luxembourg insolvency laws may also affect transactions entered into or payments made by
the Issuer during the preference period (p´eriode suspecte) which is a maximum of six months
as from the date on which the Commercial Court formally adjudicates a company bankrupt,
and, as for specific payments and transactions, during an additional period of ten days before
the commencement of such period preceding the judgment declaring bankruptcy, except that
in certain specific situations the court may set the start of the suspect period at an earlier date,
if the bankruptcy judgment was preceded by another insolvency proceedings (e.g., a suspension
of payments or controlled management proceedings) under Luxembourg law. In particular:

(i) pursuant to article 445 of the Luxembourg code of commerce (Code de Commerce),
specified transactions (such as, in particular, the granting of a security interest for
antecedent debts save in respect of financial collateral arrangements within the meaning
of the Collateral Act 2005; payment of debts which have not fallen due, whether payment
is made in cash or by way of assignment, sale, set-off or by any other means; the payment
of debts which have fallen due by any means other than in cash or by bill of exchange; the
sale of assets without consideration or with substantially inadequate consideration)
entered into during the preference period (or the ten days preceding it) must be set aside
or declared null and void, if so requested by the insolvency receiver; article 445 does not
apply for financial collateral arrangements such as Luxembourg law pledges over shares,
accounts or receivables and set- off arrangements falling within the scope of the Collateral
Act 2005;

(ii) pursuant to article 446 of the Luxembourg code of commerce, payments made for matured
debts as well as other transactions (save financial collateral arrangements within the
meaning of the Collateral Act 2005) concluded for consideration during the preference
period are subject to cancellation by the court upon proceedings instituted by the
insolvency receiver if they were concluded with the knowledge of the bankrupt party’s
cessation of payments; article 446 does not apply for financial collateral arrangements,
such as Luxembourg law pledges over shares, accounts or receivables and set-off
arrangements falling within the scope of the Collateral Act 2005; and

(iii) pursuant to article 448 of the Luxembourg code of commerce and article 1167 of the
Luxembourg civil code (action paulienne), the insolvency receiver (acting on behalf of the
creditors) has the right to challenge any fraudulent payments and transactions, including
the granting of security with an intent to defraud, made prior to the bankruptcy, without
any time limit.

In principle, a bankruptcy order rendered by a Luxembourg court does not result in the
automatic termination of contracts except for intuitu personae agreements, that is, contracts
for which the identity of the company or its solvency were crucial (such as employment
agreements and powers of attorney). The contracts, therefore, subsist after the bankruptcy
order. However, the bankruptcy receiver may choose to terminate certain contracts so as to
avoid worsening the financial situation of the company. As of the date of adjudication of
bankruptcy, no interest on any unsecured claim will accrue vis-`a-vis the bankruptcy estate.
Insolvency proceedings may hence have a material adverse effect on Luxembourg company’s
business and assets and Luxembourg company’s respective obligations under the Notes.

Finally, international aspects of Luxembourg bankruptcy, controlled management or
composition proceedings may be subject to the EU Insolvency Regulation. In particular, rights in

299


-----

rem over assets located in another jurisdiction where the EU Insolvency Regulation will not be
affected by the opening of insolvency proceedings, without prejudice however to the
applicability of rules relating to the voidness, voidability or unenforceability of legal acts
detrimental to all the creditors (subject to the application of article 24 of the Collateral Act
2005 as described above and article 16 of the EU Insolvency Regulation).

## Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests in Luxembourg

According to Luxembourg conflict of law rules, Luxembourg courts will generally apply, in
relation to the creation, perfection and enforcement of security interests over the assets subject
to such security interests, the law of the place where such assets subject are situated (lex rei
_sitae). As a consequence, Luxembourg law will apply in relation to the creation, perfection and_
enforcement of security interests over assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg,
such as registered shares in Luxembourg companies, cash bank accounts held with a
Luxembourg bank, receivables/claims having debtors located in Luxembourg and/or governed
by Luxembourg law, securities which are held through an account located (or deemed to be
located) in Luxembourg and bearer securities physically held in Luxembourg.

If certain assets are located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg, the security interests over
such assets will be governed by Luxembourg law and must be created, perfected and enforced
in accordance with Luxembourg law. The creation, validity and enforcement of security
interests such as pledges and transfer of ownership as security, granted on financial instruments
and claims (in order to secure cash settlement and/or delivery of financial instruments) are
notably subject to the Collateral Act 2005. Pursuant to the Collateral Act 2005, a pledge (gage)
is effected by a transfer of possession of the pledged assets to the pledgee or to a third party
acting as depository for the pledgee and the pledgee’s preference rights over the pledged
assets only remain in existence as long as the pledgee or the depository remains in possession
of such assets.

Under the Collateral Act 2005, the perfection of pledges depends on certain registration,
notification and acceptance requirements. A share pledge over registered shares in a
Luxembourg company must be acknowledged and accepted by the company which has issued
the shares (that are pledged) and, as a perfection requirement, be registered in the
shareholders’ register of that company. If future shares are pledged, the perfection of such
pledge will require additional registration in the shareholders’ register of the company
concerned. A pledge over receivables will be validly created and perfected provided that the
receivables pledge agreement is executed by all the parties thereto. However, if the debtor has
not been notified of the receivables pledge or if it did not otherwise acquire knowledge of the
pledge, it will be validly discharged of its obligations if it pays the pledgor. A bank account
pledge agreement must be notified to and accepted by the account bank so as to ensure that
the account bank has waived any pre-existing security interests and other rights in respect of
the pledged account. If (future) bank accounts are pledged, such additional notification to,
acceptance and waiver by the account bank will be required.

The above perfection steps and actions need to be undertaken by the grantor of the security
interest and/or the Security Agent. If the relevant pledgor or the Security Agent fail or are
unable to take the necessary steps/actions required to take or perfect any of the abovementioned security interests, such security interests will not have been created and/or perfected
with respect to the claims arising under the Notes. Absent perfection, the Security Agent may
have difficulty enforcing its rights in the Collateral with regard to third parties, including a
trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in the same collateral.
Finally, since the ranking of pledges is determined by the date on which they became
enforceable against third parties, a security interest created on a later date over the same
Collateral, but which comes into force as against third parties earlier (by way of
accomplishment of the relevant perfection requirements) has priority.

300


-----

Article 11 of the Collateral Act 2005 sets out the following enforcement methods, available
upon the occurrence of the relevant enforcement event in respect of a pledge governed by
Luxembourg law (subject to certain specifications depending on the nature of the pledged
assets):

(i) appropriation by the pledgee or appropriation by a third party of the pledged assets at
(i) a value determined (before or after appropriation) in accordance with a valuation
method agreed upon by the parties or (ii) the listing price of the pledged assets (if the
pledged assets are listed on an official Luxembourg or foreign stock market or traded on a
recognized regulated market open to the public);

(ii) selling or causing the sale of the pledged assets (i) in a private transaction at commercially
reasonable terms (conditions commerciales normales), (ii) by a public sale at the stock
exchange, or (iii) by way of a public auction;

(iii) court allocation of the pledged assets to the pledgee in discharge of the secured
obligations following a valuation made by a court-appointed expert; or

(iv) set-off between the secured obligations and the pledged assets.

As the Collateral Act 2005 does not provide any specific time periods and depending on (i) the
method chosen, (ii) the valuation of the pledged assets, (iii) any possible recourses, and (iv) the
possible need to involve third parties, such as, e.g., courts, stock exchanges and appraisers, the
enforcement of the security interests might be delayed. No legal proceedings are required for
most enforcements methods.

Foreign law governed security interests and the powers of any receivers/administrators may not
be enforceable in respect of assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg. Security
interests/arrangements, which are not expressly recognized under Luxembourg law and the
powers of any receivers/administrators may not be recognized or enforced by the Luxembourg
courts, in particular where the Luxembourg security grantor becomes subject to Luxembourg
insolvency proceedings or where the Luxembourg courts otherwise have jurisdiction because of
the actual or deemed location of the relevant rights or assets, except if ‘‘main insolvency
proceedings’’ (as defined in the EU Insolvency Regulation) are opened under Luxembourg law
and such security interests/arrangements constitute rights in rem over assets located in another
Member State in which the EU Insolvency Regulation applies, and in accordance of article 5 of
the EU Insolvency Regulation.

The perfection of the security interests created pursuant to the pledge agreements does not
prevent any third party creditor from seeking attachment or execution against the assets,
which are subject to the security interests created under the pledge agreements, to satisfy their
unpaid claims against the pledgor. Such creditor may seek the forced sale of the assets of the
pledgors through court proceedings, although the beneficiaries of the pledges will in principle
remain entitled in priority to the proceeds of such sale (subject to preferred rights by operation
of law).

When a Luxembourg company grants guarantees and/or security interests, applicable corporate
procedures normally entail that the decision be approved by a board resolution or by the
decision of delegates that have been appointed for such purpose. In addition, the granting of
the envisaged guarantees and/or security interests must comply with the Luxembourg
company’s corporate object.

The proposed action by the company must be ‘‘in the corporate interest of the company,’’
which is a translation of the French ‘‘int´erˆet social,’’ an equivalent term to the English legal
concept of corporate benefit. The concept of ‘‘corporate interest’’ is not defined by law, but
has been developed by doctrine and court precedents and may be described as being ‘‘the limit
of acceptable corporate behavior.’’

301


-----

Whereas the previous discussions regarding the limits of corporate power are based on
objective criteria (provisions of law and of the articles of association), the concept of corporate
benefit requires a subjective judgment. In a group context, the interest of the companies of
the group taken individually is not entirely eliminated.

Although the existence of a corporate interest in the granting of a guarantee or a security
interest on a group level is certainly important, the mere existence of such a group interest
does not compensate for a lack of corporate interest for one or more of the companies of the
group taken individually. The concept of corporate benefit is of particular importance in the
context of misuse of corporate assets provided by Article 1500-11 of the Luxembourg
Companies Law.

The failure to comply with the corporate benefit requirement will typically result in liability
(personal and/or criminal) for the directors or managers of the guarantor concerned. The
guarantees or security interests granted by a Luxembourg company could themselves be held
void or unenforceable if their granting is contrary to Luxembourg public policy (ordre public).
It should be stressed that, as is the case with all criminal offenses addressed by the Luxembourg
Company Law, a director or a manager of a company will in general be prosecuted for misuse
of corporate assets only if someone has lodged a complaint with the public prosecutor. This
person may be an interested third party, e.g., a creditor, a minority shareholder, a liquidator or
an insolvency receiver. In addition, it cannot be excluded that the public prosecutor could act
on its own initiative if the existence of such a misuse of corporate assets became known to it.
If there is a misuse of corporate assets criminally sanctioned by court, then this could, under
general principles of law, have the effect that contracts concluded in breach of Article 1500-11
of the Luxembourg Companies Law will be held null and void. The criteria mentioned above
have to be applied on a case-by-case basis, and a subjective, fact-based judgment is required to
be made, by the directors or managers of the Luxembourg company. As a result of the above
developments, the guarantees or security interests granted by a Luxembourg company will be
subject to certain limitations, which will take the form of general limitation language (limiting
the guarantee obligations of such Luxembourg company to a certain percentage of, inter alia,
its net assets (capitaux propres) and certain intra-group liabilities), which is inserted in the
relevant finance document(s), indenture or guarantee agreements and which covers the
aggregate obligations and exposure of the relevant Luxembourg company under all finance
documents, indenture or guarantee agreements.

The registration of the Notes, the security interest agreements, the Indenture, the Note
Guarantees and the transaction documents is required if such security interest agreements, the
Indenture, the Note Guarantees and the transaction documents are either (i) attached as an
annex to an act (annex´es `a un acte) that itself is subject to mandatory registration or
(ii) deposited in the minutes of a notary (d´epos´es au rang des minutes d’un notaire). In such
cases, as well as in case of a voluntary registration, the security interest agreements, the
Indenture, the Note Guarantees and the transaction documents will be subject to registration
duties payable by the party registering, or being ordered to register, the security interest
agreements, the Indenture, the Note Guarantees and the transaction documents. Depending on
the nature of the security interest agreements, the Indenture, the Note Guarantees and the
transaction documents, such registration duties would be ad valorem (such as for instance a
registration duty of 0.24% calculated on the amounts mentioned in those agreements) or fixed
(such as for instance a registration duty of e12 for a pledge).

The Luxembourg courts or the official Luxembourg authority may require (when these are
presented before them) that the notes, the security interest agreements, the indenture, the
guarantees and the transaction documents (and any document in connection therewith) and
any judgment obtained in a foreign court be partially or fully translated into French, German
or Luxembourgish.

# Tax Considerations

## Automatic Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes

Council Directive 2011/16/EU on Administrative Cooperation in the field of Taxation provides
for, amongst other things, the implementation by EU member states of the automatic
exchange of information in respect of various categories of income and capital and broadly
encompasses the regime known as the Common Reporting Standard (hereinafter, CRS)
proposed by the OECD as a new global standard for the automatic exchange of information
between tax authorities in participating jurisdictions.

Under the CRS, governments of participating jurisdictions (currently more than 100
jurisdictions) are required to collect detailed information to be shared with other jurisdictions
annually. All EU member states have implemented the CRS.

The Issuer will be required to obtain and report to revenue commissioners annually certain
financial account and other information for all new and existing accountholders in respect of
their Notes. The information will include amongst other things, details of the name, address,
taxpayer identification number (‘‘TIN ‘‘), place of residence and, in the case of accountholders
who are individuals, the date and place of birth, together with details relating to payments
made to accountholders and their holdings. This information may be shared with tax
authorities in other EU member states (and in certain other countries subject to the terms of
information exchange agreements entered into with those countries) and jurisdictions which
implement the CRS.

## Luxembourg Tax Considerations

This section describes certain Luxembourg taxation principles that may be relevant to holders
with respect to their investment in the Notes. Unless otherwise indicated, all information
contained in this section is based on laws, regulations, practice and decisions in effect in
Luxembourg at the date of this offering memorandum. Any changes could apply retroactively
and could affect the continued validity of this summary.

This section does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all potential Luxembourg
tax considerations that may be relevant to a decision to invest in, own or dispose of the Notes
and is not intended as tax advice to any particular investor. This information also does not take
into account the specific circumstances of particular investors. Each investor should consult its
own tax advisor about the tax consequences of investing in, holding or disposing of the Notes
(including receiving interest and redeeming the Notes) under state, local or foreign laws,
including Luxembourg tax law, to which they may be subject.

This section does not describe any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, locality
or other taxing jurisdiction other than Luxembourg.

This section assumes that each transaction with respect to the Notes is, and will be, at arm’s
length.

The residence concept used below applies for Luxembourg income tax assessment purposes
only. Any reference in the present section to a tax, duty, levy, impost or other charge or
withholding of a similar nature refers to Luxembourg tax law and/or concepts only. Corporate
income tax (impˆot sur le revenu des collectivit´es), municipal business tax (impˆot commercial
_communal) as well as the solidarity surcharge invariably apply to most corporate taxpayers_
resident in Luxembourg for tax purposes. Luxembourg tax resident corporate investors may
further be subject to net wealth tax (impˆot sur la fortune). Luxembourg tax resident individual
taxpayers are generally subject to personal income tax and the solidarity surcharge. Under
certain circumstances, where an individual taxpayer acts in the course of the management of a
professional or business undertaking, municipal business tax may apply as well.

-----

**_A)_** **_Tax residency_**
A holder of Notes will not become resident, nor be deemed to be resident, in Luxembourg by
reason only of the holding of the Notes, or the execution, performance, delivery and/or
enforcement of the Notes.

**_B)_** **_Luxembourg withholding tax on the Notes_**
Under Luxembourg tax law currently in effect and subject to the Luxembourg law of
December 23, 2005, as amended (the ‘‘Law ‘‘), all payments of interest (including accrued but
unpaid interest) and principal made by the Issuer in the context of the holding, disposal,
redemption or repurchase of the Notes, which are not profit sharing, can be made free and
clear of any withholding or deduction for or on account of any taxes of whatsoever nature
imposed, levied, withheld, or assessed by Luxembourg or any political subdivision or taxing
authority thereof or therein, in accordance with the applicable Luxembourg law.

Under the Law a 20% withholding tax (the ‘‘20% Tax ‘‘) is levied on interest payments made by
a paying agent established in Luxembourg (within the meaning of the Law) to Luxembourg
resident individuals.

Pursuant to the Law, Luxembourg resident individuals, acting in the course of their private
wealth, can opt to self-declare and pay a 20% levy (the ‘‘20% Levy’’) on interest payments
made by paying agents established in a European Union Member State (other than
Luxembourg) or a Member State of the European Economic Area (other than Luxembourg).

The 20% Tax as described above or the 20% Levy are final when Luxembourg resident
individuals are acting the context of the management of their private wealth.

Responsibility for the withholding of tax in application of the Law, is assumed by the
Luxembourg paying agent within the meaning of the Law (in the case of the 20% Tax) and by
the Luxembourg resident holder of the Notes (in the case of the 20% Levy).

Payment of interest under the Notes coming within the scope of the Law will be subject to the
20% Tax or to the 20% Levy, as the case may be.

**_C)_** **_Luxembourg taxation of the holders of Notes_**

_Taxation of non-Luxembourg residents_
Holders of Notes who are non-residents of Luxembourg and who have neither a permanent
establishment, nor a permanent representative nor a fixed base of business in Luxembourg
with which/whom the holding of the Notes is connected are not liable to pay any Luxembourg
income tax, whether they receive payments of principal, payments of interest (including
accrued but unpaid interest), payments received upon the redemption, repurchase or exchange
of the Notes, or realize capital gains on the sale of any Notes.

Non-Luxembourg resident corporate holders of Notes or non-Luxembourg resident individual
holders of Notes acting in the course of the management of a professional or business
undertaking, that have a permanent establishment or permanent representative in
Luxembourg to which or to whom such Notes are attributable, are subject to Luxembourg
income tax on interest accrued or received, redemption premiums or issue discounts, under the
Notes and on any gains realized upon the sale or disposal, in any form whatsoever, of the
Notes.

_Taxation of luxembourg residents_
## Luxembourg Resident Individuals

Luxembourg resident individual holders of Notes, acting in the course of the management of
their private wealth, are subject to Luxembourg income tax at progressive rates in respect of
interest received, redemption premiums or issue discounts under the Notes, except if the 20%

304


-----

Tax has been levied by a Luxembourg paying agent on such payments or, in case of a
non-resident paying agent, if they have opted to self-declare and pay the 20% Levy. The 20%
Tax or the 20% Levy represent the final tax liability on interest received for Luxembourg
resident individual holders of Notes receiving the payment in the course of the management of
their private wealth and can be reduced in consideration of foreign withholding tax, based on
double tax treaties concluded by Luxembourg.

Luxembourg resident individual holders of Notes receiving interest as business income must
include interest income in their taxable basis. If applicable, the 20% Tax levied will be credited
against their final income tax liability.

Luxembourg resident individual holders of Notes are not subject to taxation on capital gains
upon the disposal of the Notes owned in the framework of the management of their private
wealth, unless (i) the disposal of the Notes precedes the acquisition of the Notes, or (ii) the
Notes are disposed of within six months of their date of acquisition. Upon redemption/sale of
the Notes, the portion of the redemption/sales price corresponding to accrued but unpaid
interest will be subject to the 20% Tax or to the 20% Levy. The 20% Tax or the 20% Levy
represent the final tax liability for Luxembourg resident individual holders of Notes receiving
the payment in the course of the management of their private wealth. Luxembourg resident
individual holders of Notes receiving the interest as business income must include the portion
of the redemption/sales price corresponding to this interest in their taxable income. The 20%
Tax levied will be credited against their final income tax liability.

## Luxembourg Resident Companies

Luxembourg resident company (soci´et´es de capitaux) holders of Notes or foreign entities of the
same type which have a permanent establishment or a permanent representative in
Luxembourg with which the holding of the Notes is connected, must include in their taxable
income any interest income (including accrued but unpaid interest) and, on disposal or taxable
conversion of the Notes, the difference between the sales price (including accrued but unpaid
interest) and the lower of the cost and book value of the Notes sold or converted.

## Luxembourg Resident Companies Benefiting from a Special Tax Regime

Luxembourg resident company holders of Notes which are companies benefiting from a special
tax regime, such as, for example (i) family estate management companies subject to the Law of
May 11, 2007, as amended, (ii) specialized investment funds subject to the Law of February 13,
2007, as amended, (iii) undertakings for collective investment subject to the Law of
December 17, 2010, as amended or (iv) reserved alternative investment funds subject to the law
of July 23, 2016, as amended, (which benefit from the tax regime applicable to specialized
investment funds) are neither subject to Luxembourg income tax in respect of interest accrued
or received, any redemption premium or issue discount, nor on gains realized on the sale or
disposal, in any form whatsoever, of the Notes.

**_D)_** **_Luxembourg net wealth tax_**
An individual holder of Notes, whether he/she is resident of Luxembourg or not, should not be
subject to Luxembourg wealth tax on such Notes.

Luxembourg net wealth tax will not be levied on a corporate holder of Notes, unless:

(i) such holder of Notes is, or is deemed to be a fully taxable Luxembourg resident company
for the purpose of the relevant provisions and is not a holder of Notes governed by (a) the
law of December 17, 2010, as amended, on undertakings for collective investment or
(b) the law of March 22, 2004, as amended, on securitization, or (c) the law of June 15,
2004, as amended, on the investment company in risk capital, or (d) the law of May 11,
2007, as amended, on family estate management companies or (e) the law of July 13, 2005,

305


-----

as amended, on professional pension institutions or (f) the law of February 13, 2007, as
amended, on specialized investment funds or (g) the law of July 23, 2016, as amended, on
reserved alternative investment funds; or

(ii) the Notes are attributable to an enterprise or part thereof which is carried on by a
non-resident company in Luxembourg through a permanent establishment, a permanent
representative or a fixed place of business.

Please note that securitization companies governed by the law of March 22, 2004, as amended,
on securitization, capital companies governed by the law of June 15, 2004, as amended, on
venture capital vehicles or reserved alternative investment funds governed by the law of
July 23, 2016 (which fall under the special tax regime set out under article 48 thereof) may,
under certain conditions, be subject to minimum net wealth tax.

**_E)_** **_Other Luxembourg taxes_**
There is no Luxembourg registration tax, stamp duty or any other similar tax or duty payable in
Luxembourg by holders of Notes as a consequence of the issuance of the Notes, nor will any of
these taxes be payable as a consequence of a subsequent transfer, repurchase or redemption of
the Notes.

However, a fixed or ad valorem registration duty may be due upon the registration of the
Notes in Luxembourg (i) in the case of voluntary registration of the Notes or any documents
relating to the Notes, (ii) in the case where the Notes or any document relating to the Notes
are appended to a document that requires mandatory registration or in the case such
documents are deposited in the minutes of a notary (d´epos´es au rang des minutes d’un
_notaire)._

There is no Luxembourg value added tax payable in respect of payments in consideration for
the issuance of the Notes or in respect of the payment of interest or principal under the Notes
or the transfer of the Notes.

Luxembourg value added tax may, however, be payable in respect of fees charged for certain
services rendered to the Issuer, if for Luxembourg value added tax purposes such services are
rendered or are deemed to be rendered in Luxembourg under the reverse-charge principle and
an exemption from Luxembourg value added tax does not apply with respect to such services.

No gift, estate or inheritance taxes are levied in Luxembourg on the transfer of the Notes upon
death of a holder of Notes in cases where the deceased was not a resident of Luxembourg for
inheritance tax purposes, or in the case of a gift, the gift is neither recorded in a Luxembourg
notarial deed nor registered in Luxembourg. However, where a holder of Notes is a resident of
Luxembourg for tax purposes at the time of his/her death, the Notes are included in his/her
taxable estate for inheritance tax assessment purposes.

## Spanish Tax Considerations

This section has been prepared in accordance with the following Spanish tax legislation in force
at the date of this offering memorandum and is subject to any change in law that may take
effect after such date. Prospective investors should consider the legislative changes which could
occur in the future. This section does not cover those tax laws in force in the Spanish Basque
provinces and Navarra as well as the particularities in force in the Spanish autonomous region
(comunidades aut´onomas), or the special rules applicable to transactions among related
persons for Spanish tax purposes.

In particular, note that the Spanish government submitted to the Spanish parliament a draft of
the Budget Law for 2019 which included specific tax measures that may modify the taxation
considerations described in this section. The parliamentary process to approve these measures

306


-----

would have to be reinitiated by the new government elected on January 7, 2020 and it is not
clear if (or how) they might ultimately be approved.

This section does not purport to deal with all aspects of Spanish taxation that relate to
investment in the Notes or that may be relevant to particular investors in light of their
personal investment circumstances. Also prospective investors should note that the
appointment by an investor in Notes, or any person through which an investor holds Notes, of
a custodian, collection agent or similar person in relation to such Notes in any jurisdiction may
have tax implications. If you are considering buying Notes, you should consult your own tax
advisor concerning the tax consequences of holding the Notes in your particular situation.

Whatever the nature and residence of the holder of a beneficial interest in the Notes (each, a
‘‘Beneficial Owner’’), the acquisition and transfer of the Notes will be exempt from indirect
taxes in Spain, for example, exempt from transfer tax and stamp duty, in accordance with the
consolidated text of such tax promulgated by Royal Legislative Decree 1/1993, of 24 September,
and exempt from value added tax, in accordance with Law 37/1992, of 28 December regulating
such tax.

**_Individuals and Legal Entities with tax residency in Spain_**
_Personal Income Tax (Impuesto sobre la renta de las Personas F´ısicas)_
_Interest on the notes and disposal of the notes_
The Notes are deemed securities (activos financieros), in accordance with the definition set
forth in Article 91 of the Personal Income Tax Regulations and its interpretation by the Spanish
tax authorities, and hence the rules provided with regard to securities must be taken into
consideration.

Both interest periodically received and income derived from the transfer, redemption or
repayment of the Notes constitute a return on investment obtained from the transfer of a
person’s own capital to third parties in accordance with the provisions of Section 25.2 of the
Personal Income Tax (‘‘Impuesto sobre la Renta de las Personas F´ısicas’’) Law, and therefore will
form part of the so- called savings income tax base pursuant to the provisions of the Personal
Income Tax Law and will be taxed, together with the other savings income obtained by such
investor in that same tax year, at 19% rate on the first e6,000, at 21% on the portion of the
savings income between e6,001 and e50,000, and at 23% rate on any amount exceeding
e50,000 threshold.

_Spanish withholding tax on the Notes_
A withholding tax at a 19% rate is applicable on interest payments made to individual Spanish
holders in specific circumstances. For instance, in the event the Notes are deposited before or
managed by Spanish-resident entities or persons or by non-resident entities or persons
operating in the Spanish territory through a permanent establishment or if the abovementioned persons or entities have been entrusted with the collection of the income derived
from the Notes, provided that such income has not been previously subject to withholding tax
in Spain. In addition, income obtained upon transfer or redemption of the Notes may also be
subject to Personal Income Tax withholdings. In any event, individual Spanish holders may
credit the withholding against their final Personal Income Tax liability for the relevant fiscal
year.

_Wealth Tax (Impuesto sobre el Patrimonio)_
According to Wealth Tax regulations (subject to any exceptions provided under relevant
legislation in an autonomous region (Comunidad Aut ´onoma)), the net worth of any individuals
with tax residency in Spain up to the amount of e700,000 is not subject to Wealth Tax.
Therefore, they should take into account the value of the Notes which they hold as at
December 31 in each year, the applicable rates range between 0.2% and 2.5%, although the
final tax rates may vary depending on any applicable regional tax laws, and some reductions
may apply.

307


-----

In accordance with Article 3 of Royal Decree-Law 18/2019, of 27 December, as from year 2021,
a full exemption on Spanish Wealth Tax would apply (bonificaci´on del 100%), and therefore
from year 2021 and onwards, individuals resident in Spain would be released from formal and
filing obligations in relation to Wealth Tax unless the application of this full exemption is
postponed or revoked.

_Inheritance and Gift Tax (Impuesto sobre Sucesiones y Donaciones)_
Individuals with tax residency in Spain who acquire ownership or other rights over any Notes
by inheritance, gift or legacy will be subject to Inheritance and Gift Tax in accordance with the
applicable Spanish regional or federal rules, being the taxpayer the transferee. The tax rates
range between 7.65% and 81.6%, depending on relevant factors (such as previous net wealth
or family relationship between the transferor and transferee), although the final tax rate may
vary depending on any applicable regional tax laws.

**_Legal Entities with Tax Residency in Spain for Tax Purposes or a Permanent Establishment in_**
**_Spain of Non-spanish Tax Residents_**

_Corporate Income Tax (Impuesto sobre Sociedades)_
_Interest on the notes and disposal of the notes_
Legal entities with tax residency in Spain are subject to Corporate Income Tax (‘‘CIT’’) on a
worldwide basis. Both interest periodically received and income deriving from the transfer,
prepayment or repayment of the Notes constitute a return on investments for tax purposes
obtained from the transfer to third parties of own capital and must be included in the profit
and taxable income of legal entities with tax residency in Spain for CIT purposes in accordance
with the CIT rules. The current general tax rate according to CIT Law is 25%. Certain CIT
taxpayers may be subject to different CIT rates (for instance, banking institutions, which are
taxable at a 30% rate). The fact that a Spanish company pays interest or guarantee payments
under or in respect of a Note will not lead to an entity being considered tax resident in Spain.

If the Notes form part of the assets of a permanent establishment in Spain of a person or legal
entity who is not resident in Spain for tax purposes, the tax rules applicable to income deriving
from such Notes are the same as those for Spanish CIT taxpayers. See ‘‘—Spanish Tax
_Considerations—Legal Entities with Tax Residency in Spain—Corporate Income Tax (Impuesto_
_sobre Sociedades).’’_

_Wealth Tax (Impuesto sobre el Patrimonio)_
Spanish resident legal entities are not subject to Wealth Tax.

_Inheritance and Gift Tax (Impuesto sobre Sucesiones y Donaciones)_
Legal entities with tax residency in Spain which acquire ownership or other rights over the
Notes by inheritance, gift or legacy are not subject to inheritance and gift tax and must include
the market value of the Notes in their taxable income for Spanish CIT purposes for the fiscal
year in which such Notes, or rights over Notes, are acquired.

**_Tax treatment of income payments made under the note guarantees by a spanish guarantor_**
It is arguable that any payment of principal and interest made by the Guarantors under the
Note Guarantee should be characterized as a payment under an indemnity for Spanish tax
purposes and, therefore, be made free and clear of, and without withholding or deduction for,
any taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatsoever nature imposed, levied,
collected, withheld or assessed by the Kingdom of Spain or any political subdivision or
authority thereof or therein having power to tax.

However, although no clear precedent, statement of law or regulation exits in relation thereto,
in the event that the Spanish tax authorities take the view that a Guarantor resident in Spain
for tax purposes has validly, legally and effectively assumed all the obligations of the Issuer of

308


-----

the Notes subject to and in accordance with the Note Guarantee, they may attempt to impose
withholding tax in the Kingdom of Spain on any payments made by the Guarantor, in respect
of interest, unless the recipient is the beneficial owner of the payment and is:

(i) resident for tax purposes in an EU Member State, other than Spain, or is a permanent
establishment of such resident situated in another EU Member State not resident in or
acting through a territory considered as a tax haven pursuant to Spanish law (currently set
out in Royal Decree 1080/1991 of July 5) nor through a permanent establishment in Spain
or in a country outside the EU, or

(ii) resident of a state with which Spain has entered into a Double Taxation Treaty which
makes provision for full exemption from tax imposed in Spain on such payment under the
Double Taxation Treaty and does not act through a permanent establishment in Spain,

provided that in either case of (i) and (ii) above, such recipient submits to the Guarantor a tax
residence certificate, issued by the corresponding tax authorities in its own jurisdiction stating
its residence for tax purposes either within the relevant EU Member State or in the relevant
country for the purposes of the Double Taxation Treaty, such certificate being valid for the
period of one year beginning from its date of issue under Spanish law. If such certificate is not
provided or payment is made to a holder of Notes who is not resident in the countries set out
in (i) or (ii), the Guarantor, or the Paying Agent acting on its behalf, would be required to
withhold tax from the relevant interest payments at the general withholding tax (19% as at
the date of this offering memorandum).

In connection with Spanish tax resident holders and non-Spanish tax resident holders acting
with respect to the Notes through a permanent establishment in Spain, income deriving from
the Guarantee will be subject to withholding tax and taxation according to the applicable
general rules.

In the event that the first additional provision of Law 10/2014 is applicable to the Notes, the
Guarantor, in accordance with such Law and with Royal Decree 1065/2007, would not be
obliged to withhold taxes in Spain on any interest paid under the Guarantee to the beneficial
owners of the income arising from the Notes (whether tax resident in Spain or not), provided
that the Paying Agent complies with the information procedures described in ‘‘—Information
_about the Notes in connection with payments.’’_

Otherwise, even if the first additional provision of Law 10/2014 is applicable to the Notes, the
Guarantor, or the Paying Agent acting on the Guarantor’s behalf, would be required to
withhold tax from the relevant interest payments at the general withholding tax rate (as at the
date of this offering memorandum, 19%).

**_Information about the Notes in connection with payments_**
As at the date of this offering memorandum, the Guarantor is required by Spanish law to file
an annual return with the Spanish tax authorities in which it reports on certain information
relating to the Notes. In accordance with Section 44 of Royal Decree 1065/2007, for the
purpose of preparing the annual return referred to above, certain information with respect to
the Notes must be submitted to the Issuer (and the Guarantor) at the time of each payment.

Such information would be the following:

a) identification of the Notes (as applicable) in respect of which the relevant payment is
made;

b) date on which relevant payment is made;

c) the total amount of the relevant payment; and

309


-----

d) the amount of the relevant payment and to each entity that manages each clearing and
settlement system for securities situated outside Spain.

In particular, the Paying Agent must certify the information above about the Notes by means
of a certificate.

In light of the above, the Issuer (and the Guarantor) and the Paying Agent have arranged
certain procedures to facilitate the collection of information concerning the Notes. The
procedures for providing documentation referred to in this section will be set out in detail in
the Indenture which may be inspected during normal business hours at the specified office of
the Paying Agent.

## Portuguese tax considerations

This section provides a general description of the tax rules applicable to the acquisition,
ownership and subsequent transfer of the Notes under Portuguese tax law in force as of the
date of this offering memorandum, and does not take into account any developments or
amendments thereof after that date whether or not such developments or amendments have
retroactive effect. This section does not intend to deal with all aspects of Portuguese taxation
that relate to investment in the Notes or that may be relevant to particular investors in light of
their personal investment circumstances.

Prospective purchasers of the Notes are advised to consult their own tax advisors as to the tax
consequences of holding the Notes.

**_Tax treatment of individuals with tax residence in Portugal_**

_Interest on the notes and disposal of the notes_
Interest and other investment income obtained by Portuguese resident individuals or by a nonPortuguese resident individual having a permanent establishment in the Portuguese territory to
which income is attributable on the Notes is subject to Personal Income Tax. If the interest
income is paid or made available through a Portuguese resident entity or a Portuguese branch
of a non-resident entity (a ‘‘Portuguese paying agent’’), such payments to Portuguese resident
individuals will be subject to final withholding taxation at a flat rate of 28%. When subject to
final withholding tax the income does not need to be included in the yearly tax return.

Portuguese resident individuals may nonetheless opt for the aggregation of such income with
the remaining taxable income, which is subject to tax at progressive rates up to 48%. An
additional solidarity surtax will be due on the part of the taxable income exceeding e80,000 as
follows: (i) 2.5% on the part of the taxable income exceeding e80,000 up to e250,000 and
(ii) 5% on the remaining part (if any) of the taxable income exceeding e250,000. In this case,
the tax already withheld is considered as payment on account of the final tax due.

If interest is not derived through a Portuguese paying agent, it is not subject to withholding
taxation in Portugal at the time of the payment but the taxpayer is required to include the
interest in the yearly tax return and apply an autonomous flat rate of 28%, unless an option
for aggregation is made (in which case taxation is due under the rules of the previous
paragraph).

Resident beneficiaries are entitled under certain circumstances to claim an appropriate credit
for any foreign withholding tax against their personal income tax liability.

Non-habitual resident individuals in Portugal may be exempt from investment income arising
from the Notes issued by non-resident entities, under certain circumstances.

The disposal of the Notes by a Portuguese resident individual may generate capital gains taxed
at a flat rate of 28% levied on the positive difference between the capital gains and capital
losses realized each year on the transfer of securities and derivatives, unless the individual

310


-----

elects to include such gain in his taxable income, in which case it will be subject to tax at
progressive income tax rates of up to 48%. An additional solidarity surtax will be due on the
part of the taxable income exceeding e80,000 as follows: (i) 2.5% on the part of the taxable
income exceeding e80,000 up to e250,000 and (ii) 5% on the remaining part (if any) of the
taxable income exceeding e250,000.

The computation of the annual balance of gains and losses for income tax purposes does not
include losses arising from transactions entered into with counterparts resident in a country,
territory or region subject to a more favorable tax regime, as defined by the Portuguese tax
legislation.

_Stamp, wealth and estate taxes_
No stamp tax applies to the acquisition through gift or inheritance of Notes by an individual. A
10% stamp tax will apply to the acquisition through gift or inheritance of Notes deposited in
Portugal, however an exemption applies to close family members (i.e. gifts or inheritance
between father and son or between spouses). There is no wealth or estate tax in Portugal.

**_Corporations resident in Portugal for tax purposes or permanent establishments in Portugal of_**
**_non-Portuguese tax residents_**

_Interest on the notes and disposal of the notes_
Interest income and capital gains derived by non-resident individuals with a permanent
establishment in Portugal to which the income is attributable should be subject to tax at a
final rate of 25%.

Interest income and capital gains derived from the disposal of the Notes by legal persons
resident for tax purposes in Portugal or attributable to a permanent establishment in Portugal
of a non-resident entity are included in their taxable base and subject to corporate tax at a
rate of 21%. An additional municipal surtax (derrama municipal) of up to 1.5% of the taxable
profit may apply. A state surtax (derrama estadual) of 3% on the portion of taxable profits
which exceeds e1,500,000, of 5% on the portion of taxable profits which exceeds e7,500,000
and of 9% on the portion of taxable profits which exceeds e35,000,000 is also applicable.

A corporate tax exemption may apply to specific entities (such as pension funds, retirement
and/or education savings funds, share savings funds and venture capital funds constituted
under the laws of Portugal).

Non-exempt resident beneficiaries are entitled to claim an appropriate credit for any foreign
withholding tax against their final corporate income tax liability.

The acquisition of Notes through gift by a Portuguese resident legal person or attributable to a
Portuguese permanent establishment of a non-resident entity is also subject to corporate tax at
a rate of 21%. The surtaxes mentioned above may also apply.

## Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations

The following is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations of the acquisition,
ownership and disposition of Notes by a U.S. Holder (as defined below). Except for the
summary regarding FATCA (as defined under ‘‘—Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act’’), this
summary deals only with U.S. Holders that purchase the Notes in the Offering for cash at a
price equal to the issue price of the Notes (i.e., the first price at which a substantial amount of
the Notes for each applicable series is sold for cash other than to bond houses, brokers or
similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or
wholesalers) and that will hold the Notes as capital assets (generally property for investment).
The summary does not cover all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant
to, or the actual tax effect that any of the matters described herein will have on, the
acquisition, ownership or disposition of Notes by particular investors, and does not address any

311


-----

tax consequences arising under the Medicare tax on certain investment income, U.S. federal
estate and gift tax laws or under the laws of any state, local, non-U.S. or other taxing
jurisdiction. This summary also does not discuss all the tax considerations that may be relevant
to certain types of investors subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws
(such as financial institutions, insurance companies, investors liable for the alternative minimum
tax, individual retirement accounts and other tax-deferred accounts, tax-exempt organizations,
dealers in securities or currencies, traders that elect to mark to market, real estate investment
trusts, regulated investment companies, grantor trusts, investors that will hold the Notes as
part of straddles, hedging transactions or conversion transactions for U.S. federal income tax
purposes or investors whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar).

As used herein, the term ‘‘U.S. Holder’’ means a beneficial owner of Notes that is, for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, (i) an individual citizen or resident of the United States, (ii) a
corporation (or any other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes)
created or organized under the laws of the United States, any State thereof or the District of
Columbia, (iii) an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax without
regard to its source or (iv) a trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary
supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the
authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or the trust has elected to be treated
as a domestic trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

The U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in a partnership (or other entity or
arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) that holds Notes
will depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Prospective
purchasers that are partnerships (or other entities or arrangements treated as partnerships for
U.S. federal income tax purposes) should consult their tax advisers concerning the U.S. federal
income tax consequences to their partners of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of
Notes by the partnership.

The summary is based on the tax laws of the United States, including the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the ‘‘Code’’), its legislative history, existing and proposed U.S.
Treasury Regulations thereunder, published rulings and court decisions, all as of the date
hereof and all subject to change at any time, possibly with retroactive effect.

**THE SUMMARY OF U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES SET OUT BELOW IS FOR**
**GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY. ALL PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX**
**ADVISERS AS TO THE PARTICULAR TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF OWNING THE NOTES,**
**INCLUDING THE APPLICABILITY AND EFFECT OF STATE, LOCAL, FOREIGN AND OTHER TAX LAWS**
**AND POSSIBLE CHANGES IN TAX LAW.**

## Characterization of the Notes

No authority directly addresses the characterization of securities like the Notes for U.S. federal
income tax purposes and no ruling will be received from the Internal Revenue Service (the
‘‘IRS’’) as to the characterization of the Notes for such purposes. To the extent relevant for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, the Issuer intends to treat the Notes as indebtedness for such
purposes consistent with their form. It is possible, however, that the Notes could be treated as
equity interests in the Issuer. No assurance can be given that the IRS will not assert, or a court
would not sustain, a position regarding the characterization of the Notes that is contrary to
this discussion. If the Notes were treated as equity interests in the Issuer, U.S. Holders may be
treated as owning interests in a passive foreign investment company (or ‘‘PFIC ‘‘), which could
have materially adverse tax consequences for a U.S. Holder. Prospective investors should seek
advice from their own tax advisers as to the consequences to them of alternative
characterizations of the Notes, the possibility that the Notes will be classified as equity interests
in a PFIC and the consequences of owning an equity interest in a PFIC. The discussion below
assumes that the Notes will be treated as debt for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

312


-----

In certain circumstances (see ‘‘Description of Notes—Additional Amounts,’’ ‘‘Description of
Notes—Optional Redemption’’ and ‘‘Description of Notes—Repurchase at the Option of
Holders—Change of Control’’), the Issuer may be obligated to or may elect to make payments
in excess of stated interest or principal of the Notes. These potential payments may implicate
the provisions of the U.S. Treasury Regulations relating to ‘‘contingent payment debt
instruments.’’ However, the Issuer does not intend to treat the possibility of paying such
additional amounts as causing the Notes to be treated as contingent payment debt
instruments. The Issuer’s position is binding on a holder unless such holder discloses its contrary
position in the manner required by applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations. However, the Issuer’s
position is not binding on the IRS, and it is possible that the IRS may take a different position,
in which case, if the IRS’s position is sustained, a holder might be required to accrue ordinary
interest income at a higher rate than the stated interest rate and to treat as ordinary income
rather than capital gain any gain recognized on a taxable disposition of a Note. The discussion
below assumes that the Notes will not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments.
Prospective investors should seek advice from their own tax advisers regarding the possible
application of the contingent payment debt instrument rules to the Notes.

**_Payments of interest_**
‘‘Qualified stated interest’’ paid by the Issuer on the Notes (including any amounts withheld
and any Additional Amounts paid in respect of withholding taxes imposed on payments on the
Notes) will generally be taxable to a U.S. Holder as ordinary income at the time it is received or
accrued, depending on the U.S. Holder’s method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. The term ‘‘qualified stated interest’’ generally means stated interest that is
unconditionally payable in cash or in property, other than debt instruments of the Issuer, at
least annually at a qualifying rate during the entire term of the Note. The Issuer expects that
stated interest on the Notes will be treated as qualified stated interest and taxable as interest
income as described below. The amount of interest income recognized by a cash basis U.S.
Holder will be the U.S. dollar value of the qualified stated interest payment, based on the
‘‘spot rate’’ (as such term is defined in the U.S. Treasury Regulations) on the date of receipt,
regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. Such U.S. Holder will
not recognize foreign currency gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such payment, but
may have foreign currency gain or loss attributable to the actual disposition of the Euros
received.

An accrual basis U.S. Holder may determine the amount of income recognized with respect to a
qualified stated interest payment denominated in Euro in accordance with either of two
methods. Under the first method, the amount of income accrued will be based on the average
exchange rate in effect during the interest accrual period (or, in the case of an accrual period
that spans two taxable years of a U.S. Holder, the part of the period within the taxable year).
The average exchange rate for an accrual period (or partial period) is the simple average rate
for each business day of such period or other average exchange rate for the period reasonably
derived and consistently applied by the U.S. Holder.

Under the second method, the accrual basis U.S. Holder may elect to determine the amount of
income accrued on the basis of the spot rate in effect on the last day of the accrual period (or,
in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years, the spot rate in effect on the last
day of the part of the period within the taxable year). Additionally, if a payment of interest is
actually received within five business days of the last day of the accrual period, an electing
accrual basis U.S. Holder may instead translate the accrued interest into U.S. dollars at the spot
rate in effect on the day of actual receipt. Any such election will apply to all debt instruments
held by the U.S. Holder at the beginning of the first taxable year to which the election applies
or thereafter acquired by the U.S. Holder, and will be irrevocable without the consent of the
IRS.

313


-----

Upon receipt of the interest payment (including a payment attributable to accrued but unpaid
interest upon the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note)
denominated in Euros, the accrual basis U.S. Holder will generally recognize U.S. source
exchange gain or loss (taxable as ordinary income or loss) equal to the difference, if any,
between the amount received (translated into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the date of
receipt) and the amount that was taken into income in the manner described above, regardless
of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars.

Interest income, including any Additional Amounts, will generally constitute foreign source
‘‘passive category’’ income for foreign tax credit purposes. The rules relating to foreign tax
credits and the timing thereof are complex and a U.S. Holder should consult its own tax adviser
regarding the availability of a foreign tax credit and the application of the foreign tax credit
limitations to their particular situation.

**_Disposition of the Notes_**
A U.S. Holder will generally recognize gain or loss on the sale, exchange, retirement or other
taxable disposition of a Note equal to the difference between the amount realized on the
disposition (less an amount equal to any accrued but unpaid qualified stated interest, which
will be taxable as interest income to the extent not previously included in income) and the U.S.
Holder’s tax basis of the Note. A U.S. Holder’s tax basis in a Note will generally be its U.S. dollar
cost. The U.S. dollar cost of a Note purchased with Euro will generally be the U.S. dollar value
of the purchase price calculated at the spot rate of exchange on the date of purchase, or, in
the case of Notes traded on an established securities market (within the meaning of the
applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations), on the settlement date of the purchase if such Notes are
purchased by a cash basis U.S. Holder (or an accrual basis U.S. Holder that so elects). The
amount realized on a sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition for an amount in
Euros will be the U.S. dollar value of this amount calculated at the spot rate of exchange on
the date of the disposition, or, in the case of Notes traded on an established securities market
(within the meaning of the applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations), on the settlement date of the
disposition if such Notes are sold by a cash basis U.S. Holder (or an accrual basis U.S. Holder
that so elects). The election available to accrual basis U.S. Holders in regards to the purchase
and sale of Notes traded on an established securities market must be applied consistently to all
debt instruments from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS.

A U.S. Holder will generally recognize foreign currency gain or loss on the disposition of a
Note to the extent the U.S. dollar value of the Euros received for the Note, based on a spot
rate at the time the U.S. Holder disposes of the Note, is greater or less than the U.S. dollar
value of the Euros paid for the Note, based on the spot rate at the time the U.S. Holder
acquired the Note. Any such exchange rate gain or loss (including any exchange gain or loss
with respect to the receipt of accrued but unpaid interest) will be realized only to the extent
of total gain or loss realized on the sale or retirement. Gain or loss realized on a sale,
exchange or retirement of a Note that is attributable to fluctuation in currency exchange rates
will be ordinary income or loss.

Except to the extent attributable to changes in exchange rates, gain or loss recognized by a
U.S. Holder on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note will be
capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the Note was held by the U.S.
Holder for more than one year. Long-term capital gains recognized by an individual U.S. holder
generally are subject to tax at a lower rate than short-term capital gains or ordinary income.
The deductibility of capital losses is subject to certain limitations.

Gain or loss realized by a U.S. Holder on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable
disposition of a Note generally will be U.S. source. Prospective purchasers should consult their
tax advisers as to the foreign tax credit implications of the sale, exchange, retirement or other
taxable disposition of Notes.

314


-----

**_Reportable transaction reporting_**
Under certain U.S. Treasury Regulations, U.S. Holders that participate in ‘‘reportable
transactions’’ (as defined in the U.S. Treasury Regulations) must attach to their U.S. federal
income tax returns a disclosure statement on IRS Form 8886. Under the relevant rules, a U.S.
Holder may be required to treat a foreign currency exchange loss from the Notes as a
reportable transaction if this loss exceeds the relevant threshold in the U.S. Treasury
Regulations. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors as to the possible obligation to
file IRS Form 8886 with respect to the ownership or disposition of the Notes, or any related
transaction, including without limitation, the disposition of any non-U.S. currency received as
interest or as proceeds from the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of the
Notes.

**_Backup withholding and information reporting_**
Information reporting generally will apply to payments of principal and interest on, and the
proceeds of sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of Notes payable to a U.S.
Holder by a U.S. paying agent or middleman. Backup withholding will apply to these payments
if the U.S. Holder fails to provide an accurate taxpayer identification number, as well as certain
other information, or otherwise establish an exemption from backup withholding. Backup
withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding
rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against a U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax
liability provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS. U.S. Holders should
consult their own tax advisors regarding any additional tax reporting or filing requirements
they may have as a result of the acquisition, ownership or disposition of the Notes.

Certain U.S. Holders who are individuals and who hold an interest in ‘‘specified foreign
financial assets’’ (as defined in section 6038D of the Code) are required to report information
relating to an interest in the Notes, subject to certain exceptions (including an exception for
Notes held in accounts maintained by certain financial institutions) on IRS Form 8938. Under
certain circumstances, an entity may be treated as an individual for purposes of the foregoing
rules. Failure to comply with applicable reporting obligations could result in the imposition of
substantial penalties.

**_Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act_**
Pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (provisions commonly known as ‘‘FATCA’’),
a ‘‘foreign financial institution’’ may be required to withhold U.S. tax on certain ‘‘passthru’’
payments to the extent such payments are treated as attributable to certain U.S. source
payments. Under proposed U.S. Treasury Regulations, withholding on foreign passthru
payments will not be required before the date that is two years after the date on which
applicable final U.S. Treasury Regulations defining foreign passthru payments are published.
Obligations issued on or prior to the date that is six months after the date on which applicable
final U.S. Treasury Regulations defining foreign passthru payments are filed generally would be
‘‘grandfathered,’’ and thus not subject to the rules regarding foreign passthru payments, unless
significantly modified after such date. Accordingly, if the Issuer is treated as a foreign financial
institution, FATCA withholding would apply to payments on the Notes only if there is a
significant modification of the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes after the expiration
of this grandfathering period. However, if Additional Notes are issued after the expiration of
the grandfathering period, have the same identifying number as the original Notes issued
hereby, and are subject to withholding under FATCA, then withholding agents may treat all the
notes, including the Notes issued hereby, as subject to withholding under FATCA. Certain
non-U.S. governments have entered into agreements with the United States to implement
FATCA in a manner that alters the rules described herein. Holders should consult their own tax
advisors on how these rules may apply to their investment in the Notes. In the event any
withholding under FATCA is imposed with respect to any payments on the Notes, there will be
no additional amounts payable to compensate for the withheld amount.

# Certain ERISA Considerations

The following is a summary of certain considerations associated with the purchase of the Notes
by employee benefit plans that are subject to Title I of the U.S. Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, as amended (‘‘ERISA’’), plans, individual retirement accounts and other
arrangements that are subject to Section 4975 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the ‘‘Code’’) or provisions under any other federal, state, local, non-U.S. or other
laws or regulations that are substantially similar to the prohibited transaction provisions of
Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (collectively, ‘‘Similar Laws’’), and entities
whose underlying assets are considered to include ‘‘plan assets’’ of such employee benefit plans,
plans, accounts and arrangements pursuant to the U.S. Department of Labor ‘‘plan assets’’
regulation, 29 CFR Section 2510.3-101, as amended by Section 3(42) of ERISA, or otherwise
(each, a ‘‘Plan’’).

## General Fiduciary Matters

ERISA and the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of a Plan subject to
Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (an ‘‘ERISA Plan’’) and prohibit certain transactions
involving the assets of an ERISA Plan and its fiduciaries or other interested parties. Under ERISA
and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the
administration of such an ERISA Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of such
an ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation to such an
ERISA Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan.

In considering an investment in the Notes of a portion of the assets of any Plan, a fiduciary
should determine whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and
instruments governing the Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar
Law relating to the fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including, without limitation, the prudence,
diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code
and any other applicable Similar Laws.

## Prohibited Transaction Laws

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit ERISA Plans from engaging in
specified transactions involving plan assets with persons or entities who are ‘‘parties in
interest,’’ within the meaning of Section 3(14) of ERISA, or ‘‘disqualified persons,’’ within the
meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless an exemption is available. A party in interest or
disqualified person who engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to
excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. In addition, the
fiduciary of the ERISA Plan that engaged in such a non- exempt prohibited transaction may be
subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and/or the Code.

The acquisition and/or holding of the Notes by a Plan with respect to which the Issuer is a
party in interest or a disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect
prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the
investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual
prohibited transaction exemption. In this regard, the U.S. Department of Labor has issued
prohibited transaction class exemptions (‘‘PTCEs’’) that may apply to the acquisition and holding
of the Notes. These class exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 respecting
transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1
respecting insurance company pooled separate accounts, PTCE 91-38 respecting bank collective
investment funds, PTCE 95-60 respecting life insurance company general accounts and
PTCE 96-23 respecting transactions determined by in-house asset managers. Additional
exemptions are provided under Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code
respecting transactions between a person that is a party in interest (other than a fiduciary or
an affiliate that has or exercises discretionary authority or control or renders investment advice

316


-----

with respect to assets involved in the transaction) solely by reason of providing services to the
plan, provided that there is adequate consideration for the transaction. There can be no
assurance that any class exemption or any other exemption will be available with respect to
any particular transaction involving the Notes, or that if an exemption is available, it will cover
all aspects of any particular transaction.

## Representation

Accordingly, by acceptance of a Note or any interest therein, each purchaser and holder will be
deemed to have represented and warranted that either (i) it is not acquiring or holding the
Note or any interest therein with the assets of a Plan, or (ii) the acquisition, holding and
disposition of the Note or any interest therein will not constitute or result in a non-exempt
prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a violation of
any applicable Similar Laws.

None of the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the
Transfer Agent or the Registrar nor any of its or their respective agents is undertaking to
provide impartial investment advice, or to give advice in a fiduciary capacity, in connection
with the acquisition of any of the Notes by any Plan. Each Plan fiduciary who is responsible for
making the investment decisions whether to purchase or commit to purchase and to hold the
Notes should determine whether, under the general fiduciary standards of investment prudence
and diversification and under the documents and instruments governing the Plan, an
investment in such Notes is appropriate for the Plan, taking into account the overall investment
policy of the Plan and the composition of the Plan’s investment portfolio. Any Plan proposing
to invest in the Notes should consult with its counsel to confirm that such investment will not
constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction and will satisfy the other
requirements of ERISA and the Code. Fiduciaries of Plans subject to any Similar Laws should
confirm that an investment in the Notes will not constitute or result in a violation of such
Similar Laws.

The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all-inclusive, nor should
it be construed as legal advice. Due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties that may
be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly
important that fiduciaries, or other persons considering purchasing the Notes on behalf of, or
with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their counsel regarding the potential applicability of
ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws to such investment and whether an
exemption would be applicable to the purchase and holding of the Notes. Purchasers of the
Notes have the exclusive responsibility for ensuring that their acquisition and holding of the
Notes complies with the fiduciary responsibility rules of ERISA and does not violate the
prohibited transaction rules of ERISA, the Code or applicable Similar Laws. The sale of the
Notes to a Plan is in no respect a representation by us or any of our affiliates or
representatives that such an investment meets all relevant legal requirements with respect to
investments by any such Plan or that such investment is appropriate for any such Plan.

# Plan of Distribution

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in a purchase agreement to be dated the date of
the final offering memorandum (the ‘‘Purchase Agreement’’), the Issuer has agreed to sell to
each Initial Purchaser, and each Initial Purchaser has agreed, severally and not jointly, to
purchase from the Issuer, the Notes. The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of
the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of the Notes are subject to, among other
customary closing conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by counsel.

The Issuer has agreed to pay the Initial Purchasers certain customary fees for their services in
connection with the Offering and to reimburse them for certain out-of-pocket expenses.

The Fixed Rate Notes and the Floating Rate Notes will initially be offered at the respective
price indicated on the cover page of this offering memorandum. After the initial offering, the
offering price and other selling terms of the Fixed Rate Notes and/or Floating Rate Notes may
from time to time be varied by the Initial Purchasers without notice. The Initial Purchasers may
use affiliates or other appropriately licensed entities for sales of the Fixed Rate Notes and the
Floating Rate Notes in jurisdictions in which it is otherwise not permitted.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the Issuer and each Guarantor will indemnify the Initial
Purchasers against certain liabilities, including certain liabilities under the U.S. Securities Act,
and will contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect
thereof.

During a period of 90 days from the date of this offering memorandum, no company of the
Group will offer for sale, sell, contract to sell, grant an option for the sale of, or otherwise
dispose of, directly or indirectly (except through the Initial Purchasers or with the prior written
consent of the Initial Purchasers), any other debt securities or preferred equity securities issued
or guaranteed by any company of the Group (other than the Notes) or securities of any
company of the Group that are convertible into, or exchangeable with, the Notes or such other
debt securities or preferred equity securities.

The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act. The Initial
Purchasers have agreed that they will only offer or sell the Notes (a) in the U.S. to persons
reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the U.S.
Securities Act, and (b) outside the U.S. in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S
under the U.S. Securities Act. Terms used above have the meanings given to them by Rule 144A
and Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act.

Until 40 days after the date on which the Notes are originally issued, an offer or sale of the
Notes within the U.S. by a dealer that is not participating in the Offering may violate the
registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act if that offer or sale is made otherwise than
in accordance with Rule 144A.

Each Initial Purchaser has represented that it (i) has only communicated or caused to be
communicated and will only communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or
inducement to engage in investment activity, within the meaning of section 21 of FSMA,
received by it in connection with the issuance or sale of the Fixed Rate Notes or the Floating
Rate Notes, as applicable, in circumstances in which section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply
to the Issuer or any Guarantor and (ii) has complied and will comply with all applicable
provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything done by it in relation to the Fixed Rate Notes
or the Floating Rate Notes, as applicable, in, from or otherwise involving the UK.

The Notes will constitute a new class of securities with no established trading market.
Application will be made for listing particulars to be approved by the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange and for the Notes to be listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange
and admitted to trading on the Euro MTF market. However, there can be no assurance that the

318


-----

Notes will be, or will remain, so listed and admitted to trading on the Euro MTF market, that
the prices at which the Notes will sell in the market after the Issue Date will not be lower than
the initial offering price or that an active trading market for the Notes will develop and
continue after the Offering. The Initial Purchasers have advised the Issuer that they currently
intend to make a market in the Notes. However, the Initial Purchasers are not obligated to do
so, and may discontinue any market-making activities with respect to the Notes at any time
without notice. In addition, market-making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the
U.S. Securities Act and the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ‘‘U.S. Exchange Act’’), and
may be limited. Accordingly, there can be no assurance as to the liquidity of or the trading
market for the Notes. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes—There may not be an
_active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be_
_limited.’’_

In connection with this Offering, the Initial Purchasers are not acting for anyone other than us
and will not be responsible to anyone other than us for providing the protections afforded to
their clients or for providing advice in relation to this Offering.

Buyers of the Notes sold by the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp taxes, taxes
and other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in
addition to the initial offering price set forth on the cover of this offering memorandum.

The Issuer expects that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the Notes on or
about the date specified on the cover page of this offering memorandum, which will be
business days (as such term is used for the purposes of Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act)
following the date of pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as
‘‘T+ ’’). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market
generally are required to settle in two business days unless the parties to any such trade
expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of
this offering memorandum or the next succeeding business days will be required to
specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed
settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such trades should consult their own
advisors.

In connection with the issue of the Notes, J.P. Morgan Securities plc or persons acting on its
behalf may over-allot Notes or effect transactions with a view to supporting the market price
of the Notes at a level higher than that which might otherwise prevail. However, there is no
assurance that J.P. Morgan Securities plc or persons acting on its behalf will undertake
stabilization action. Any stabilization action may begin on or after the date on which adequate
public disclosure of the terms of the offer of Notes is made and, if begun, may be ended at
any time, but it must end no later than the earlier of 30 days after the Issue Date and 60 days
after the date of the allotment of the Notes.

The Initial Purchasers and/or their affiliates may also receive allocations of the Notes.

The Initial Purchasers and/or their affiliates may also enter into hedging arrangements with us
in connection with the Revolving Credit Facility. The Initial Purchasers and/or their affiliates will
serve as arrangers, bookrunners and lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and
have received, or may in the future receive, customary fees and commissions for these roles
and transactions.

The proceeds of the issuance of the Notes will be partially used to fund the Redemption. See
‘‘Use of Proceeds.’’ The Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates hold or may hold
certain of the Existing Notes to be redeemed with the proceeds of the Notes and as a result
may receive proceeds from the issuance of the Notes, in their capacities as holders of the
Existing Notes. In addition, certain of the Initial Purchasers and/or their affiliates served as
arrangers, bookrunners and lenders under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility that is being
replaced on or about the Issue Date with the Revolving Credit Facility. The Initial Purchasers

319


-----

and/or their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various
activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial
advisory, investment management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage
activities. The Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates from time to time have
provided in the past and may provide in the future investment banking, financial advisory
and/or commercial banking services to us and/or our affiliates (or former affiliates) in the
ordinary course of business, for which they have received or may receive customary fees,
commissions and reimbursement of expenses. The Initial Purchasers and/or their affiliates may
also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views
in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients
that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments. In the ordinary
course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and/or their affiliates may make or hold
a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative
securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the
accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and
instruments of the Issuer or its affiliates. If the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates
have a lending relationship with the Issuer, they may routinely hedge their credit exposure to
the Issuer consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, the Initial
Purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which
consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in the
Issuer’s securities, including potentially the Notes offered hereby. Any such short positions could
adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes offered hereby or may have the effect of
preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the Notes or the Additional Notes, if
any. The Initial Purchasers and/or their affiliates may also make investment recommendations
and publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial
instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and short positions
in such securities and instruments.

# Notice to Investors

_You are advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any offer, resale, pledge or other_
_transfer of any of the Notes offered hereby._

The Notes and the Note Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the U.S.
Securities Act, or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, and, unless so registered, may not
be offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to,
the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and the securities laws of any other
applicable jurisdiction. Accordingly, the Notes offered hereby are being offered and sold only
to qualified institutional buyers (as defined in Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act) in
reliance on Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act and in offshore transactions in reliance on
Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act.

We use the terms ‘‘offshore transaction’’ and ‘‘United States’’ with the meanings given to them
in Regulation S.

Each purchaser of the Notes, by its acceptance thereof, will be deemed to have acknowledged,
represented to and agreed with the Issuer, each Guarantor and the Initial Purchasers as follows:

1. The purchaser understands and acknowledges that the Notes and the Note Guarantees
have not been registered under the U.S. Securities Act or the securities laws of any other
applicable jurisdiction and that the Notes are being offered for resale in transactions not
requiring registration under the U.S. Securities Act or any other securities laws, including
sales pursuant to Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act, and, unless so registered, may
not be offered, sold or otherwise transferred except in compliance with the registration
requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and any other applicable securities laws, pursuant
to an exemption therefrom or in any transaction not subject thereto and in each case in
compliance with the conditions for transfer set forth in paragraphs (4) and (5) below.

Securities Act and is aware that any sale of these Notes to you will be made in reliance
on Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act, and such acquisition will be for your own
account or for the account of another qualified institutional buyer; or

(b) is purchasing the Notes in an offshore transaction in accordance with Regulation S
under the U.S. Securities Act.

3. The purchaser acknowledges that none of the Issuer, the Guarantors or the Initial
Purchasers, nor any person representing any of them, has made any representation to it
with respect to us or the offer or sale of any of the Notes, other than the information
contained elsewhere in this offering memorandum, which offering memorandum has been
delivered to it and upon which it is relying in making its investment decision with respect
to the Notes. It acknowledges that neither the Initial Purchasers nor any person
representing the Initial Purchasers makes any representation or warranty as to the accuracy
or completeness of this offering memorandum. It has had access to such financial and
other information concerning us and the Notes as it has deemed necessary in connection
with its decision to purchase any of the Notes, including an opportunity to ask questions
of, and request information from, the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers.

4. The purchaser is purchasing the Notes for its own account, or for one or more investor
accounts for which it is acting as a fiduciary or agent, in each case for investment, and not
with a view to, or for offer or sale in connection with, any distribution thereof in violation
of the U.S. Securities Act or any state or other securities laws, subject to any requirement

321

of law that the disposition of its property or the property of such investor account or
accounts be at all times within its or their control and subject to its or their ability to resell
such Notes pursuant to Rule 144A, Regulation S or any other exemption from registration
available under the U.S. Securities Act, or in any transaction not subject to the U.S.
Securities Act.

5. If it is purchasing Notes pursuant to Rule 144A, it agrees on its own behalf and on behalf
of any investor account for which it is purchasing the Notes, and each subsequent holder
of the Notes by its acceptance thereof will be deemed to agree, to offer, sell or otherwise
transfer such Notes prior to the date (the ‘‘Resale Restriction Termination Date’’) that is one
year after the later of the date of the original issue and the last date on which we or any
of our affiliates were the owner of such Notes (or any predecessor thereto) only (i) to us,
(ii) pursuant to a registration statement that has been declared effective under the U.S.
Securities Act, (iii) for so long as the Notes are eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144A

under the U.S. Securities Act, (iv) pursuant to offers and sales that occur outside the United
States in compliance with Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act, or (v) pursuant to any

an opinion of counsel, certification and/or other information satisfactory to each of them
and (II) in each of the foregoing cases, to require that a certificate of transfer in the form
appearing on the reverse of the security is completed and delivered by the transferor to
the Trustee. The foregoing restrictions on resale will not apply subsequent to the Resale
Restriction Termination Date.

6. Each purchaser and holder of a Note (or any interest therein) represents and warrants that
either (i) it is not acquiring or holding the Note (or any interest therein) with the assets of
a Plan, or (ii) the acquisition, holding and disposition of the Note (or any interest therein)
will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of
ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a violation of any applicable Similar Laws.

others will rely upon the truth and accuracy of its acknowledgements, representations,
warranties and agreements and agrees that if any of the acknowledgements,
representations, warranties and agreements deemed to have been made by its purchase of
the Notes are no longer accurate, it shall promptly notify the Initial Purchasers. If it is
acquiring any Notes as a fiduciary or agent for one or more investor accounts, it represents
that it has sole investment discretion with respect to each such investor account and that it
has full power to make the foregoing acknowledgements, representations and agreements
on behalf of each such investor account.

12. The purchaser understands that no action has been taken in any jurisdiction (including the
United States) by the Issuer, the Guarantors or the Initial Purchasers that would result in a
public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of this offering
memorandum or any other material relating to us or the Notes in any jurisdiction where
action for such purpose is required. Consequently, any transfer of the Notes will be subject
to the selling restrictions set forth under ‘‘Plan of Distribution’’ and ‘‘Important
_Information.’’_

# Enforcement of Civil Liabilities

The Issuer is incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg and none of its managers are
residents of the United States. Furthermore, a substantial portion of the Issuer’s assets and a
substantial portion of the assets of such persons are located outside the United States. As a
result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process within the United States
upon the Issuer or such persons, or to enforce against them judgments of U.S. courts
predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or state securities laws.

If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. court against the Issuer or a Guarantor, purchasers will need
to enforce such judgment in jurisdictions where the relevant company has assets. Even though
the enforceability of U.S. court judgments outside the United States is described below for the
countries in which the Issuer and the Guarantors are located, you should consult with your own
advisors in any pertinent jurisdictions as needed to enforce a judgment in those countries or
elsewhere outside the United States.

## Luxembourg

We have been advised by our Luxembourg counsel that the United States and Luxembourg are
not currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of
judgments, other than arbitral awards rendered in civil and commercial matters. According to
such counsel, an enforceable judgment for the payment of monies rendered by any U.S. federal
or state court based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon the U.S. securities
laws, would not be directly enforceable in Luxembourg. However, a party who received such
favorable judgment from a U.S. state or federal court, may initiate enforcement proceedings in
Luxembourg (exequatur) by requesting enforcement of the U.S. judgment by the District Court
(Tribunal d’Arrondissement). The District Court will authorize the enforcement in Luxembourg
of the U.S. judgment if it is satisfied that all of the conditions set out in the relevant provisions
of the Luxembourg Nouveau Code de Proc´edure Civile and Luxembourg case law are met.
Those conditions being:

- the U.S. court awarding the judgment has jurisdiction to adjudicate the respective matter
under its applicable U.S. federal or state jurisdictions rules, and the jurisdiction of such U.S.
court is recognized by Luxembourg private international and local law;

- the U.S. judgment is enforceable (ex´ecutoire) in the United States;

- the U.S. court has applied the substantive law as designated by the Luxembourg conflict of
laws rules or, at least, the court order must not contravene the principles underlying those
rules (based on case law and legal doctrine, it is not certain that this condition would still be
required for an exequatur to be granted by a Luxembourg court);

- the U.S. court must have applied the proper law to the matter submitted to it and has acted
in accordance with its own procedural laws;

- the U.S. judgment must not have been obtained subsequent to an evasion of Luxembourg
law (fraude `a la loi luxembourgeoise) and must have been granted following proceedings
where the counterparty had the opportunity to appear, and if appeared, to present a
defense; and

- the U.S. judgment does not contravene international public policy or order as understood
under the laws of Luxembourg and has not been given in proceedings of a criminal, penal or
tax nature (which would include awards of damages made under civil liabilities provisions of
the U.S. federal securities laws, or other laws, to the extent that the same would be classified
by Luxembourg courts as being of a penal or punitive nature (for example, fines or punitive
damages)).

327


-----

Subject to the above conditions, Luxembourg courts tend not to review the merits of a foreign
judgment, although there is no clear statutory prohibition of such review.

We have also been advised by our Luxembourg counsel that if an original action is brought in
Luxembourg, Luxembourg courts may refuse to apply the designated law (i) if the choice of
such law was not made bona fide, or (ii) if the foreign law was not pleaded and proved or
(iii) if pleaded and proved, such foreign law would be contrary to mandatory Luxembourg laws
or manifestly incompatible with Luxembourg public policy or public order rules. In an action
brought in Luxembourg on the basis of U.S. federal or state securities laws, Luxembourg courts
may not have the requisite power to grant the remedies sought. Also, an exequatur may be
refused in respect of punitive damages.

Further, in the event of any proceedings being brought in a Luxembourg court in respect of a
monetary obligation expressed to be payable in a currency other than euro, a Luxembourg
court would have power to give judgment expressed as an order to pay a currency other than
euro.

However, enforcement of the judgment against any party in Luxembourg would be available
only in euro and for such purposes all claims or debts would be converted into euro.

## Spain

Empark and certain other of the Subsidiary Guarantors are organized under the laws of Spain
with limited liability. The controlling shareholders of Empark, and the directors and the
executive officers of Empark and the other Spanish Guarantors are non-residents of the United
States and a significant portion of the assets of such persons are located outside the United
States. As a result, the enforcement in Spain of a judgment issued in another jurisdiction (other
than a EU Member State), must be made in accordance with the Spanish Law 29/2015 of
July 31, on International Legal Cooperation on Civil Matters (hereinafter, the ‘‘ILCC Law’’) in
connection with article 523 of the Spanish Civil Procedural Law (1/2000, 7 de enero, de
_Enjuiciamento Civil) (‘‘LEC 2000’’). An investor may also experience difficulty in effecting service_
of process on or enforcing judgments against such persons or Empark or the other Spanish
Guarantors based on civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal and state securities laws or
other laws.

We have been advised by our Spanish counsel that, at the moment, the United States and
Spain are not currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement
of judgments.

A party in whose favor such judgment was rendered could initiate a procedure to declare its
recognition and authorize its enforcement in Spain (known as exequ´atur) before the relevant
Court of First Instance (Tribunal de Primera Instancia) or the Commercial Court (Juzgado de lo
_Mercantil), as the case may be, pursuant to article 52 of the ILCC Law. According to article 46_
of the ILCC Law, recognition in Spain of such U.S. judgment could be obtained provided that
none of the following circumstances apply:

- the judgment is contrary to Spanish public policy (‘‘´orden p´ublico’’);

- the judgment has been rendered in a clear breach of the rights of defense of any of the
parties and, in particular, if the judgment has been rendered in default of the defendant
(‘‘en rebeld´ıa’’), it would be deemed to breach his rights of defense if the defendant was not
regularly and timely notified to enable it to defend itself properly;

- the subject matter in respect of which the judgment has been rendered falls within the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Spanish courts or, in any other matters, if the foreign court
jurisdiction does not have a reasonable connection with the dispute;

- the foreign judgment is incompatible with other Spanish judgments;

328


-----

- the foreign judgment is incompatible with another country’s prior judgment which meets the
requirements to be enforceable in Spain; or

- there is an ongoing proceeding between the same parties and dealing with the same subject
which was initiated before a Spanish court prior to the opening of the proceedings before
the foreign court.

According to article 50 of the ILCC Law, once the exequ´atur has been obtained, the foreign
judgment will be enforceable in Spain in accordance with LEC 2000. Article 54.1 of the ILCC
Law stipulates that the request for enforcement can be filed along with the brief seeking the
_exequ´atur, although the former would not be granted until the entire exequ´atur procedure_
successfully ends.

According to article 3.2 of ILCC Law, the Spanish Government may deny cooperation with
another state’s authorities if there has been a reiterated refusal to cooperate or a legal
prohibition of providing cooperation by such other state’s authorities provided that the Spanish
Government passes a Royal Decree for these purposes.

Any judgment obtained against either the Issuer or any of the Spanish Guarantors in any
country bound by the provisions of EU Regulation 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and
of the Council would be recognized and enforced in Spain in accordance with the terms set
forth thereby (‘‘EU Regulation 1215/2012’’).

Pursuant to articles 45 and 46 of EU Regulation 1215/2012, the Spanish Courts may not
recognize or enforce a judgment given by the courts of an EU Member State if:

a) it would be manifestly contrary to Spanish public policy;

b) the judgment was given in default of appearance and the defendant was not served with
process in sufficient time and in such a way to enable it to arrange for its defense unless
the defendant failed to commence proceedings to challenge the judgment when it was
possible for it to do so;

c) the judgment is irreconcilable with a judgment given in a dispute between the same
parties in Spain; or

d) the judgment is irreconcilable with an earlier judgment given in another Member State or
in a third State involving the same cause of action and between the same parties, provided
that the earlier judgment fulfils the conditions necessary for its recognition in Spain; or

The Spanish courts may not enforce a judgment given by the courts of an EU Member State if
the party against which enforcement is sought is subject to insolvency proceedings in Spain as
established in article 7 of the Regulation 2015/848 in connection with article 55.1 of the
Spanish Insolvency Law.

Under article 42 of EU Regulation 1215/2012, for the purposes of enforcement in Spain of a
judgment given in another Member State, the applicant shall provide the competent court
with: (a) a copy of the judgment which satisfies the conditions necessary to establish its
authenticity; and (b) a certificate validating that the judgment is enforceable and containing
an extract of the judgment as well as, where appropriate, relevant information on the
recoverable costs of the proceedings and the calculation of interest. The corresponding court
may require the applicant to provide a translation of the contents of the certificate and of the
judgment. According to article 539 of LEC 2000, the applicant shall be directed by an attorney
at law and represented by a court agent. In addition, rules governing Spanish civil
proceedings—as established by article 1 of LEC 2000—cannot be amended by agreement of the
parties and will therefore prevail notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Notes.

Under Spanish procedural law, the general rule is to serve the process personally on each
defendant. The Spanish Supreme Court, taking into account the circumstances of the case,

329


-----

could find that service of process on an agent appointed by a Spanish Guarantor has infringed
Spanish public policy or the rights of defense of the Spanish Guarantors. Should this be the
case, the judgment rendered in the United States would not be recognized in Spain.

Pursuant to article 54 of LEC 2000, the parties to an agreement are entitled to clearly submit
any dispute to the courts of a specific judicial district (provided that under the Spanish
Procedural Law and the Spanish Judicial Law (Ley 6/1985, de 1 de Julio, Org´anica del Poder
_Judicial) the relevant courts are competent to solve the corresponding dispute); therefore, such_
article does not cover the validity of non-exclusive jurisdiction clauses, at least for conflicts
between different Spanish courts.

In the event that an action were brought before Spanish courts, a Spanish court may decide
that it is competent to hear the case even if the other party does not appear before it or
appears and contests its jurisdiction based on the fact that the Notes, Guarantees, Intercreditor
Agreement or other document is submitted to the jurisdiction of the courts of England or New
York, provided, in the case of submission to the courts of England, that the Spanish court
grounds for jurisdiction is recognized under EU Regulation 1215/2012.

Additionally, the Spanish court will apply to the Notes, Guarantees, Intercreditor Agreement or
any other foreign law document the law chosen by the parties in the terms and with the limits
provided for in Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of
17 June 2008 on the law applicable to contractual obligations and, namely:

a) a Spanish court may give effect to the overriding mandatory provisions of the law of the
country where the obligations arising out of the Guarantees or Notes have to be or have
been performed, insofar as those overriding mandatory provisions render the performance
of such obligations unlawful. In considering whether to give effect to those provisions,
regard shall be made to their nature and purpose and to the consequences of their
application or non- application;

b) a Spanish court will apply the law of Spain in a situation where there is an overriding
mandatory provision irrespective of the law otherwise applicable to the Notes or
Guarantees;

c) a Spanish court may refuse to apply New York or English law in relation to the obligations
incurred under the Notes or Guarantees or under the Intercreditor Agreement if such
application violates the public policy (orden p´ublico) of Spain;

d) where all other elements relevant to the situation at the time of the choice are located in
one or more European Union Member States, the parties’ choice of New York law shall not
prejudice the application of provisions of European Union law, where appropriate as
implemented in Spain, which cannot be derogated from by agreement;

e) a Spanish court shall have regard to the law of the country in which performance takes
place in relation to the manner of performance and the steps to be taken in the event of
defective performance; and

f) a Spanish Court may require satisfactory evidence of the New York or English law in
accordance with articles 33 of the ILCC Law and 281.2 of LEC 2000 and, exceptionally if the
parties have not been able to evidence foreign law, Spanish courts may apply Spanish law.

The courts of Spain may render judgments in a currency other than Euros. However, for the
purposes of determining the assets that need to be seized for enforcement purposes, a
judgment in a foreign currency needs to be converted into Euros at the official exchange rate
prevailing on the date on which the enforcement of the foreign judgment is agreed by the
courts of Spain in accordance with article 577 of LEC 2000. If the currency in which the relevant
judgment is expressed is not listed in any official market, the Spanish courts shall apply the

330


-----

exchange rate that they deem appropriate pursuant to the documents that are filed with the
courts by the enforcing party.

## Portugal

Certain of the Guarantors, including the Portuguese Guarantors, are organized under the laws
of Portugal with limited liability. The directors and the executive officers of the Portuguese
Guarantors are non-residents of the United States and a significant portion of the assets of
such persons are located outside the United States. As a result, a final and conclusive judgment
by any federal or state court in the United States (whether or not predicted solely upon U.S.
federal or state securities laws) would not be automatically enforceable in Portugal and its
enforcement must be made in accordance with the Portuguese Code of Civil Procedure.

We have been advised by our Portuguese counsel that the United States and Portugal are not
currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of
judgments. In the absence of any such treaty such judgment will be recognized and enforced in
Portugal according to the procedures set out in the Portuguese Code of Civil Procedure for the
recognition of foreign judgments. A final and conclusive judgment by a U.S. federal or state
court would only be enforceable in the courts of Portugal after having been reviewed and
confirmed by a Portuguese court. The Portuguese court with jurisdiction over such confirmation
will be the Court of Appeal (‘‘Tribunal da Rela¸c˜ao’’) of the judicial district where the relevant
person against whom the judgment will be enforced is established. The following requirements
must be generally met—to the extent applicable: (i) there must be no doubts regarding the
authenticity of the document containing the judgment, nor about the meaning of the
judgement; (ii) the judgment must be final, a definitive and not subject to appeal (‘‘res
_judicata’’), according to the laws of the U.S., where the judgment was rendered; (iii) the_
competence of the court must not have been established fraudulently in order to avoid the
application of Portuguese law; (iv) the case must not have been subject was to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Portuguese courts; (v) the exceptions of ‘‘lis pendens’’ and of ‘‘condition of
res judicata,’’ cannot be argued based on a case pending or judged on a Portuguese Court,
except if the foreign court prevented the jurisdiction; (vi) the defendant must have been duly
served process, under the terms of the laws of the U.S., and the principles of the adversarial
nature of the proceedings and the equality of the parties must have been complied with; and
(vii) the judgment rendered must not be incompatible with the international public policy of
the Portuguese jurisdiction. If the defendant is a Portuguese national or a Portuguese entity,
the defendant may also oppose to the recognition of the foreign judgement on the grounds
that the decision would have been more favorable to them is the foreign court had applied
Portuguese Law, provided that Portuguese Law would be applicable pursuant to the
Portuguese rules on the conflict of laws. This is a judicial process that can be subject to
opposition and the final court decision is also subject to appeal.

## 2 Accounting policies

**A.** **Basis of preparation**
The Group prepared its consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2018
in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European
Union (‘‘IFRS-EU’’) and effective at 31 December 2018, applying the consolidation principles,
accounting policies and measurement basis described in Note 2 of those consolidated financial
statements, so that they present fairly the Group’s consolidated equity and financial position at
31 December 2018, and the consolidated results of its operations, the changes in consolidated
equity and the consolidated cash flows for the year then ended.

These interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the nine months ended
30 September 2019 have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 ‘‘Interim Financial
Reporting’’ by the Parent Company´s management and are unaudited.

Even though the Company is not legally required to prepare interim financial information, it
has been prepared to provide updated financial information of the Group to be included in an
Offering Memorandum for the purpose of a refinancing of the existing Senior Secured Notes.

In accordance with IAS 34, the interim financial report is intended to provide an update on the
latest complete set of the Group’s consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, it focuses on
new activities, events and circumstances that took place during the nine months ended
30 September and does not duplicate information previously reported in the 2018 consolidated
financial statements. Consequently, the interim financial statements at 30 September 2019 do
not include all the information that would be required for complete consolidated financial
statements prepared under International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the
European Union. The accompanying interim financial statements should therefore be read in
conjunction with the Group’s consolidated annual accounts for the year ended 31 December
2018 in order for them to be interpreted correctly.

However, since the accounting policies and measurement basis used in preparing the Group’s
consolidated interim financial information for the nine months ended 30 September 2019 may
differ from those used by certain Group companies, the required adjustments and
reclassifications were made on consolidation to unify such policies and bases and to make them
compliant with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union.
In order to uniformly present the various items that make up the consolidated financial
information, the accounting policies and measurement bases used by the Parent Company have
been applied to all the companies included in the scope of consolidation.

The preparation of interim condensed consolidated financial statements requires the use of
certain critical accounting estimates. The application of IFRS-EU also requires that management
exercise judgment in the process of applying the accounting policies. Note 3 discloses the areas
that require a higher level of judgment or entail greater complexity, and the areas where
assumptions and estimates are significant for the interim financial statements.

The figures contained in the consolidated financial statements are expressed in thousands of
euros, unless otherwise indicated.

**B.** **New standards, interpretations and amendments adopted by the Group**
The accounting policies and measurement basis used to prepare the interim condensed
consolidated financial statements are consistent with those followed in the preparation of the
Group’s annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2018, except
for the estimation of corporate income tax, which is estimated in relation to the annual tax
rate that would be applicable to the Group’s annual results, and the adoption of new
standards that have become effective as of 1 January 2019. Rather, the accompanying
explanatory notes describe events or transactions that may be significant to provide an

understanding of the changes in the financial position and consolidated results of the Group
since the last annual reporting date.

The Group applies, for the first time, IFRS 16 Leases. As required by IAS 34, the impact of the
adoption of the leasing standard and the new accounting policies are disclosed in Note 3
below. Several other amendments and interpretations apply for the first time in 2019, but do
not have an impact on the interim condensed consolidated financial statements of the Group.

The Group has not early adopted any other standard, interpretation or amendment that has
been issued but is not yet effective.

**C.** **Foreign currency translation**

_Functional and presentation currency_
Items included in the interim condensed consolidated financial statements are measured using
the currency of the primary economic environment in which the company operates (‘the
functional currency’). The interim condensed consolidated financial statements are presented in
euros, which is company’s functional and presentation currency.

The assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies are converted
using the closing exchange rate method according to the following rates:

**30/09/2019** **30/09/2019** **30/09/2018** **30/09/2018** **31/12/2018**

## 3 Summary of changes in accounting policies and estimates made

**A.** **Adoption of IFRS 16—Leases**
This note explains the impact of the adoption of IFRS 16 Leases on the group’s interim
condensed consolidated financial statements.

The Group has adopted IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective method of adoption with the
date of initial application 1 January 2019. Under this method, the reclassifications and the
adjustments arising from the new lease accounting rules are directly recognized in the opening
balance on 1 January 2019.

**Adjustments recognised on adoption of IFRS 16**
On adoption of IFRS 16, the Group recognized lease liabilities in relation to leases which had
previously been classified as ‘operating leases’ under the principles of IAS 17 Leases. For the
initial recognition, these liabilities were measured at the present value of the remaining lease
payments, discounted using the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate as of 1 January 2019. The
weighted average lessee’s incremental borrowing rate applied to the lease liabilities on
1 January 2019, was of 7%. The maturity of the lease liabilities will be of EUR 0.6 million until
September 2020, EUR 0.4 million until September 2021 and EUR 4.6 million in the subsequent
years.

For leases previously classified as finance leases the entity recognised the carrying amount of
the lease asset and lease liability immediately before transition as the carrying amount of the
right of use asset and the lease liability at the date of initial application. The measurement
principles of IFRS 16 are only applied after that date.

The difference between the amount of the lease liability recognized in the statement of
financial position at the date of initial application and the operating lease commitments under
IAS 17 is due to leases with a duration lower than 12 months and leases with a low value
and/or with clauses related to variable payments.

F-12


-----

As the Group has opted to implement IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective approach,
whereby the right-of-use asset is recognised in an amount equal to the lease liability. There
were no onerous lease contracts that would have required an adjustment to the right-of-use
assets at the date of initial application.

The change in accounting policy affected the following items in the statement of financial
position on 1 January 2019:

**Assets** **01/01/2019** **30/09/2019**

**Thousand EUR**
**Non-current assets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **6,379** **5,533**

**Total liabilities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **6,379** **5,651**

(1) Right-of-use assets have not been shown separately but included in the line item ‘‘Intangible assets’’ in the statement of
financial position.

**Practical expedients applied**
In applying IFRS 16 for the first time, the group has used the following practical expedients
permitted by the standard:

- the use of a single discount rate to a portfolio of leases with reasonably similar
characteristics

- reliance on previous assessments on whether leases are onerous

- the accounting for operating leases with a remaining lease term of less than 12 months as at
1 January 2019 as short-term leases

- the accounting for operating leases associated with low-value assets as low-value leases

- the exclusion of initial direct costs for the measurement of the right-of-use asset at the date
of initial application, and

- the use of hindsight in determining the lease term where the contract contains options to
extend or terminate the lease.

The group has also elected not to reassess whether a contract is or contains a lease at the date
of initial application. Instead, for contracts entered into before the transition date the group
relied on its assessment made applying IAS 17 and IFRIC 4 determining whether an
Arrangement contains a Lease.

The expenses related to leases for which the Group applied the practical expedient described in
paragraph 5 (a) of IFRS 16 (leases with contract term of less than 12 months and low-value)
amounted to 236 thousand Euros for the nine months ended 30 September 2019.

**The group’s leasing activities and how these are accounted for**
The Group has lease contracts for spaces and buildings where some parking areas are placed,
warehouses, cars and offices. Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a
wide range of different terms and conditions.

F-13


-----

From 1 January 2019, leases are recognised as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability
at the date at which the leased asset is available for use by the group. Each lease payment is
allocated between the liability and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to profit or loss
over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining
balance of the liability for each period. The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter of
the asset’s useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis.

Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. Lease
liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments:

- fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable

- variable lease payment that are based on an index or a rate

- amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees

- the exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that
option, and

- payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee
exercising that option.

The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate
cannot be determined, the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate is used, being the rate that the
lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value in a
similar economic environment with similar terms and conditions.

Right-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following:

- the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability

- any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives
received

- any initial direct costs, and

- restoration costs.

Payments associated with short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognised on a
straight-line basis as an expense in profit or loss. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term
of 12 months or less. Low-value assets comprise IT-equipment and small items of office
furniture.

**B.** **Accounting estimates**
During the nine months of 2019, there have not been any significant changes in the significant
accounting estimates, as described in the Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for
the year ended 31 December 2018.

Although the estimation criteria are based on rational judgements made according to the
objective elements of analysis, future events may require these estimates to be modified
(upwards or downwards) in future reporting periods. In accordance with IAS 8, any changes in
accounting estimates would be made prospectively, recognizing the effects thereof in
consolidated income statement for the period or periods affected.

## 4 Segment and revenue information

**a)** **Segment information**
The Group’s activity mainly consists on the rendering of underground (off-street) and on-street
car parking services, as well as other activities needed to provide integrated vehicle
management services.

The operating segments are presented in a consistent manner with the internal information
presented to the highest authority in decision making. The highest decision-making authority is
responsible for allocating resources to the operating segments and assessing the performance
of such segments. The Board of Managers has been identified as the highest authority in
decision-making.

The operating segments for which information is presented are as follows:

- Off-street parking. The Group designs, builds and operates all manner of off-street parking:
car parks in city centres, in the vicinity of hospitals, airports, bus or train stations,
park-and-ride operations and car parks in national parks. Most Group car parks are operated
by the Group under a concession system.

- On-street: includes other services such as the provision and maintenance of technologies for
regulation compliance, taxation management and handling of traffic fines or provision of
vehicle tow-away services.

- Management: Group specialises in the provision of other services linked to the end-to-end
management of car parking and urban and inter-urban mobility, such as: management of
control of access to nature reserves, provision of temporary parking services at trade fairs
and mass attendance events, combined park and bus services around airports.

- Resident and others: This business involves the construction of car parks whose spaces are
sold directly to the end customer during the time frame of the concession.

disposed on 5 September 2018 (other than the contract at Edinburgh Airport, which was retained) to National Car Parks
Limited.

The Group present disaggregated revenue based on the reportable segments and the
geographical region.

Revenue generated by off-street car parks
Revenue from off-street car parks corresponds to income generated through the use of parking
spaces owned by the Group or held under an administrative concession. Off-street car park
revenue is generated when the hourly parking rate is paid and, in the case of season ticketholders, on an accrual basis.

Revenue generated by the sale of residents’ parking spaces
This business involves the construction of car parks whose spaces are sold directly to the end
customer during the time frame of the concession. The sales and costs are not recorded until
the parking space is delivered, which coincides with the signature of the contract.

Revenue generated by on-street car parks (ORA)
Revenue from the on-street parking meter service is mainly based on the sum corresponding to
the cost of providing the service plus a percentage, generally between 1% and 3%, of the
surplus between that cost and the funds collected. In some on-street contracts the revenue is
fixed (service cost) regardless of the funds collected, which is paid by the City Council. It is
recognised in the accounts at the time the service is provided.

to nature reserves, provision of temporary parking services at trade fairs and mass attendance
events, combined park and bus services around airports.

## 7 Goodwill

As explained in Note 7 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended
31 December 2018, the Group conducts an annual procedure to identify any possible goodwill
impairment. Any possible impairment is calculated by comparing the recoverable amount of
the CGU with the carrying amount.

The Directors and management have considered and assessed reasonably possible changes for
key assumptions and have not identified any other instances that could cause the carrying
amount of the CGU to exceed its recoverable amount.

As there were no indicators for impairment, management has not updated the impairment
calculations as of 30 September 2019.

The breakdown of ‘‘Trade Receivables’’ caption as of 30 September 2019 and 31 December 2018
mainly corresponds to trade receivables from contracts with city councils and public Authorities.
The part corresponding to private clients corresponds to the selling of tickets, leasing,
advertising and maintenance. These commercial operations are undertaken at market prices.

The Group holds the trade receivables with the objective of collecting the contractual cash
flows and therefore measures them subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest
method.

Due to the short-term nature of the current receivables, their carrying amount is considered to
be the same as their fair value.

## 25 Environmental commitments

Environmental activity is defined as any action intended to prevent, reduce or repair damage
to the environment.

The investments derived from environmental activities are valued at acquisition cost and are
activated as increased fixed asset expenses in the financial year in which they are incurred,
following the criteria described in note 2 regarding applicable accounting standards.

Costs derived from the protection and improvement of the environment are attributed to the
results for the financial year in which they are incurred, irrespective of the point when the
monetary or financial flow derived from the same occurs.

compensation or pending obligations of an undetermined amount of an environmental nature
not covered by contracted insurance policies are endowed when the liability or the obligation
establishing the compensation becomes effective.

**Financial information**
The Group’s recurring EBITDA (made up of recurring revenue and costs, without taking into
account the revenue and costs of residents and others) in the nine months ended 30 September
2019 was 67,257 thousand Euros.

As for the Company’s financial risk management policy, this is based on the Group managing
its capital in order to guarantee that it will be in a position to continue operating as a
profitable business, while maximising shareholder return by striking an optimum balance
between debt and equity.

The following are the main risks to which the Group is exposed:

- Liquidity risk: The Group establishes its treasury needs as part of its general policy through
the use of two tools: Treasury budget with a 12-month horizon with monthly detail and
updates and treasury budgets with a 30-day horizon with daily updates and details. These
tools identify treasury needs in volume and time and make plans for new financing needs.

- Credit risk: The Group maintains its cash and cash equivalents in financial institutions with
high credit ratings. It should furthermore be mentioned that there is no significant
concentration of credit risk with third parties.

- Interest rate risk: The interest rate risk of the Group arises basically from long-term
borrowings. The Group has contracted financial instruments that partially cover the risk of
possible interest rate hikes.

- Exchange rate risk: The Group has no significant exchange rate risk since the vast majority of
its assets and liabilities, income and expenses are denominated in euros.

The Group’s workforce is comprised of more than 2,147 workers, 35% of whom are women
and 65% men. The average age is 46 years.

**Research and development**
The Group has implemented research and development activities related to the technology
implemented in different contracts.

**Treasury stock**
There have been no acquisitions of treasury stock.

**Derivatives**
The Group has contracted financial instruments that partially cover the long-term risk of
possible interest rate hikes of outside resources (see Note 15).

**Environmental aspects**
Environmental activity is defined as any action intended to prevent, reduce or repair damage
to the environment.

The investments derived from environmental activities are valued at acquisition cost and are
activated as increased fixed asset expenses in the financial year in which they are incurred,
following the criteria described in note 2 regarding applicable accounting standards.

Costs derived from the protection and improvement of the environment are attributed to the
results for the financial year in which they are incurred, irrespective of the point when the
monetary or financial flow derived from the same occurs.

The provisions relative to probable or certain responsibilities, legal proceedings in process and
compensation or pending obligations of an undetermined amount of an environmental nature
not covered by contracted insurance policies are endowed when the liability or the obligation
establishing the compensation becomes effective.

At 30 September 2019, the costs or expenses incurred with regard to environmental aspects are
insignificant.

As for any such potential contingencies as may arise in the field of the environment, the
directors do not believe that they would have any significant impact on the enclosed financial
statements.

# Audit report

To the Partner of
**Arena Luxembourg Investments S.`a r.l.**

## Report on the audit of the consolidated financial statements

 Our opinion

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view
of the consolidated financial position of Arena Luxembourg Investments S.`a r.l. (the
‘‘Company’’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘‘Group’’) as at 31 December 2018, and of its consolidated
financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.

_What we have audited_
The Group’s consolidated financial statements comprise:

- the consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2018;

- the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year then ended;

- the consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year then ended;

- the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended; and

- the notes to the consolidated financial statements, which include a summary of significant
accounting policies.

## Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with the Law of 23 July 2016 on the audit profession
(Law of 23 July 2016) and with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) as adopted for
Luxembourg by the ‘‘Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier’’ (CSSF). Our
responsibilities under the Law of 23 July 2016 and ISAs as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF
are further described in the ‘‘Responsibilities of the ‘‘R´eviseur d’entreprises agr´e´e’’ for the audit
of the consolidated financial statements’’ section of our report.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
basis for our opinion.

We are independent of the Group in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board
for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code) as adopted for
Luxembourg by the CSSF together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit
of the consolidated financial statements. We have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities
under those ethical requirements.

## Other information

The Board of Managers is responsible for the other information. The other information
comprises the information stated in the consolidated management report but does not include
the consolidated financial statements and our audit report thereon.

Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and
we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to
read the other information identified above and, in doing so, consider whether the other
information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our
knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on
the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other
information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

## Responsibilities of the Board of Managers for the consolidated financial statements

The Board of Managers is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the
consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union,
and for such internal control as the Board of Managers determines is necessary to enable the
preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement,
whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Board of Managers is responsible for
assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters
related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of
Managers either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic
alternative but to do so.

## Responsibilities of the ‘‘R´eviseur d’entreprises agr´e´e’’ for the audit of the consolidated financial statements

The objectives of our audit are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated
financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or
error, and to issue an audit report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high
level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Law
of 23 July 2016 and with ISAs as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF will always detect a
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to
influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial
statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with the Law of 23 July 2016 and with ISAs as adopted for
Luxembourg by the CSSF, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional
scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial
statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive
to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis
for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is
higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;

F-44


-----

- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;

- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of
accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Board of Managers;

- conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Managers’ use of the going concern basis
of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty
exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to
continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are
required to draw attention in our audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated
financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our
conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our audit report.
However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going
concern;

- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial
statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements
represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation;

- obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the
entities and business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated
financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of
the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the
planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant
deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

## Report on other legal and regulatory requirements

The consolidated management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements
and has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

Arena Luxembourg Investments S.`a r.l. (the ‘‘Company’’) was incorporated on 22 June 2017 and

On 28 July 2017, the Company agreed to acquire 100% of Empark Aparcamientos y

## 2 Accounting policies

**A.** **Basis of preparation**
The Managers of the Company have prepared the Group’s consolidated financial statements at
31 December 2018 in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards issued
and effective or issued and early adopted as at the time of preparing these statements (April
2019), as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and as adopted by the
European Union (IFRS-EU).

The policies indicated below have been applied consistently to all of the fiscal years presented
in these consolidated financial statements, unless otherwise indicated.

These consolidated financial statements present fairly the Group’s equity and financial position
at 31 December 2018 and its consolidated results, changes in consolidated equity and
consolidated cash flows for the year then ended.

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, as
amended in those cases established by IFRS-EU where certain assets and liabilities are carried at

fair value. The Parent company has elected the following options in those cases in which
IFRS-EU permits alternative criteria:

- Measurement of property, plant and equipment, investment property and intangible assets at
historical cost, capitalising financial costs during the construction period.

The preparation of consolidated financial statements under IFRS-EU requires the use of certain
critical accounting estimates. It also requires Management to exercise judgement in the process
of applying accounting policies. Note 5 discloses the areas that require a higher level of
judgment or entail greater complexity, and the areas where the assumptions and estimates are
significant for the consolidated financial statements.

The figures contained in the consolidated financial statements are expressed in thousands of
euros, unless otherwise indicated.

**Standards and interpretations**
**a)** **Mandatory standards, amendments and interpretations applicable as from 1 January 2018:**

As a result of their approval, publication and entry into effect on 1 January 2018, the following
standards have been applied:

- IFRS 9 ‘‘Financial instruments’’

IFRS 9 Financial instruments replaces IAS 39 starting this year. The principal changes affect the
classification and measurement of financial assets and liabilities, the financial asset impairment
model and hedge accounting.

IFRS 9 has been applied starting 1 January 2018 without restating comparative information for
2017. The application of this standard did not have a significant impact on the consolidated
financial statements.

The measurement category of financial assets and liabilities in accordance with IAS 39 and
IFRS 9 at January 1, 2018 are compared as follows:

**Classification at 31.12.2017** **Classification as from 01.01.2018**
**Type of instrument** **(IAS 39)** **(IFRS 9)**

Trade and other receivables Loans and receivables Amortized cost

Financial assets classified as Assets held for sale Fair value through other
held for sale comprehensive income

Derivatives financial Financial assets held for Fair value through profit or
instruments(*) trading loss

Financial assets at fair value Financial assets held for Fair value through profit or
through profit or loss trading loss

Borrowings and trade and Other financial liabilities Amortized cost
other payables

(*) For derivatives not designated as accounting hedges

- IFRS 15 ‘‘Revenue from contracts with customers’’ and IFRS 15 (Amendment) ‘‘Clarifications
**to IFRS 15 ‘‘Revenue from contracts with customers’’:**

In accordance with IFRS 15, revenues should be recognised when control of a good or service is
transferred to the customer at the amount of the consideration to which the Group expects to
be entitled in exchange for such goods or services. A five-step process must be applied before
revenue can be recognised:

- Step 1: Identify the contract or contracts with the customer.

- Step 2: Identify the obligations in the contract.

- Step 3: Determine the transaction price.

F-53


-----

- Step 4: Distribute the transaction price between the contract’s performance obligations.

- Step 5: Recognise revenues when (or as) the entity performs each of its obligations.

The Group has applied the effects on 1 January 2018 after having updated its internal policies

**b)** **Standards, amendments and interpretations approved by the European Union and**
**effective in the years starting on or after 1 January 2019.**

At the date of the drawn up of these consolidated financial statements, the IASB and IFRS
Interpretations Committee had published the standards, amendments and interpretations
indicated below, although the Group has not adopted them early.

- IFRS 16 ‘‘Leases’’

IFRS 16 is effective for all years starting on or after 1 January 2019. Early adoption is permitted
and it may be applied retroactively in full or through a modified retroactive transition.

IFRS 16 establishes a single accounting model to be applied in the lessee’s balance sheet. The
lessee recognises the right of use of an asset representing its right to use the asset and a
liability representing its obligation to make payments under the lease. The Standard includes
two exemptions to the recognition of the right to use in the lessee’s accounting, leases for low
value assets and short-term leases (leases for less than 12 months).

The Group has evaluated the potential impacts that the new standard will have on its
consolidated financial statements and concluded it will not be significant.

In addition, the Group is analysing the impacts that the regulations indicated below might
have on the consolidated financial statements, although they are not expected to be
significant.

- IFRIC 23 ‘‘Uncertainty over income tax treatments’’.

- IAS 19 (amendment) ‘‘Plan amendment, curtailment or settlement’’.

- IAS 28 (amendment), ‘Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures’.

- IFRS 9 (amendment): ‘‘Prepayment features with negative compensation’’

**c)** **Standards, amendments and interpretations applied to existing standards that cannot be**
**adopted early or have not been adopted by the European Union at the date of this note:**

At the date these consolidated financial statements were prepared, the IASB and the IFRS
Interpretations Committee had published the standards, amendments and interpretations
indicated below, which have yet to be adopted by the European Union or whose effective date
is subsequent to the date of these consolidated financial statements:

- IFRS 10 (Amendment) and IAS 28 (Amendment) ‘‘Sale or contribution of assets between an
investor and its associate or joint venture’’.

- IFRS 17 ‘‘Insurance contracts’’.

- IAS 1 (Amendment) and IAS 8 (Amendment) ‘‘Definition of material’’.

- IFRS 3 (Amendment) ‘‘Definition of a business’’.

The Group is analysing the impacts that new regulations may have on its consolidated financial
statements.

**B.** **Group accounting**
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its
subsidiaries on which it has control as for the year ended 31 December 2018. Control is
achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement
with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the
investee.

Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and
ceases when the Group loses control.

Profit or loss and each component of OCI are attributed to the equity holders of the parent of
the Group and to the non-controlling interests, even if this results in the non-controlling
interests having a deficit balance. When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial
statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with the Group’s
accounting policies. All intra-group assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash
flows relating to transactions between members of the Group are eliminated in full on
consolidation.

A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a loss of control, is accounted for
as an equity transaction.

If the Group losses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the related assets (including
goodwill), liabilities, non-controlling interest and other components of equity, while any
resultant gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. Any investment retained is recognised at
fair value.

The consolidation has been carried out on the basis of the following criteria:

- Companies in which Arena Luxembourg Investments S.`a.r.l has effective control, were fully
consolidated.

- UTJVs are integrated into the consolidated financial statements using the proportional
consolidation method.

- Companies in which the holding of Arena Luxembourg Investments S.`a r.l. has significant
influence, are accounted using the equity method.

The assets and liabilities of the foreign companies have been converted into Euros on the basis
of the year-end exchange rate for the assets and liabilities and the year’s average exchange
rate for the income and expenditure accounts. The equity of consolidated companies that use

F-55


-----

an operating currency other than the Euro have been converted using historical exchange
rates.

Non-controlling interests in the results and equity of subsidiaries are shown separately in the
consolidated statement of comprehensive income, changes in equity and financial position.

a) Subsidiaries

Subsidiaries are those companies, including special purpose entities, over which the Group,
directly or indirectly, exerts or could exert control.

In assessing whether the Group controls another companies, consideration is given to the
existence and impact of potential voting rights which can currently be exercised or converted.

Business Combinations

Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of acquisition
is the sum of the transferred consideration, which is valued at fair value as of the date of
acquisition, and the sum of the acquired company’s non-controlling interests, where applicable.
For each business combination, the Group chooses if it values the non-controlling interests of
the acquired company at fair value or the proportional portion of the acquired company’s
identifiable net assets.

Acquisition-related costs are expensed.

The business combinations in which the Group acquires control of one or several businesses
through the merger or division of various companies or through the acquisition of all asset
elements of a company or a part which constitutes one or several businesses, are recorded
through the acquisition method, which implies the accounting, on the acquisition date, of the
identifiable acquired assets and liabilities assumed at fair value, so long as it can be measured
reliably.

Any contingent consideration which must be transferred by the acquiring company is
recognised at fair value on the date of acquisition.

Goodwill is valued initially at cost (being the surplus of the sum of the transferred
consideration, the recorded non-controlling interest and any holding held previously over the
net value of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities). If the fair value of the acquired net
assets exceeds the value of the transferred consideration, the Group performs a new
assessment to ensure that all acquired assets and assumed liabilities have been identified
correctly, and reviews the applied procedures to value the amounts recognised on the date of
acquisition. If this new assessment results in a surplus, the difference is recognised directly in
the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as a bargain purchase.

After initial recognition, goodwill is recorded at cost minus any loss due to accumulated
impairment. For the purposes of the impairment test, goodwill acquired through a business
combination is assigned, from the date of acquisition, to each Group cash generating unit
which benefits from the combination, regardless of whether there are other acquired company
assets or liabilities assigned to these units.

The business combinations for which, at the financial year end date, the necessary valuation
process to apply the acquisition method has not been concluded, are entered using provisional
values. These values must be adjusted within a maximum period of one year from the
acquisition date. Adjustments which are recognised to supplement the initial accounting are
completed retroactively, so that the resulting values are those which would be derived after
having this information initially, adjusting the comparative figures as a result.

b) Investments in associates

An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence. Significant influence is
the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee, but is
not control or joint control over those policies.

The considerations made in determining significant influence is similar to those necessary to
determine control over subsidiaries. The Group’s investments in its associates is accounted for
using the equity method.

Under the equity method, the investment in an associate is initially recognised at cost. The
carrying amount of the investment is adjusted to recognise changes in the Group’s share of net
assets of the associate since the acquisition date. Goodwill relating to the associate is included
in the carrying amount of the investment and is not tested for impairment separately.

The statement of profit or loss reflects the Group’s share of the results of operations of the
associate. Any change in OCI of those investees is presented as part of the Group’s OCI. In
addition, when there has been a change recognised directly in the equity of the associate, the
Group recognises its share of any changes, when applicable, in the statement of changes in
equity. Unrealised gains and losses resulting from transactions between the Group and the
associate are eliminated to the extent of the interest in the associate.

The aggregate of the Group’s share of profit or loss of an associate is shown on the face of the
statement of profit or loss outside operating profit and represents profit or loss after tax and
non-controlling interests in the subsidiaries of the associate.

The financial statements of the associates are prepared for the same reporting period as the
Group. When necessary, adjustments are made to bring the accounting policies in line with
those of the Group.

After application of the equity method, the Group determines whether it is necessary to
recognise an impairment loss on its investments in its associates. At each reporting date, the
Group determines whether there is objective evidence that an investment in an associate is
impaired. If there is such evidence, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the
difference between the recoverable amount of the investment and its carrying value, and then
recognises the loss within ‘Share of profit of an associate’ in the statement of profit or loss.

Upon loss of significant influence over an associate, the Group measures and recognises any
retained investment at its fair value. Any difference between the carrying amount of the
associate upon loss of significant influence and the fair value of the retained investment and
proceeds from disposal is recognised in profit or loss.

c) UTJVs

The consolidated statement of financial position and the consolidated statements of profit or loss
of these companies have been consolidated proportionally in the consolidated statement of
financial position and in the consolidated statement of profit or loss as of 31 December 2018.

The Group recognises its direct right to the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of these
joint arrangements and its share of any jointly held on incurred assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses. These have been incorporated in the consolidated financial statements under the
appropriate headings.

Non-realised outcomes deriving from reciprocal transactions are eliminated in proportion to the
holding, in addition to the amounts of reciprocal assets, liabilities, income, expenses and cash flows.

During 2018, the proportional integration method has been used to consolidate UTJV DornierHostele ´on, UTJV Dornier-Maksu Vitoria, UTJV Torrellobeta, UTJV Valls, UTJV Palma, UTJV
Devas 1 and UTJV Devas 2.

**C. Foreign currency translation**

_Functional and presentation currency_
The Group’s consolidated financial statements are presented in Euros (EUR), which is the
Company’s functional currency and of most of its subsidiaries. For each entity, the Group
determines the functional currency and items included in the financial statements of each
entity are measured using that functional currency. The Group uses the direct method of
consolidation and on disposal of a foreign operation, the gain or loss that is reclassified to
profit or loss reflects the amount that arises from using this method.

The assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies are converted
using the closure exchange rate method according to the following rates:

**31/12/2018** **31/12/2018** **31/12/2017** **31/12/2017**

**Exchange rate** **average** **close** **average** **close**

Euro / UK Pound . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 0.8847 0.8945 0.8767 0.8872
Euro / Turkish lira . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5.707 6.0588 4.1206 3.5464

_Transactions and balances in currencies other than the functional currency_
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded by the Group’s entities at their
respective functional currency spot rates at the date the transaction first qualifies for
recognition.

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the
functional currency spot rates of exchange at the reporting date.

Differences arising on settlement or translation of monetary items are recognised in profit or
loss with the exception of monetary items that are designated as part of the hedge of the
Group’s net investment in a foreign operation. These are recognised in OCI until the net
investment is disposed of, at which time, the cumulative amount is reclassified to profit or loss.
Tax charges and credits attributable to exchange differences on those monetary items are also
recorded in OCI.

Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are
translated using the exchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items
measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the
date when the fair value is determined. The gain or loss arising on translation of non-monetary
items measured at fair value is treated in line with the recognition of the gain or loss on the
change in fair value of the item (i.e., translation differences on items whose fair value gain or
loss is recognised in OCI or profit or loss are also recognised in OCI or profit or loss,
respectively).

_Translation of financial information in currencies other than the functional currency_
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into Euros at
the rate of exchange prevailing at the reporting date and their statements of profit or loss are
translated at exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. The exchange
differences arising on translation for consolidation are recognised in OCI. On disposal of a
foreign operation, the component of OCI relating to that particular foreign operation is
reclassified to profit or loss.

Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation and any fair value adjustments
to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities arising on the acquisition are treated as assets

F-63


-----

and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the spot rate of exchange at the
reporting date.

**D. Intangible assets**
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of
intangible assets acquired in a business combination is their fair value at the date of
acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any
accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Internally generated intangibles,
excluding capitalised development costs, are not capitalised and the related expenditure is
reflected in profit or loss in the period in which the expenditure is incurred.

The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as either finite or indefinite.

Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over the useful economic life and assessed for
impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The
amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite useful
life are reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period. Changes in the expected useful
life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset
are considered to modify the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and are treated
as changes in accounting estimates. The amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite
lives is recognised in the statement of profit or loss in the expense category that is consistent
with the function of the intangible assets.

Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortised, but are tested for impairment
annually, either individually or at the cash-generating unit level. The assessment of indefinite
life is reviewed annually to determine whether the indefinite life continues to be supportable.
If not, the change in useful life from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis.

Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference
between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in
the statement of profit or loss when the asset is derecognised.

a) Concessions
‘‘Concessions’’ in the consolidated statement of financial position includes mainly concession
arrangements for the construction and operation of car park spaces concessions arrangements,
within the scope of IFRIC 12. This standard defines the treatment of public-to-private service
concession arrangements when:

- the grantor controls or regulates what services the operator must provide with the
infrastructure, to whom it must provide them, and at what price; and

- the grantor controls any significant residual interest in the infrastructure at the end of the
term of the arrangement.

In these concession arrangements, the operator acts as a service provider; specifically, on the
one hand, providing infrastructure construction and upgrade services and, on the other,
providing operation and maintenance services over the term of the arrangement. The
consideration received for these services is recognised according to the type of contractual
right received:

- When the right to charge a price to the users of the public service is received and this right is
not unconditional but is rather contingent on the extent to which the users actually use the
service, the consideration for the construction or upgrade service is recognised using the
intangible asset model, in which the demand risk is borne by the concession operator.

- When an unconditional right to receive cash or another financial asset from (or on behalf of)
the grantor is received, and the grantor has little or no discretion to avoid payment, the
consideration for the construction or upgrade service is recognised as a financial asset under,

F-64


-----

using the financial asset model, in which the concession operator does not bear any demand
risk (it is paid even if the infrastructure is not used, given that the grantor guarantees the
concession operator that it will pay a fixed or determinable amount or cover any shortfall).

- When there is a combination of the two aforementioned arrangements, the bifurcated
model is applied to each component of the arrangement.

The model applicable to most of the main concessions operated by the Group is the intangible
asset model, since the consideration received generally consists of the right to charge users a
fee for the use of the public service, and the fee depends on users’ effective use thereof.

The useful life is defined as being in line with concessions periods.

_Intangible asset model_
Concessions are generally recognized as assets measured at the total amount of the payments
made to obtain them, which includes the costs directly allocable to construction incurred until
they are ready for use (studies and designs, compulsory purchases, reinstatement of services,
project execution, project management and administration expenses, installation work and
building construction and similar costs) and the related portion of other indirectly allocable
costs, to the extent that they relate to the construction phase.

Cost also includes the borrowing costs incurred before the assets are ready for their intended
use arising from the borrowings arranged to finance the related projects.

For concessions classified as intangible assets, provisions for dismantling, removal and
restoration and any work to upgrade the infrastructure or increase its capacity the revenue
from which is provided for in the initial contract are capitalised at the start of the concession
and the amortisation of these assets and the interest cost relating to the provisions are
recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss. Also, provisions for the costs to be
incurred in replacing and repairing the infrastructure are systematically recognised in profit or
loss as the corresponding obligation is incurred.

Upkeep and maintenance expenses that do not lead to a lengthening of the useful life of the
assets or an increase in their production capacity are expensed as incurred.

Concessions have a finite useful life and their cost, if recognised as an intangible asset, is
recognised in profit or loss through its amortisation over the concession term, using the
straight-line method for such purpose.

Lastly, at least at each reporting date, it is periodically determined whether there is any
indication that an asset or group of assets might have become impaired so that an impairment
loss can be recognised or reversed in order to adjust the carrying amount of the assets to their
recoverable amount.

**b) Computer applications**
Licences acquired for computer programs from third parties are capitalised on the basis of the
costs incurred in acquiring them and preparing the specific program for use.

The Group depreciates its computer applications on a straight-line basis, distributing the cost of
the assets between the estimated useful lives of the same, which is three years.

**E. Property, plant and equipment**
Construction in progress is stated at cost, net of accumulated impairment losses, if any. Plant
and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment
losses, if any. Such cost includes the cost of replacing part of the plant and equipment and
borrowing costs for long-term construction projects if the recognition criteria are met. When
significant parts of plant and equipment are required to be replaced at intervals, the Group
depreciates them separately based on their specific useful lives. Likewise, when a major

F-65


-----

inspection is performed, its cost is recognised in the carrying amount of the plant and
equipment as a replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied. All other repair and
maintenance costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred. The present value of the
expected cost for the decommissioning of an asset after its use is included in the cost of the
respective asset if the recognition criteria for a provision are met.

Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets,
as follows:

**Estimated**
**useful life**

Buildings and other constructions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 50

An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant part initially recognised is
derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or
disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference
between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the
statement of profit or loss when the asset is derecognised.

The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of property, plant and equipment
are reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.

**F. Impairment of non-financial assets**
The Group assesses, at each reporting date, whether there is an indication that an asset may be
impaired. If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required,
the Group estimates the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the
higher of an asset’s or Cash Generating Unit’s (‘‘CGU’’) fair value less costs of disposal and its
value in use. The recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset
does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or
groups of assets. When the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable
amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.

In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value
using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of
money and the risks specific to the asset. In determining fair value less costs of disposal, recent
market transactions are taken into account. If no such transactions can be identified, an
appropriate valuation model is used. These calculations are corroborated by valuation
multiples, quoted share prices for publicly traded companies or other available fair value
indicators.

The Group bases its impairment calculation on detailed budgets and forecast calculations,
which are prepared separately for each of the Group’s CGUs to which the individual assets are
allocated. These budgets and forecast calculations generally cover a period of five years. A
long-term growth rate is calculated and applied to project future cash flows after the fifth
year.

Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in the statement of profit or loss in
expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset, except for properties
previously revalued with the revaluation taken to OCI. For such properties, the impairment is
recognised in OCI up to the amount of any previous revaluation.

For assets excluding goodwill, an assessment is made at each reporting date to determine
whether there is an indication that previously recognised impairment losses no longer exist or

F-66


-----

have decreased. If such indication exists, the Group estimates the asset’s or CGU’s recoverable
amount. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in
the assumptions used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment
loss was recognised. The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not
exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been
determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior
years. Such reversal is recognised in the statement of profit or loss unless the asset is carried at
a revalued amount, in which case, the reversal is treated as a revaluation increase.

Goodwill is tested for impairment annually and when circumstances indicate that the carrying
value may be impaired. Impairment is determined for goodwill by assessing the recoverable
amount of each CGU (or group of CGUs) to which the goodwill relates. When the recoverable
amount of the CGU is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised.
Impairment losses relating to goodwill cannot be reversed in future periods.

Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually at the CGU
level, as appropriate, and when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be
impaired.

**G. Interest costs**
General and specific borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or
construction of intangible assets or property, plant and equipment requiring a period of time
longer than one year in order to be fit for use are included in the cost until such time as the
asset is in operational condition.

**H. Financial instruments**
As from 1 January 2018 financial assets have been classified as financial assets at amortised cost
or financial assets at fair value through profit or loss or through other comprehensive income.

Amortized Cost: assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash
flows represent solely payments of principal and interest. Interest income from these financial
assets is included in finance income using the effective interest rate method.

Exchange gains and losses and impairments related to the financial assets are immediately
recognized in the Consolidated Income Statement.

Fair value through other comprehensive income (‘‘FVOCI’’): assets that are held for collection of
contractual cash flows and for selling the financial assets, where the assets’ cash flows
represent solely payments of principal and interest. Interest income from these financial assets
is included in finance income using the effective interest rate method.

Fair value through profit and loss (‘‘FVPL’’): assets that do not meet the criteria for amortized
cost or FVOCI. Changes in fair value of financial instruments at FVPL are immediately
recognized in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

The classification depends on the business model used by the Group to manage financial assets
and the contractual terms of cash flows.

All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of financial assets not
recorded at fair value, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial
asset.

All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and
borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs.

Financial assets and liabilities are recognized and derecognized on their trade date (the date
that the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.).

F-67

Impairment of financial assets
The new impairment model requires an impairment provision to be recognised based on
expected loss rather than incurred loss as under IAS 39. IFRS 9 requires recognising impairment
on all financial instruments not measured at fair value.

The application of the credit risk impairment model based on expected loss has not had a
significant impact at 1 January 2018.

Hedge accounting
The Group has elected to apply the new hedging model under IFRS 9. This new model
attempts to align accounting criteria with risk management. Additionally, it increases flexibility
in hedge accounting and in terms of hedging effectiveness, eliminates the requirement for
retrospective assessment.

The Group has conducted an analysis, identifying differences in processes and has implemented
the necessary changes in processes and controls to ensure the correct documentation of
hedging derivatives in accordance with IFRS 9.

Until December 2017, the Group’s non derivative financial instruments were classified according
to the following categories:

- Financial instruments at fair value through profit and loss.

- Loans and receivables.

- Available for sale assets.

- Held to maturity.

- Other financial liabilities.

The classification depended on the nature and purpose that the Group set to the financial
instrument.

Financial assets and liabilities were recognized and derecognized on their trade date.

Financial assets were initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs, except for those
financial assets classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.

Financial liabilities, including borrowings, were initially measured at fair value, net of
transaction costs and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest
method, with interest expense recognized on an effective yield basis.

**I. Fair value measurement**
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value
measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the
liability takes place either:

- In the principal market for the asset or liability

- In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or
liability

The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Group.

The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market
participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act
in their economic best interest.

The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which
sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable
inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.

F-68


-----

All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements
are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level
input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:

Level 1—Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities

Level 2—Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair
value measurement is directly or indirectly observable

Level 3—Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair
value measurement is unobservable

For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements at fair value on a
recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the
hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to
the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.

For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group has determined classes of assets and
liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the
level of the fair value hierarchy, as explained above.

**J. Inventories**
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.

Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less
estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.

The cost of finished products and products in progress, which corresponds to developments in
progress and those completed, includes costs incurred in the construction of car parks intended
for assignment of usage.

Parking spaces held for sale and included in inventories are valued at the acquisition price or
production cost.

The appropriate value restatements are made when the cost exceeds the market value and are
recognised as an expense in the consolidated statement of profit or loss. If the circumstances
leading to the value correction cease to exist, the reversal is recognised as income in the
consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

**K. Cash and short-term deposits**
Cash and short-term deposits in the statement of financial position comprise cash at banks and
on hand and short-term deposits with a maturity of three months or less, which are subject to
an insignificant risk of changes in value.

For the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist
of cash and short-term deposits, as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts as they
are considered an integral part of the Group’s cash management.

**L. Equity**
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of
new shares are recognised in equity as a deduction, net of taxes.

Treasury stock is recorded in equity as a reduction in equity when acquired, with no result
being recorded in the consolidated statement of profit or loss for its sale or cancellation.
Income and expenditure arising from transactions with treasury stock are recorded directly in
equity as a reduction in reserves.

F-69


-----

**M. Redundancy compensation**
Redundancy compensation is paid to employees as a result of a decision by the Group to
terminate their employment contracts prior to the normal retirement age, or if the employee
agrees to retire voluntarily in exchange for such provisions. The Group recognises these
provisions when a proven commitment has been agreed for the termination of the
employment of workers, in accordance with a detailed, formal plan, with no possible
withdrawal, or an agreement has been reached to provide redundancy compensation as a
result of an offer made in order to encourage voluntary redundancies. Those provisions which
are not payable within twelve months of the date of the balance sheet are discounted at their
current value.

**N. Provisions**

_General_
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a
result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits
will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of
the obligation. When the Group expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for
example, under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset, but
only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense relating to a provision is
presented in the statement of comprehensive income net of any reimbursement.

If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current
pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When discounting
is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.

_Contingent liabilities recognised in a business combination_
A contingent liability recognised in a business combination is initially measured at its fair value.
Subsequently, it is measured at the higher of the amount that would be recognised in
accordance with the requirements for provisions above or the amount initially recognised less
(when appropriate) cumulative amortisation recognised in accordance with the requirements
for revenue recognition.

_Provisions required under IFRIC 12_
These provisions relates to the provisions associated with future work, essentially in concessions
accounted for using the intangible asset, that the Group’s concession operators are required to
carry out as a result of the use of the infrastructure in order to maintain and restore it.

These provisions are recognised on the basis of the best estimate of future disbursements
required to carry out the next cycle of work on the infrastructure, with the provisions being
systematically recognised during each cycle with a charge to the consolidated statement of
profit or loss on the basis of the usage of the infrastructure (with an average duration at each
of the concessions of between seven and ten years) until the work is actually carried out. These
future disbursements are estimated on the basis of technical studies, the quantification of
which is subject, inter alia, to the situation of the infrastructure when the work is performed
and to fluctuations in construction service price indexes. Consequently, the annual cash
outflows associated with these provisions vary according to the duration of each work cycle.

**O. Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting**

_Initial recognition and subsequent measurement_
The Group uses derivative financial instruments, such as forward currency contracts, interest
rate swaps and forward commodity contracts, to hedge its foreign currency risks, interest rate
risks and commodity price risks, respectively. Such derivative financial instruments are initially
recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are
subsequently remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair
value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative.

F-70


-----

Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives are taken directly to
profit or loss, except for the effective portion of cash flow hedges, which is recognised in OCI
and later reclassified to profit or loss when the hedge item affects profit or loss.

For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as:

- Fair value hedges when hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised
asset or liability or an unrecognised firm commitment.

- Cash flow hedges when hedging the exposure to variability in cash flows that is either
attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly
probable forecast transaction or the foreign currency risk in an unrecognised firm
commitment.

- Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation.

At the inception of a hedge relationship, the Group formally designates and documents the
hedge relationship to which it wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management
objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. The documentation includes identification of
the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged
and how the entity will assess the effectiveness of changes in the hedging instrument’s fair
value in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item’s fair value or cash flows
attributable to the hedged risk. Such hedges are expected to be highly effective in achieving
offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows and are assessed on an ongoing basis to
determine that they actually have been highly effective throughout the financial reporting
periods for which they were designated.

Hedges that meet the strict criteria for hedge accounting are accounted for, as described
below:

_Cash flow hedges_
The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in OCI in the
cash flow hedge reserve, while any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the
statement of comprehensive income.

Amounts recognised as OCI are transferred to profit or loss when the hedged transaction
affects profit or loss, such as when the hedged financial income or financial expense is
recognised or when a forecasted transaction occurs. When the hedged item is the cost of a
non-financial asset or non-financial liability, the amounts recognised as OCI are transferred to
the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability.

If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or
rollover (as part of the hedging strategy), or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, or when
the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss
previously recognised in OCI remains separately in equity until the forecast transaction occurs
or the foreign currency firm commitment is met.

**P. Taxes**

_Corporate income tax_
Corporate income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be
recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute
the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date in the
countries where the Group operates and generates taxable income.

Current income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity.
Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations
in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions
where appropriate.

F-71


-----

_Deferred tax_
Deferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences between the tax
bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes at the
reporting date.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except:

- When the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or
liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the
transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss

- In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries,
associates and interests in joint arrangements, when the timing of the reversal of the
temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences
will not reverse in the foreseeable future

Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be
available against which the deductible temporary differences, the carried forward unused tax
credits or the unused tax losses can be utilised.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to
the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow
all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are
re-assessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become
probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in
the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws)
that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

Deferred taxes related to items not recognised in profit or loss are recorded in OCI or directly
in equity.

Tax benefits acquired as part of a business combination, but not satisfying the criteria for
separate recognition at that date, are recognised subsequently if new information about facts
and circumstances change. The adjustment is either treated as a reduction in goodwill (as long
as it does not exceed goodwill) if it was incurred during the measurement period or recognised
in profit or loss.

The Group offsets deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities if and only if it has a legally
enforceable right to set off current tax assets and current tax liabilities and the deferred tax
assets and deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority
on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities which intend either to settle
current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities
simultaneously, in each future period in which significant amounts of deferred tax liabilities or
assets are expected to be settled or recovered.

_Value Added Tax (VAT)_
Expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of VAT, except:

- When the VAT incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the
taxation authority, in which case, the VAT is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of
the asset or as part of the expense item, as applicable.

- When receivables and payables are stated with the amount of VAT included

The net amount of VAT recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as
part of receivables or payables in the consolidated statement of financial position.

**Q. Revenue recognition**
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of
goods and services in the ordinary course of activities. The revenue recognized by the Group is
measured at the transaction price of the consideration received or receivable to which the
Group is entitled to, excluding taxes or duties and after eliminating sales within the Group.

Revenue is recognized at a point in time or over time from sales when control has been
transferred and there is no unfulfilled performance obligation that could affect the acceptance
by the customer.

Where the contracts include multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated
to each performance obligation based on the stand-alone selling prices. Where these are not
directly observable, they are estimated based on the expected cost plus margin.

The Group does not expect to have any contracts where the period between the transfer of
the promised goods or services to the customer and payment by the customer exceeds one
year. As a consequence, the Group does not adjust any of the transaction prices for the time
value of money.

The Group has concluded that it is the principal in all of its revenue arrangements since it is
the primary obligor in all the revenue arrangements, has pricing latitude, and is also exposed
to inventory and credit risks.

**a) Revenue by business line:**
a.1) Off-street and resident spaces
a.2) On-street
a.3) Selling of parking spaces
a.4) Management

**a.1) Off-street**
Off-street car park revenue is recognised when the hourly parking rate is paid and, in the
case of season ticket-holders, on an accrual basis. Mixed car parks (with off-street and
resident spaces) record income as follows: in the case of off-street spaces, in the manner
described in the preceding paragraph; and in case of resident spaces, the amount received
is recorded in the consolidated statement of profit and loss at the time of the transfer of
concession usage of the corresponding parking spaces. The cost of residential spaces is
recognised in inventories and are transcribed to the consolidated statement of profit and
loss on the date of the transfer of the concession of usage.

**a.2) On-street**
Income from the on-street car parks service (ORA) is mainly based on the amounts
regarding to the cost of providing the service plus a percentage, generally between 1%
and 3%, of the surplus between that cost and the cash collected. In some on-street car
parks contracts, income is obtained as a fixed percentage of the take, payable by the Local
Council. It is recognised in the accounts at the time the service is provided.

**a.3) Selling of parking spaces**

This business involves the construction of car parks whose spaces are sold directly to
customers during the time frame of the concession. The sales and costs are not recorded
until the parking space is delivered, which tends to coincide with the signature of the
contract or, exceptionally, with the public deed of sale.

**a.4) Management**

This business line regards to the management of contracts of a third party car park, mainly
located in airports, ports and shopping malls.

F-73


-----

**R. Leases**
The determination of whether an arrangement is (or contains) a lease is based on the
substance of the arrangement at the inception of the lease. The arrangement is, or contains, a
lease if fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset (or assets)
and the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset (or assets), even if that asset is (or those
assets are) not explicitly specified in an arrangement.

_Group as a lessee_
A lease is classified at the inception date as a finance lease or an operating lease. A lease that
transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership to the Group is
classified as a finance lease.

Finance leases are capitalised at the commencement of the lease at the inception date fair
value of the leased property or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease liability
so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance
charges are recognised in finance costs in the statement of profit or loss.

A leased asset is depreciated over the useful life of the asset. However, if there is no
reasonable certainty that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term, the
asset is depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset and the lease
term.

An operating lease is a lease other than a finance lease. Operating lease payments are
recognised as an operating expense in the statement of profit or loss on a straight-line basis
over the lease term.

_Group as a lessor_
Leases in which the Group does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of
ownership of an asset are classified as operating leases. Initial direct costs incurred in
negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased
asset and recognised over the lease term on the same basis as rental income. Contingent rents
are recognised as revenue in the period in which they are earned.

## 3 Significant accounting estimates and judgements

The preparation of the Group’s consolidated financial statements requires management to
make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues,
expenses, assets and liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures, and the disclosure of
contingent liabilities. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in
outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset or liability
affected in future periods. The Group based its assumptions and estimates on parameters
available when the consolidated financial statements were prepared. Existing circumstances and
assumptions about future developments, however, may change due to market changes or
circumstances arising beyond the control of the Group. Such changes are reflected in the
assumptions when they occur.

In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management has made the
following estimates and judgements, which have the most significant effect on the amounts
recognised in the consolidated financial statements:

**_Business combination_**
As explained in Note 4, the Group has acquired Empark Group which resulted in an aggregate
amount of goodwill of 172,867 thousand Euros, being the excess of the aggregate of the
consideration transferred over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. In
the view of the management, embedded intangible assets within the acquired businesses

F-74


-----

(together with a related contract, identifiable assets or liabilities) or arising from contractual or
legal rights have been separated within the consolidated financial statements.

Under non-current and current liabilities of the consolidated statement of financial position,
the Group has recorded provisions totalling 80,410 thousand Euros and 10,932 thousand Euros,
respectively. Making assumptions and estimates regarding the discount rate and the expected
costs to be incurred is an essential part of determining the value of these provisions. These
estimates were made based on the best information available on 31 December 2018 regarding
the events analysed.

For the purposes of accounting for the liabilities as per business combination, any matters
classified by the Group as probable risk have been recorded as long-term provisions, as well as
those which are classified as possible risk, considering the percentage occurrence in each case.

Considerable management judgement is necessary in the identification and valuation of
identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed (including purchase price allocation). Such
judgement is exercised based on careful analysis of the acquired business, their financial and
commercial arrangements and expected economic benefits. The premise of value used in the
valuation of intangibles for a purchase price allocation is fair value. The estimate of fair value
has been determined based on the income approach. The income approach is the most
common technique used to value intangibles, both because it captures expected future returns
to the owners and because it is able to estimate value for unique assets when a market
transaction is not available. Market data may often be obtained to estimate the income stream
that is likely to be generated from particular assets.

**_Assessment of possible impairment losses on certain non-financial assets_**
The valuation of non-current assets other than financial assets requires the use of estimates to
determine their fair value for the purpose of evaluating any potential impairment, especially
for goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life. In order to establish this fair
value, the Company’s Board of Managers estimate the future cash flows expected from the
assets or the cash generating units to which they belong and apply an appropriate discount
rate in order to calculate the current value of those cash flows. Future cash flows depend on
whether budgets for the forthcoming five financial years are met, whereas the discount rates
depend on the interest rate and risk premium associated with each cash generating unit.

As the acquisition date of Empark Group was very close to these consolidated financial
statements, in view of the Board of Managers, the Purchase Price Allocation analysis gives a
fair view of recoverable amounts of non-financial assets as at 31 December 2018.

Note 7 details the hypothesis used to calculate the value-in-use of the cash generating unit in
which goodwill is included.

**_Taxes_**
Uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation of complex tax regulations, changes in tax
laws, and the amount and timing of future taxable income. Given the wide range of
international business relationships and the long-term nature and complexity of existing
contractual agreements, differences arising between the actual results and the assumptions
made, or future changes to such assumptions, could necessitate future adjustments to tax
estimation. The Group establishes provisions and recognises deferred taxes, based on
reasonable estimates, for possible consequences of audits by the tax authorities of the
respective countries in which it operates and estimated timing differences on reported assets
and liabilities (including for acquired businesses).

The amount of such provisions is based on various factors, such as experience of previous tax
audits and differing interpretations of tax regulations by the taxable entities and the
responsible tax authority. Such differences of interpretation may arise on a wide variety of

F-75


-----

issues depending on the conditions prevailing in the respective domicile of the Group
companies.

Deferred tax assets are recorded for all deductible temporary differences, negative tax bases
pending compensation and deductions pending application, where it is likely that the Group
will have future taxable income that allows the application of these assets. The Board of
Managers have to make significant estimates to establish the sum of deferred tax assets which
may be recorded, considering the amounts and dates on which future tax earnings will be
obtained and the reversal period of temporary taxable differences.

The Group has not carried forward losses on which no future taxable income is expected.

## 4 Business combination

**31/12/2018**
The acquisition of Garatge Sala Rostes S.L.U as of June 18, 2018, has generated a greater value
of the asset by amount of 1,067 thousand Euros, without give rise to goodwill.

On 27 December 2018 the Company purchased 100% of the 1,000 shares, each with a nominal
value of 60.11 Euros, in the company Parking El Arenal, S.A. The purchase totalled
3,929 thousand Euros, without give rise to goodwill.

**31/12/2017**
On 19 December 2017, the subsidiary MEIF5 Arena Holdings, S.A.U. acquired 100% of Empark
Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A.U., the parent company of Empark Group. The business
combination was recorded on this date, considering the Purchase Price Allocation (‘‘PPA’’)
analysis prepared by an independent expert following the IFRS 3 guidelines. The result of the
analysis is shown in the independent report dated in 26 March 2018.

The following assumptions have been considered:

- It has been determined that the contracts will generate cash flows with terms up to maturity;
this period is between 5 and 50 years, depending on the concession.

- The associated income and expenditure forecasts were performed in accordance with the
following general criteria:

  - In the case of income, in order to estimate price variations, consideration was given to
the estimated variation in the consumer price index (CPI) for each of the countries where
the investments are operational, the appropriate price review formulae as set forth in
the concession contracts on the basis of the price variation indices and/or any specific
correction factors which may apply.

Ramp up during the first 2-5 years of the concession has been taken into account in the
case of new contracts, depending on the specific analysis of each contract; subsequently,
an evolution in income similar to previous income has been estimated.

  - In terms of expenditure, the evolution thereof was calculated on the basis of the
corresponding expected evolution in the CPI rates, in addition to the forecast evolution
of the business.

  - Consideration was also given to the cost of works to be performed in order to maintain
and improve infrastructure, based on the best estimate available according to the
group’s experience, and taking into consideration the forecast evolution of the business.

  - The forecast cash flows obtained on the basis of the projected income and expenditure,
in accordance with the aforementioned criteria, were updated at the discount rate
resulting from adding to the long-term cost of money the risk premium assigned by the
market to the country where the group performs its operations, the risk premium

F-76


-----

assigned by the market to each business (both based on a long-term vision), along with
the financial structure of the group or cash-generating unit in question. A discount rate
of 7.1% was applied.

  - On the other hand, provisions for fixed fees at a risk-free discount rate have been
updated.

377,739 thousand Euros, property, plant and equipment of 112,065 thousand Euros and
assets using the equity method for 64 thousand Euros. The tax effect of this asset
revaluation is reflected as liabilities through deferred taxes for 116,977 thousand Euros.

C) The outcome of deferred tax assets corresponds to elimination of goodwill pending tax
amortisation for the sum of 1,424 thousand Euros, and an update of provisions for fees for
the sum of 2,098 thousand Euros.

D) Adjustment of Madrid ORA contract linearization for the sum of (14,057) thousand Euros
for clients and (4,224) thousand Euros for suppliers, and remuneration pending payment.
Consequently, the fair value of the trade receivables amounts to 26,565 thousand Euros,
net of provision for doubtful debts.

E) Corresponds to adjustment of provisions due to regularisation of discount rate for
provisions for fees (IFRIC 12) for the sum of 8,393 thousand Euros and on the other hand
recording of other tax provisions in relation to those tax contingencies with a probable
and possible risk of success, at the estimated percentage of occurrence, for the sum of
6,252 thousand Euros

F) Adjustment for non-controlling interests (NCI) for the sum of 12,176 thousand Euros. The
fair value of the NCI has been valued as their proportionate part of identifiable net assets
of the acquiree, which means that goodwill recognized, relates only to the controlling
interest acquired.

From this business combination analysis a goodwill of 172,772 thousand Euros arose (Note 7).
The goodwill arising from acquisition comprises the value of expected synergies from the
acquisition of Empark Group. None of the goodwill recognised is expected to be deducted for
income tax purposes.

The Group conducts an annual procedure to identify any possible deficit in the registered cost
with regard to the recoverable value of goodwill.

Any possible impairment is calculated by comparing the book value of the CGU carrying
goodwill with its recoverable value

In order to determine the recoverable value of the CGU carrying goodwill, the following
process was performed:

- It has been determined that the corresponding CGU will generate cash flows with terms up
to maturity; this period is between 5 and 50 years, depending on the concession.

- The associated income and expenditure forecasts were performed in accordance with the
following general criteria:

  - In the case of income, in order to estimate price variations, consideration was given to
the planned official variation in the consumer price index (CPI 2%), the appropriate price
review formulae as set forth in the concession contracts on the basis of the price
variation indices and/or any specific correction factors which may apply.

Ramp up during the approximate first 5 years of the concession has been taken into
account in the case of new contracts, depending on the specific analysis of each
contract; subsequently, and change in income similar to previous contracts has been
estimated.

  - In terms of expenditure, the change thereof was calculated on the basis of the predicted
change in corresponding CPI rates (2%), as well as on the planned change in activity.

  - Consideration is also given to the impact of works to be performed in order to maintain
and improve infrastructure, based on the best estimate available according to the

F-82


-----

company’s experience, and taking into consideration the forecast evolution of the
business.

  - Consideration was given to the future costs and income associated with renewals of
contracts and also the investments required for these renewals on the basis of the
investments occurring in previous contracts. Renewal rates used have been estimated at
approximately 75% based on actual rates obtained by the Company.

  - The forecast cash flows obtained on the basis of the projected income and expenditure,
in accordance with the aforementioned criteria, were updated at the discount rate
resulting from adding to the long-term cost of money the risk premium assigned by the
market to the country where the company performs its operations, the risk premium
assigned by the market to each business (both based on a long-term vision), along with
the financial structure of the company or cash-generating unit in question. A discount
rate of approximately 7% was applied.

No indications of impairment in the existing goodwill were identified.

Similarly, sensitivity analyses have been performed on reasonably possible changes to the main
valuation variables (CPI, inflation, discount rate, renewals) and the recoverable value remains
above the net book value.

With regards to the assumptions for calculation of value in use, Management considers that no
reasonable or possible change to any of the indicated assumptions would cause the unit’s book
value to exceed its recoverable value.

On 26 July 2017, the Spanish tax group was notified of the Settlement corresponding to the
tax inspection mentioned previously which was signed on a contested basis by the Spanish tax
group and appealed on 2 August 2017 before the Central Economic and Administrative Court.
On 17 September 2018 the case was brought forward and on 11 October 2018 claims were
presented with no response to date.

- With regards to Corporation Tax for the 2010 and 2011 years, the Settlement Agreement
required a payment of 815 thousand euros. In order to avoid possible future penalties and
based on the inspection criteria, the Spanish tax group decided to present additional
declarations for the years from 2012 to 2016 for the sum of 12,640 thousand euros, without
prejudice to the fact that its criteria is correct and its claims will be successful. The total
amount paid by the Spanish tax group for this heading amounts to 13,455 thousand euros.

In 2018, the Spanish tax group presented a settlement for 2017 corporation tax, following
the inspection criterion, which will be claimed before the AEAT in the next few months due
to a dispute on criteria.

- With regards to Value Added Tax for 2011, the Settlement Agreement required a payment of
529 thousand euros. In order to avoid possible future penalties and based on the inspection
criteria, the Spanish tax group decided to present additional declarations for the years from
September 2013 to December 2016 for the sum of 2,130 thousand euros, without prejudice
to the fact that its criteria is correct and its claims will be successful. The total amount paid
by the Spanish tax group for this heading amounts to 2,659 thousand euros. This amount
was charged to Dornier, S.A.U., a company which is part of the tax group.

which will be claimed before the AEAT in the next few months due to a dispute on criteria.

- On 27 February 2018 the Spanish tax group was notified of a Sanctions Proceedings
Agreement by the tax inspection mentioned previously, which was signed on a contested
basis. The total amount of the proceedings is 4,726 thousand euros for the inspection of
Corporation Tax for 2010 and 2011 and 209 thousand euros for the inspection of Value
Added Tax for 2011.

On 17 September 2018 the claim was brought forward, and on 11 October 2018, the claims
were presented with no response to date.

In the opinion of the Company’s Managers, as well as its tax consultants, the proceedings
between the Spanish tax group and the tax authorities due to the tax inspection do not have a
probable risk, and consequently there are no significant tax contingencies which could arise
from this situation.

are subject to inspection for the six last financial years for all applicable taxes, from 2012 to
2017 for Corporate Income Tax and 2013 to 2018 for other taxes.

## 34. Contingent liabilities, contingent assets and commitments

**Contingent liabilities as of 31/12/18**
The Group’s Management estimated that no significant payments will arise from the

approximately 51,380 thousand Euros (48,029 thousand Euros as of 31 December 2017).

The following are the details of the main guarantees granted by the Group:

the municipalities that awarded concessions for operation and the obligations arising from
contract execution and sales promotions and several appeals lodged due to disagreement in
respect of settlement of municipal taxes.

- Dornier, S.A.U. had guarantees with third parties for an amount of 11,768 thousand Euros
(2017: 18,049 thousand Euros), which were mostly presented before municipal governments

with certain payments of municipal taxes.

The main disputes in progress in the Group can be classified into one of these two types:

Property tax (IBI) proceedings:

- Taken by Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A.U. against Madrid City Council for bills sent
between 2007 and 2010, as they notified the land registration in 2010.

- Taken by Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A.U. against user communities for bills paid
which correspond to these communities by contract.

Proceedings against contract awards:

- Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A.U. and Dornier, S.A.U. are taking action against the
awards of contracts. They are also being sued by companies who took part in the bidding for
other contracts won by Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A.U. and Dornier, S.A.U.

The Group do not believe that any of the aforementioned proceedings will result in significant
liabilities for the Group.

## 36. Environmental commitments

Environmental activity is defined as any action intended to prevent, reduce or repair damage
to the environment.

The investments derived from environmental activities are valued at acquisition cost and are
capitalised as increased intangible assets and property, plant and equipment expenses in the
period in which they are incurred, following the criteria described in Note 2 regarding
applicable accounting standards.

Costs derived from the protection and improvement of the environment are attributed to the
results for the period in which they are incurred, irrespective of the point when the monetary
or financial flow derived from the same occurs.

The provisions relative to probable or certain responsibilities, legal proceedings in process and
compensation or pending obligations of an undetermined amount of an environmental nature
not covered by contracted insurance policies are endowed when the liability or the obligation
establishing the compensation becomes effective.

## 38. Financial instruments: risk management objectives and policies

The Group’s activities are exposed to various financial risks: market risk (including exchange
rate risk, interest rate risk and price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.

Risk management is controlled by the Group which identifies, evaluates and covers financial
risks in accordance with the policies approved by the Boards of the Group companies. The
Board provides policies for overall risk management and for specific areas such as exchange
rate risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, use of derivative and non-derivative instruments and
the investment of surplus liquidity.

The financial risks to which the Group is exposed include those derived from the guarantees
and bonds required in order for the group to undertake its activities.

As of 31 December 2018 and 2017, the Group had in place bank guarantees with third parties
and guarantee commitments with other Group companies in order to engage in its business.

_Capital management_
Capital includes equity attributable to the equity holders of the parent Company.

The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to ensure that it maintains a
strong credit rating and healthy capital ratios in order to support its business and maximise
shareholder value.

The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in
economic conditions. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the
dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares.

**Market risk: Exchange rate risk**
Management has established an exchange rate risk management policy for foreign currencies
other than the operating currency. Forward contracts, negotiated by the finance department,
are used to manage exchange rate risk arising from future trade transactions and recognised
assets and liabilities. Exchange rate risk arises where future commercial transactions or
recognised assets or liabilities are quoted in a currency other than the group’s operating
currency.

The Group has no significant exchange rate risk, as most of its assets and liabilities, income and
expenses, are expressed in Euros. Companies operating outside the Eurozone (United Kingdom
and Turkey), use the currency of their country of origin to express their assets, liabilities,
income and expenses.

**Market risk: Interest rate risk from cash flows and fair value**
At 31 December 2018 and 2017, if the interest rates on outside resources quoted in Euros had
been 50 basis points higher/lower, with all other variables remaining constant, the result after
taxes for the period would not have varied significantly as a result of an increase/decrease in
the cost of interest on variable-rate loans.

F-116


-----

The Group carries out the appropriate interest rate hedges by contracting an IRS (Interest Rate
Swap) (Note 18).

Interest rate risk occurs as a result of possible losses caused by variations in the fair value or
future cash flows of a financial instrument as a result of changes in market interest rates. The
Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in interest rates mainly arises from variable interest
rate credits and loans.

Out of the 521,824 thousand Euros of long term debt in 2018 (535,317 of debt minus
13,493 thousand Euros of cost of issuance), only 146,747 thousand Euros are influenced by the
Euribor. Out of the 525,718 thousand Euros of long term debt in 2017 (541,611 of debt minus
15,893 thousand Euros of cost of issuance), only 149,305 thousand Euros are influenced by the
Euribor. Below are details of net non-current funding classified based on interest rate structure:

**2018** **2017**

Variable interest rate funding is Euribor-linked.

**Interest rate sensitivity**
As of December 31, 2018 if the interest rates were increased/decreased 50 basis points, with no
other changes considered, the consolidated results would decrease/increase by 802 thousand
Euros, mainly due to a higher/lower financial expense, regarding to loans at variable rates.

**Credit risk**
Credit risk is handled by the Group. Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative
financial instruments and deposits held in banks and financial institutions, along with
wholesale and retail clients including pending accounts receivable and committed transactions.
With respect to banks and financial institutions, only financial institutions that are known to be
reputable and solvent are accepted.

Credit risk occurs as a result of the possible loss caused by a breach of contractual obligations
by the Group’s counterparts, in other words the possibility of not recovering financial assets at
the value accounted for and within the established deadlines.

Maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 December 2018 and 2017 is as follows:

Breakdowns are periodically prepared showing the age of each balance receivable, which serve
as a basis for managing their collection. Debt with an age in excess of 1 year is reviewed on an
annual basis and a monthly insolvency provision is allocated.

Details of customer credit risk concentration at 31 December 2018 and 2017 are shown below:

**2018** **2017**

**Number of** **Number of**
**customers** **Amount** **customers** **Amount**

The customer credit risk is almost fully concentrated in governmental institutions.

Credit risks from balances with banks and financial institutions are managed by the Group in
accordance with its policies. Investment of surplus funds is made only with approved
counterparties in low-risk and highly liquid securities.

**Liquidity risk**
Prudent management of liquidity risk involves holding sufficient cash and transferable
securities, having access to finance through a sufficient sum of agreed credit facilities and
having the capacity to unwind market positions. Given the dynamic nature of underlying
businesses, the aim of the Group’s treasury department is to maintain funding availability by
ensuring that credit facilities are available.

Liquidity risk occurs as a result of the possibility that the Group may not have access to liquid
funds of a sufficient quantity and at an appropriate cost in order at all times to meet its
payment obligations.

Through MEIF5 Arena Holdings, S.A.U., the Group holds guarantees for its liquidity
requirements at all times through a Superior Senior Revolving Credit Facility (SSRCF) with a
limit of 75,000 thousand Euros. At 31 December 2018, the SSRCF is not in use (Note 20b).

**Financial information**
The Group’s recurring EBITDA (made up of recurring revenue and costs, without taking into
account the revenue and costs of residents and others) in the year 2018 was 84,954 thousands
of euros

As for the Company’s financial risk management policy, this is based on the Group managing
its capital in order to guarantee that it will be in a position to continue operating as a
profitable business, while maximising shareholder return by striking an optimum balance
between debt and equity.

The following are the main risks to which the Group is exposed:

- Liquidity risk: The Group establishes its treasury needs as part of its general policy through
the use of two tools: Treasury budget with a 12-month horizon with monthly detail and
updates and treasury budgets with a 30-day horizon with daily updates and details. These
tools identify treasury needs in volume and time and make plans for new financing needs.

- Credit risk: The Group maintains its cash and cash equivalents in financial institutions with
high credit ratings. It should furthermore be mentioned that there is no significant
concentration of credit risk with third parties.

- Interest rate risk: The interest rate risk of the Group arises basically from long-term
borrowings. The Group has contracted financial instruments that partially cover the risk of
possible interest rate hikes.

- Exchange rate risk: The Group has no significant exchange rate risk since the vast majority of
its assets and liabilities, income and expenses are denominated in euros.

The Group’s workforce is comprised of more than 2,175 workers, 34% of whom are women
and 66% men. The average age is 45 years.

-----

**Derivatives**
The Group has contracted financial instruments that partially cover the long-term risk of
possible interest rate hikes of outside resources. (See note 23)

**Environmental aspects**
Environmental activity is defined as any action intended to prevent, reduce or repair damage
to the environment.

The investments derived from environmental activities are valued at acquisition cost and are
activated as increased fixed asset expenses in the financial year in which they are incurred,
following the criteria described in note 2 regarding applicable accounting standards.

Costs derived from the protection and improvement of the environment are attributed to the
results for the financial year in which they are incurred, irrespective of the point when the
monetary or financial flow derived from the same occurs.

The provisions relative to probable or certain responsibilities, legal proceedings in process and
compensation or pending obligations of an undetermined amount of an environmental nature
not covered by contracted insurance policies are endowed when the liability or the obligation
establishing the compensation becomes effective.

At 31 December 2018, the costs or expenses incurred with regard to environmental aspects are
insignificant.

As for any such potential contingencies as may arise in the field of the environment, the
directors do not believe that they would have any significant impact on the enclosed financial
statements.

# Independent auditor’s report

To the Board of Managers of
Arena Luxembourg Investments S.`a r.l.
20, Boulevard Royal, level 4
L-2449 Luxembourg

## Opinion

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Arena Luxembourg Investments
S.`a r.l. and its subsidiaries (the ‘‘Group’’), which comprise the consolidated statement of
financial position as at 31 December 2017, and the consolidated statement of profit or loss, the
consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in
equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the period from 22 June 2017 to
31 December 2017, and the notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a
summary of significant accounting policies.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view
of the consolidated financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2017, and of its
consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the period from 22 June
2017 to 31 December 2017 in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
(‘‘IFRS’’) as adopted by the European Union.

## Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with the Law of 23 July 2016 on the audit profession
(the ‘‘Law of 23 July 2016’’) and with International Standards on Auditing (‘‘ISAs’’) as adopted
for Luxembourg by the ‘‘Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier’’ (‘‘CSSF’’). Our
responsibilities under those Law and standards are further described in the ‘‘responsibilities of
the ‘‘r´eviseur d’entreprises agr´e´e’’ for the audit of the consolidated financial statements’’
section of our report. We are also independent of the Group in accordance with the
International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for Professional
Accountants (‘‘IESBA Code’’) as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF together with the ethical
requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements, and have
fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities under those ethical requirements. We believe that the
audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
opinion.

## Responsibilities of the Board of Managers and those charged with governance for the consolidated financial statements

The Board of Managers is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these
consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union,
and for such internal control as the Board of Managers determines is necessary to enable the
preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement,
whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Board of

F-126


15JAN202021410539


-----

Managers is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern,
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of
accounting unless the Board of Managers either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease
operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

## Responsibilities of the ‘‘r´eviseur d’entreprises agr´e´e’’ for the audit of the consolidated financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial
statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and
to issue a report of the ‘‘r´eviseur d’entreprises agr´e´e’’ that includes our opinion. Reasonable
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in
accordance with the Law of 23 July 2016 and with ISAs as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF
will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud
or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably
be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these
consolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with the Law of 23 July 2016 and with ISAs as adopted for
Luxembourg by the CSSF, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional
skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial
statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive
to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis
for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is
higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.

- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of
accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Board of Managers.

- Conclude on the appropriateness of Board of Managers’ use of the going concern basis of
accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists
related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to
continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are
required to draw attention in our report of the ‘‘r´eviseur d’entreprises agr´e´e’’ to the related
disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to
modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the
date of our report of the ‘‘r´eviseur d’entreprises agr´e´e’’. However, future events or conditions
may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.

- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial
statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements
represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the
entities and business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated
financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of
the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

# Consolidated financial statements for the period from 22 June 2017 to 31 December 2017 Arena Luxembourg Investments S.`a r.l

## 1 Corporate information

Arena Luxembourg Investments S.`a r.l. (hereinafter ‘‘the Group’’) is made up of the ‘‘Parent
Company’’ Arena Luxembourg Investments S.`a r.l. and its subsidiaries. The ultimate parent is
MEIF5 LP.

Arena Luxembourg Investments S.`a r.l. (the ‘‘Company’’) was incorporated on 22 June 2017 and
is organised under the laws of Luxembourg as a ‘‘Soci´et´e de Responsabilit´e Limit´ee (S.`a r.l.), for
an unlimited period. The registered office of the Company is established at 46, Place Guillaume
II, L-1648, Luxembourg.

The Parent Company’s Board of Managers has considered the date of 22 June 2017 as the date
when the consolidated group was formed due to the fact on this date Arena Luxembourg
Investments S.`a r.l. was incorporated and following to that date on 28 July 2017, this Company
agreed to the 100% acquisition of Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A. along with its group
entities (together referred as ‘‘Empark Group’’).

Consequently, the Group is preparing consolidated financial statements for the first time for
the period from 22 June 2017 to 31 December 2017.

On 11 July 2017, the Company acquired 100% of the shares in MEIF 5 Arena Holdings, S.A.U
(previously known as Raglan Investments, SL).

On 26 September 2017, MEIF5 Arena Holdings, S.A.U. created Arena Luxembourg Finance S.`a r.l.

On 19 December 2017, when the conditions established in the Share Purchase Agreement
(‘‘SPA’’) were met, the Group acquired 100% of shares of the Empark group (Note 5), through
its subsidiary MEIF 5 Arena Holdings S.A.U. Empark group’s activity is mainly focused on hourly
parking regulated services, management and maintenance of on-street level car parks and a
public road towing services.

The concessions arrangements for this parking facilities stipulate that, to fulfil the concession
time frames, the car parks shall be returned to the granting entity in perfect conditions of use,
without any payment for provision of service for the Group.

Arena Luxembourg Investments S.`a r.l. is the parent company of the Group, made of 48
subsidiaries and 6 associated companies; it has stakes in 6 Unincorporated Temporary Joint
Ventures (hereinafter ‘‘UTJVs’’ or ‘‘UTE’’).

For the purpose of drawing up the consolidated financial statements, the assumption is that a
group exists if the parent company has one or more dependent companies, over which the
parent company exerts control either directly or indirectly.

The subsidiaries within the consolidation scope are listed in Note 3.1.

## 2 Basis of preparation

The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting
Standards Board (IASB) and as endorsed by the European Union.

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for
derivative financial instruments that have been measured at fair value. The carrying values of
recognised assets and liabilities that are designated as hedged items in fair value hedges that

F-135


-----

would otherwise be carried at amortised cost are adjusted to record changes in the fair values
attributable to the risks that are being hedged in effective hedge relationships. The
consolidated financial statements are presented in Euros and all values are rounded to the
nearest thousand (e000), except when otherwise indicated.

**Standards and interpretations approved by the European Union but not yet effective**

The standards and interpretations that are issued, but not yet effective, up to the date of
issuance of the Group’s financial statements will be adopted once they become effective. The
Standards and Interpretations are the following: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, IFRS 15 Revenue
from Contracts with Customers, IFRS 16 Leases, IFRS 10 and IAS 28 Sale or Contribution of
Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture—Amendments to IFRS 10 and
IAS 28, IFRS 2 Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions—
Amendments to IFRS 2, IFRIC Interpretation 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance
Consideration, IFRIC Interpretation 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments, IFRS 9
Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation—Amendments to IFRS 9.

According to the Group’s preliminary analysis, its application is not expected to be significant
for the consolidated financial statements.

## 3 Basis of consolidation

The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its
subsidiaries as for the period from 22 June 2017 to 31 December 2017. Control is achieved
when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the
investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.

Specifically, the Group controls an investee if, and only if, the Group has:

- Power over the investee (i.e., existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the
relevant activities of the investee)

- Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee.

- The ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns generally, there is a
presumption that a majority of voting rights results in control. To support this presumption
and when the Group has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee,
the Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power
over an investee, including:

- The contractual arrangement(s) with the other vote holders of the investee.

- Rights arising from other contractual arrangements.

- The Group’s voting rights and potential voting rights

The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate
that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control. Consolidation of a
subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the
Group loses control of the subsidiary. Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a subsidiary
acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated financial statements
from the date the Group gains control until the date the Group ceases to control the
subsidiary.

Profit or loss and each component of OCI are attributed to the equity holders of the parent of
the Group and to the non-controlling interests, even if this results in the non-controlling
interests having a deficit balance. When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial
statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with the Group’s
accounting policies. All intra-group assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash

F-136


-----

flows relating to transactions between members of the Group are eliminated in full on
consolidation.

A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a loss of control, is accounted for
as an equity transaction.

If the Group losses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the related assets (including
goodwill), liabilities, non-controlling interest and other components of equity, while any
resultant gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. Any investment retained is recognised at
fair value.

The consolidation has been carried out on the basis of the following criteria:

- Companies in which Arena Luxembourg Investments S.`a.r.l has effective control, were fully
consolidated.

- UTJVs are integrated into the individual financial statements using the proportional
integration method.

- Companies in which the holding of Arena Luxembourg Investments S.`a r.l. has significant
influence, are accounted using the equity method.

The assets and liabilities of the foreign companies have been converted into Euros on the basis
of the year-end exchange rate for the assets and liabilities and the year’s average exchange
rate for the income and expenditure accounts. The equity of consolidated companies that use
an operating currency other than the Euro have been converted using historical exchange
rates.

Third party shares in equity and the outcome of companies consolidated using the full
consolidation method are reflected under the ‘‘Non-controlling interests’’ of the consolidated
statement of financial position and ‘‘Profit attributable to Non-controlling interests’’ of the
consolidated statement of results, respectively. (Note 20).

a) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are those companies, including special purpose entities, over which the Group
exerts or could exert control, directly or indirectly, this being understood as the power to direct
the financial and operating policies of a business in order to derive economic benefits from its
activities.

In assessing whether the Group controls another companies, consideration is given to the
existence and impact of potential voting rights which can currently be exercised or converted.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date when control is transferred to the Group, and are
excluded from the consolidation perimeter as soon as such control ceases.

Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of acquisition
is the sum of the transferred consideration, which is valued at fair value as of the date of
acquisition, and the sum of the acquired company’s non-controlling interests, where applicable.
For each business combination, the Group chooses if it values the non-controlling interests of
the acquired company at fair value or the proportional portion of the acquired company’s
identifiable net assets.

Acquisition-related costs are expensed.

The business combinations in which the Group acquires control of one or several businesses
through the merger or division of various companies or through the acquisition of all asset
elements of a company or a part which constitutes one or several businesses, are recorded
through the acquisition method, which implies the accounting, on the acquisition date, of the

F-137


-----

identifiable acquired assets and liabilities assumed at fair value, so long as it can be measured
reliably.

When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the assumed financial assets and financial
liabilities for classification based on contractual agreements, economic conditions and other
relevant conditions which exist on the acquisition date.

Any contingent consideration which must be transferred by the acquiring company is
recognised at fair value on the date of acquisition.

Goodwill is valued initially at cost (being the surplus of the sum of the transferred
consideration, the recorded non-controlling interest and any holding held previously over the
net value of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities). If the fair value of the acquired net
assets exceeds the value of the transferred consideration, the Group performs a new
assessment to ensure that all acquired assets and assumed liabilities have been identified
correctly, and reviews the applied procedures to value the amounts recognised on the date of
acquisition. If this new assessment results in a surplus for the fair value of the acquired net
assets on the accumulated total of the transferred consideration, the difference is recognised as
a profit in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.

After initial recognition, goodwill is recorded at cost minus any loss due to accumulated
impairment. For the purposes of the impairment test, goodwill acquired through a business
combination is assigned, from the date of acquisition, to each Group cash generating unit
which benefits from the combination, regardless of whether there are other acquired company
assets or liabilities assigned to these units.

When goodwill forms part of a cash generating unit and part of this unit’s transactions are
cancelled, the goodwill associated with these disposed transactions are included in the book
value of the transaction to determine the profit or loss of the transaction disposal. Goodwill
cancelled in these circumstances is valued based on the relative values of the disposed
transaction and the portion of the cash generating unit which is retained.

The business combinations for which, at the financial year end date, the necessary valuation
process to apply the acquisition method has not been concluded, are entered using provisional
values. These values must be adjusted within a maximum period of one year from the
acquisition date. Adjustments which are recognised to supplement the initial accounting are
completed retroactively, so that the resulting values are those which would be derived after
having this information initially, adjusting the comparative figures as a result.

b) Investments in associates
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence. Significant influence is
the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee, but is
not control or joint control over those policies.

The considerations made in determining significant influence is similar to those necessary to
determine control over subsidiaries. The Group’s investments in its associate is accounted for
using the equity method.

Under the equity method, the investment in an associate is initially recognised at cost. The
carrying amount of the investment is adjusted to recognise changes in the Group’s share of net
assets of the associate since the acquisition date. Goodwill relating to the associate is included
in the carrying amount of the investment and is not tested for impairment separately.

The statement of profit or loss reflects the Group’s share of the results of operations of the
associate. Any change in OCI of those investees is presented as part of the Group’s OCI. In
addition, when there has been a change recognised directly in the equity of the associate, the
Group recognises its share of any changes, when applicable, in the statement of changes in

F-138


-----

equity. Unrealised gains and losses resulting from transactions between the Group and the
associate is eliminated to the extent of the interest in the associate.

The aggregate of the Group’s share of profit or loss of an associate is shown on the face of the
statement of profit or loss outside operating profit and represents profit or loss after tax and
non-controlling interests in the subsidiaries of the associate.

The financial statements of the associate are prepared for the same reporting period as the
Group. When necessary, adjustments are made to bring the accounting policies in line with
those of the Group.

After application of the equity method, the Group determines whether it is necessary to
recognise an impairment loss on its investment in its associate. At each reporting date, the
Group determines whether there is objective evidence that the investment in the associate is
impaired. If there is such evidence, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the
difference between the recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying value, and then
recognises the loss within ‘Share of profit of an associate’ in the statement of profit or loss.

Upon loss of significant influence over the associate, the Group measures and recognises any
retained investment at its fair value. Any difference between the carrying amount of the
associate upon loss of significant influence and the fair value of the retained investment and
proceeds from disposal is recognised in profit or loss.

c) UTJVs
The consolidated statement of financial position and the consolidated statements of profit or
loss of these companies have been consolidated proportionally in the consolidated statement
of financial position and in the consolidated statement of profit or loss as of 31 December
2017.

The Group recognises the proportional part corresponding to it of assets controlled jointly and
liabilities incurred jointly in accordance with the percentage holding, along with assets
attached to joint operations which are under control and liabilities incurred as a result of joint
business.

Similarly, the consolidated statement of results recognises the part corresponding to income
generated and expenses incurred by the joint business. Additionally, the costs incurred with
regard to the holding in the joint business are also recorded.

Non-realised outcomes deriving from reciprocal transactions are eliminated in proportion to the
holding, in addition to the amounts of reciprocal assets, liabilities, income, expenses and cash
flows.

During 2017, the proportional integration method has been used to consolidate UTJV DornierHostele ´on, UTJV Torrellobeta, UTJV Valls, UTJV Palma, UTJV Devas 1 and UTJV Devas 2.

## 4 Significant accounting policies

**4.1 Standards and interpretations approved by the European Union, which must be applied to**
**this period**

The Group will adopt any standards, interpretations and modifications issued by the IASB,
which are applicable in European Union as of the date of the presentation of the consolidated
financial statements. Even though the Group is currently analysing the impact, based on the
preliminary results, the application is not expected to be significant for the consolidated
financial statements.

**4.2 Accounting estimates and judgments**

The preparation of the Group’s consolidated financial statements requires management to
make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues,
expenses, assets and liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures, and the disclosure of
contingent liabilities. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in
outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset or liability
affected in future periods.

Due to the business combinations described in Note 3, the accounting estimates and judgments
have been assessed following the IFRS 3 standard during the Purchase Price Allocation analysis.

**Judgments**

In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management has made the
following judgements, which have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the
consolidated financial statements:

**_Working capital and going concern_**
As of 31 December 2017, the group has working capital of 1,588 thousand Euros.

F-142


-----

The Group uses a centralised cash flow system. Additionally, the group has credit facilities and
other financial resources available to meet its future cash needs (Note 41).

Therefore, the Board considers it appropriate to prepare these consolidated financial
statements based on the going concern principle, which involves the realization of assets and
settlement of liabilities to the amounts and according to the classification with which they are
shown in the consolidated financial statements.

**_Exchange rate—currency adoption_**
The Board of Managers considers the Euro as the currency that most fairly represents the
economic effect of the underlying transactions, events and conditions. The Euro is the currency
in which the Group measures its performance and reports its results, as well as the currency in
which the majority of the business is undertaken by the Group subsidiaries and the Company
received equity financing from its shareholder.

**_Business combination_**
As explained in Note 5, the Group has acquired Empark Group which resulted in an aggregate
amount of goodwill of 172,772 thousand Euros, being the excess of the aggregate of the
consideration transferred over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. In
the view of the management, embedded intangible assets within the acquired businesses
(together with a related contract, identifiable assets or liabilities) or arising from contractual or
legal rights have been separated within the consolidated financial statements.

Under non-current and current liabilities of the consolidated statement of financial position,
the Group has recorded provisions totalling 59,623 thousand euros and 7,482 thousand euros,
respectively (Note 25). Making assumptions and estimates regarding the discount rate and the
expected costs to be incurred is an essential part of determining the value of these provisions.

These estimates were made based on the best information available on 31 December 2017
regarding the events analysed. However, it is possible that events that may occur in the future
will require modification of these estimates, which would be carried out as required in
accordance with IAS 8.

For the purposes of accounting for the liabilities as per business combination (Note 3), any
matters classified by the Group as probable risk have been recorded as long-term provisions, as
well as those which are classified as possible risk, considering the percentage occurrence in
each case, in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations (Note 3).

Considerable management judgement is necessary in the identification and valuation of
identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed (including purchase price allocation). Such
judgement is exercised based on careful analysis of the acquired business, their financial and
commercial arrangements and expected economic benefits. The premise of value used in the
valuation of intangibles for a purchase price allocation is fair value. The estimate of fair value
has been determined based on the income approach. The income approach is the most
common technique used to value intangibles, both because it captures expected future returns
to the owners and because it is able to estimate value for unique assets when a market
transaction is not available. Market data may often be obtained to estimate the income stream
that is likely to be generated from particular assets.

**Estimates and assumptions**
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at
the reporting date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are described below. The Group
based its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the consolidated financial
statements were prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments,

F-143


-----

however, may change due to market changes or circumstances arising beyond the control of
the Group. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur.

**_Assessment of possible impairment losses on certain non-financial assets_**
The valuation of non-current assets other than financial assets requires the use of estimates to
determine their fair value for the purpose of evaluating any potential impairment, especially
for goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life. In order to establish this fair
value, the Company’s Board of Managers estimate the future cash flows expected from the
assets or the cash generating units to which they belong and apply an appropriate discount
rate in order to calculate the current value of those cash flows. Future cash flows depend on
whether budgets for the forthcoming five financial years are met, whereas the discount rates
depend on the interest rate and risk premium associated with each cash generating unit.
Note 8 details the hypothesis used to calculate the value-in-use of the cash generating units in
which goodwill is included. As the acquisition date of Empark Group was very close to these
consolidated financial statements, in view of the Board of Managers, the Purchase Price
Allocation analysis gives a fair view of recoverable amounts of non-financial assets as at
31 December 2017.

**_Taxes_**
Uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation of complex tax regulations, changes in tax
laws, and the amount and timing of future taxable income. Given the wide range of
international business relationships and the long-term nature and complexity of existing
contractual agreements, differences arising between the actual results and the assumptions
made, or future changes to such assumptions, could necessitate future adjustments to tax
estimation. The Group establishes provisions and recognises deferred taxes, based on
reasonable estimates, for possible consequences of audits by the tax authorities of the
respective countries in which it operates and estimated timing differences on reported assets
and liabilities (including for acquired businesses).

The amount of such provisions is based on various factors, such as experience of previous tax
audits and differing interpretations of tax regulations by the taxable entities and the
responsible tax authority. Such differences of interpretation may arise on a wide variety of
issues depending on the conditions prevailing in the respective domicile of the Group
companies.

Deferred tax assets are recorded for all deductible temporary differences, negative tax bases
pending compensation and deductions pending application, for those where it is likely that the
Group will have future taxable income that allows the application of these assets. The Board of
Managers have to make significant estimates to establish the sum of deferred tax assets which
may be recorded, considering the amounts and dates on which future tax earnings will be
obtained and the reversal period of temporary taxable differences.

The Group has not carried forward losses on which no differed tax assets are recognized.

**4.3 Resource management policies**
The Group manages its investments after a review and evaluation of potentially attractive
projects from the environmental, social security and labour-related, commercial, financial and
economic points of view with the aim of achieving sustainable and balanced growth.

The Group’s Sole Shareholder seeks the desired balance between the expected return on
investments and the acceptable risk when carrying out these activities.

**4.4 Intangible assets**
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of
intangible assets acquired in a business combination is their fair value at the date of
acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any

F-144


-----

accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Internally generated intangibles,
excluding capitalised development costs, are not capitalised and the related expenditure is
reflected in profit or loss in the period in which the expenditure is incurred.

The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as either finite or indefinite.

Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over the useful economic life and assessed for
impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The
amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite useful
life are reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period. Changes in the expected useful
life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset
are considered to modify the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and are treated
as changes in accounting estimates. The amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite
lives is recognised in the statement of profit or loss in the expense category that is consistent
with the function of the intangible assets.

Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortised, but are tested for impairment
annually, either individually or at the cash-generating unit level. The assessment of indefinite
life is reviewed annually to determine whether the indefinite life continues to be supportable.
If not, the change in useful life from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis. Gains
or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference
between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in
the statement of profit or loss when the asset is derecognised.

a) Concessions
‘‘Concessions’’ in the consolidated statement of financial position includes mainly concession
arrangements for the construction and operation of car park spaces concessions arrangements,
within the scope of IFRIC 12. This standard defines the treatment of public-to-private service
concession arrangements when:

- the grantor controls or regulates what services the operator must provide with the
infrastructure, to whom it must provide them, and at what price; and

- the grantor controls any significant residual interest in the infrastructure at the end of the
term of the arrangement.

In general, a distinction must be drawn between two clearly different phases: the first, in
which the operator provides and/or subcontracts construction or upgrade services which are
recognised as intangible or financial assets by reference to the stage of completion pursuant to
IAS 11, Construction Contracts; and a second phase, in which the concession operator provides
a series of maintenance and/or operation services in relation to the aforementioned
infrastructure, which are recognised in accordance with IAS 18, Revenue.

In these concession arrangements, the operator acts as a service provider; specifically, on the
one hand, providing infrastructure construction and upgrade services and, on the other,
providing operation and maintenance services over the term of the arrangement. The
consideration received for these services is recognised according to the type of contractual
right received:

- When the right to charge a price to the users of the public service is received and this right is
not unconditional but is rather contingent on the extent to which the users actually use the
service, the consideration for the construction or upgrade service is recognised using the
intangible asset model, in which the demand risk is borne by the concession operator. This
model applies to the great majority of the Group’s car park spaces concession operators.

- When an unconditional right to receive cash or another financial asset from (or on behalf of)
the grantor is received, and the grantor has little or no discretion to avoid payment, the
consideration for the construction or upgrade service is recognised as a financial asset under,

F-145


-----

using the financial asset model, in which the concession operator does not bear any demand
risk (it is paid even if the infrastructure is not used, given that the grantor guarantees the
concession operator that it will pay a fixed or determinable amount or cover any shortfall).
This model is not extensively applied within the Group.

- When there is a combination of the two aforementioned arrangements, the bifurcated
model is applied to each component of the arrangement.

The model applicable to most of the main concessions operated by the Group is the intangible
asset model, since the consideration received generally consists of the right to charge users a
fee for the use of the public service, and the fee depends on users’ effective use thereof.

The useful life is defined as being in line with concessions periods.

_Intangible asset model_
Concessions are generally recognized as assets measured at the total amount of the payments
made to obtain them, which includes the costs directly allocable to construction incurred until
they are ready for use (studies and designs, compulsory purchases, reinstatement of services,
project execution, project management and administration expenses, installation work and
building construction and similar costs) and the related portion of other indirectly allocable
costs, to the extent that they relate to the construction phase.

Cost also includes the borrowing costs incurred before the assets are ready for their intended
use arising from the borrowings arranged to finance the related projects. Capitalised
borrowing costs arise from the funds borrowed specifically for the acquisition of an asset.

For concessions classified as intangible assets, provisions for dismantling, removal and
restoration and any work to upgrade the infrastructure or increase its capacity the revenue
from which is provided for in the initial contract are capitalised at the start of the concession
and the amortisation of these assets and the interest cost relating to the provisions are
recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss. Also, provisions for the costs to be
incurred in replacing and repairing the infrastructure are systematically recognised in profit or
loss as the corresponding obligation is incurred.

Upkeep and maintenance expenses that do not lead to a lengthening of the useful life of the
assets or an increase in their production capacity are expensed currently.

Concessions have a finite useful life and their cost, if recognised as an intangible asset, is
recognised in profit or loss through its amortisation over the concession term, using the
straight-line method for such purpose.

Lastly, at least at each reporting date, it is periodically determined whether there is any
indication that an asset or group of assets might have become impaired so that an impairment
loss can be recognised or reversed in order to adjust the carrying amount of the assets to their
recoverable amount.

b) Computer applications
Licences acquired for computer programs from third parties are capitalised on the basis of the
costs incurred in acquiring them and preparing the specific program for use.

The Group depreciates its computer applications on a straight-line basis, distributing the cost of
the assets between the estimated useful lives of the same, which is three years.

**4.5 Property, plant and equipment**
Construction in progress is stated at cost, net of accumulated impairment losses, if any. Plant
and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment
losses, if any. Such cost includes the cost of replacing part of the plant and equipment and
borrowing costs for long-term construction projects if the recognition criteria are met. When

F-146


-----

significant parts of plant and equipment are required to be replaced at intervals, the Group
depreciates them separately based on their specific useful lives. Likewise, when a major
inspection is performed, its cost is recognised in the carrying amount of the plant and
equipment as a replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied. All other repair and
maintenance costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred. The present value of the
expected cost for the decommissioning of an asset after its use is included in the cost of the
respective asset if the recognition criteria for a provision are met.

Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets,
as follows:

**Estimated**
**useful life**

Buildings and other constructions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 50
Machinery, installations and tools . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10
Furniture and fittings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10

Other . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3

An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant part initially recognised is
derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or
disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference
between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the
statement of profit or loss when the asset is derecognised.

The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of property, plant and equipment
are reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.

**4.6 Impairment of non-financial assets**
The Group assesses, at each reporting date, whether there is an indication that an asset may be
impaired. If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required,
the Group estimates the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the
higher of an asset’s or Cash Generating Unit’s (‘‘CGU’’) fair value less costs of disposal and its
value in use. The recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset
does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or
groups of assets. When the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable
amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.

In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value
using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of
money and the risks specific to the asset. In determining fair value less costs of disposal, recent
market transactions are taken into account. If no such transactions can be identified, an
appropriate valuation model is used. These calculations are corroborated by valuation
multiples, quoted share prices for publicly traded companies or other available fair value
indicators.

The Group bases its impairment calculation on detailed budgets and forecast calculations,
which are prepared separately for each of the Group’s CGUs to which the individual assets are
allocated. These budgets and forecast calculations generally cover a period of five years. A
long-term growth rate is calculated and applied to project future cash flows after the fifth
year.

Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in the statement of profit or loss in
expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset, except for properties
previously revalued with the revaluation taken to OCI. For such properties, the impairment is
recognised in OCI up to the amount of any previous revaluation.

F-147


-----

For assets excluding goodwill, an assessment is made at each reporting date to determine
whether there is an indication that previously recognised impairment losses no longer exist or
have decreased. If such indication exists, the Group estimates the asset’s or CGU’s recoverable
amount.

A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the
assumptions used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss
was recognised. The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not
exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been
determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior
years. Such reversal is recognised in the statement of profit or loss unless the asset is carried at
a revalued amount, in which case, the reversal is treated as a revaluation increase.

Goodwill is tested for impairment annually and when circumstances indicate that the carrying
value may be impaired.

Impairment is determined for goodwill by assessing the recoverable amount of each CGU (or
group of CGUs) to which the goodwill relates. When the recoverable amount of the CGU is less
than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised. Impairment losses relating to
goodwill cannot be reversed in future periods.

Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually at the CGU
level, as appropriate, and when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be
impaired.

**4.7 Interest costs**
Financial expenses directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of intangible asset,
property, plant and equipment requiring a period of time longer than one year in order to be
fit for use are included in the cost until such time as the asset is in operational condition.

**4.8 Financial instruments—initial recognition and subsequent measurement**
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a
financial liability or equity instrument of another entity.

**I) Financial assets**

_Initial recognition and measurement_
Financial assets are classified, at initial recognition, as financial assets at fair value through
profit or loss, loans and receivables, held-to-maturity investments or as derivatives designated
as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate. All financial assets are recognised
initially at fair value plus, in the case of financial assets not recorded at fair value through
profit or loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset.

Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame
established by regulation or convention in the market place (regular way trades) are
recognised on the trade date, i.e., the date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the
asset.

_Subsequent measurement_
For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets are mainly classified in two
categories:

- Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss

- Loans and receivables

_Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss_
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss include financial assets held for trading and
financial assets designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss. Financial

F-148


-----

assets are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling or
repurchasing in the near term. Derivatives, including separated embedded derivatives, are also
classified as held for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments as
defined by IAS 39.

Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are carried in the statement of financial
position at fair value with net changes in fair value presented as finance costs (negative net
changes in fair value) or finance income (positive net changes in fair value) in the statement of
profit or loss.

_Loans and receivables_
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments
that are not quoted in an active market. After initial measurement, such financial assets are
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) method, less
impairment. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on
acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is
included in finance income in the statement of profit or loss. The losses arising from
impairment are recognised in the statement of profit or loss in finance costs for loans and in
cost of sales or other operating expenses for receivables.

_Derecognition_
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar
financial assets) is primarily derecognised (i.e., removed from the Group’s consolidated
statement of financial position) when:

- The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired

- The Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an
obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party
under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; and either (a) the Group has transferred substantially all
the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Group has neither transferred nor retained
substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.

When the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered
into a ‘pass-through’ arrangement, it evaluates if, and to what extent, it has retained the risks
and rewards of ownership. When it has neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the
risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the Group continues to
recognise the transferred asset to the extent of its continuing involvement. In that case, the
Group also recognises an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability
are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the Group has retained.

Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is
measured at the lower of the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount
of consideration that the Group could be required to repay.

_Impairment of financial assets_
The Group assesses, at each reporting date, whether there is objective evidence that a financial
asset or a group of financial assets is impaired. An impairment exists if one or more events that
has occurred since the initial recognition of the asset (an incurred ‘loss event’), has an impact
on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or the group of financial assets that
can be reliably estimated. Evidence of impairment may include indications that the debtors or a
group of debtors is experiencing significant financial difficulty, default or delinquency in
interest or principal payments, the probability that they will enter bankruptcy or other
financial reorganisation and observable data indicating that there is a measurable decrease in
the estimated future cash flows, such as changes in arrears or economic conditions that
correlate with defaults.

F-149


-----

**II) Financial liabilities**

_Initial recognition and measurement_
Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value
through profit or loss, loans and borrowings, payables, or as derivatives designated as hedging
instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate.

All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and
borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs.

The Group’s financial liabilities include trade and other payables, loans and borrowings
including bank overdrafts, financial guarantee contracts and derivative financial instruments.

_Subsequent measurement_
The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as described below:

_Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss_
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for
trading and financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through
profit or loss.

Financial liabilities are classified as held for trading if they are incurred for the purpose of
repurchasing in the near term. This category also includes derivative financial instruments
entered into by the Group that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge
relationships as defined by IAS 39. Separated embedded derivatives are also classified as held
for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments.

Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognised in the statement of profit or loss.

Financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss are
designated at the initial date of recognition, and only if the criteria in IAS 39 are satisfied. The
Group has not designated any financial liability as at fair value through profit or loss.

_Loans and borrowings_
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at
amortised cost using the EIR method. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the
liabilities are derecognised as well as through the EIR amortisation process.

Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and
fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included as finance
costs in the statement of profit or loss.

_Derecognition_
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or
cancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same
lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially
modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original
liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying
amounts is recognised in the statement of profit or loss.

**4.9 Fair value measurement**
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value
measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the
liability takes place either:

- In the principal market for the asset or liability

F-150


-----

- In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or
liability

The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Group.

The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market
participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act
in their economic best interest.

The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which
sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable
inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.

All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements
are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level
input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:

Level 1—Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities

Level 2—Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair
value measurement is directly or indirectly observable

Level 3—Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair
value measurement is unobservable

For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements at fair value on a
recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the
hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to
the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.

For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group has determined classes of assets and
liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the
level of the fair value hierarchy, as explained above.

**4.10 Inventories**
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.

Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less
estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.

The cost of finished products and products in progress, which corresponds to developments in
progress and those completed, includes costs incurred in the construction of car parks intended
for assignment of usage.

Parking spaces held for sale and included in inventories are valued at the acquisition price or
production cost.

The appropriate value restatements are made when the cost exceeds the market value and are
recognised as an expense in the consolidated statement of profit or loss. If the circumstances
leading to the value correction cease to exist, the reversal is recognised as income in the
consolidated statement of profit or loss.

**4.11 Cash and short-term deposits**
Cash and short-term deposits in the statement of financial position comprise cash at banks and
on hand and short-term deposits with a maturity of three months or less, which are subject to
an insignificant risk of changes in value.

For the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist
of cash and short-term deposits, as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts as they
are considered an integral part of the Group’s cash management.

F-151


-----

**4.12 Equity**
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of
new shares are recognised in equity as a deduction, net of taxes.

Treasury stock is recorded in equity as a reduction in equity when acquired, with no result
being recorded in the consolidated statement of profit or loss for its sale or cancellation.
Income and expenditure arising from transactions with treasury stock are recorded directly in
equity as a reduction in reserves.

**4.13 Redundancy compensation**
Redundancy compensation is paid to employees as a result of a decision by the Group to
terminate their employment contracts prior to the normal retirement age, or if the employee
agrees to retire voluntarily in exchange for such provisions. The Group recognises these
provisions when a proven commitment has been agreed for the termination of the
employment of workers, in accordance with a detailed, formal plan, with no possible
withdrawal, or an agreement has been reached to provide redundancy compensation as a
result of an offer made in order to encourage voluntary redundancies. Those provisions which
are not payable within twelve months of the date of the balance sheet are discounted at their
current value.

**4.14 Transactions with related parties**
In general, operations with related parties are accounted for at the initial point at their fair
value. In any case, if the agreed price differs from the fair value, the difference is recorded in
accordance with the economic reality of the operation. The subsequent valuation is made in
accordance with the terms set forth in the applicable regulations.

**4.15 Government grants**
Government grants are recognised where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be
received and all attached conditions will be complied with. When the grant relates to an
expense item, it is recognised as income on a systematic basis over the periods that the related
costs, for which it is intended to compensate, are expensed. When the grant relates to an
asset, it is recognised as income in equal amounts over the expected useful life of the related
asset.

**4.16 Provisions**

_General_
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a
result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits
will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of
the obligation. When the Group expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for
example, under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset, but
only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense relating to a provision is
presented in the statement of profit or loss net of any reimbursement.

If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current
pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When discounting
is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.

_Contingent liabilities recognised in a business combination_
A contingent liability recognised in a business combination is initially measured at its fair value.
Subsequently, it is measured at the higher of the amount that would be recognised in
accordance with the requirements for provisions above or the amount initially recognised less
(when appropriate) cumulative amortisation recognised in accordance with the requirements
for revenue recognition.

F-152


-----

_Provisions required under IFRIC 12_
These provisions relates to the provisions associated with future work, essentially in concessions
accounted for using the intangible asset, that the Group’s concession operators are required to
carry out as a result of the use of the infrastructure in order to maintain and restore it.

These provisions are recognised on the basis of the best estimate of future disbursements
required to carry out the next cycle of work on the infrastructure, with the provisions being
systematically recognised during each cycle with a charge to the consolidated statement of
profit or loss on the basis of the usage of the infrastructure (with an average duration at each
of the concessions of between seven and ten years) until the work is actually carried out. These
future disbursements are estimated on the basis of technical studies, the quantification of
which is subject, inter alia, to the situation of the infrastructure when the work is performed
and to fluctuations in construction service price indexes. Consequently, the annual cash
outflows associated with these provisions vary according to the duration of each work cycle.

**4.17 Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting**

_Initial recognition and subsequent measurement_
The Group uses derivative financial instruments, such as forward currency contracts, interest
rate swaps and forward commodity contracts, to hedge its foreign currency risks, interest rate
risks and commodity price risks, respectively. Such derivative financial instruments are initially
recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are
subsequently remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair
value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative.

The purchase contracts that meet the definition of a derivative under IAS 39 are recognised in
the statement of profit or loss as cost of sales. Commodity contracts that are entered into and
continue to be held for the purpose of the receipt or delivery of a non-financial item in
accordance with the Group’s expected purchase, sale or usage requirements are held at cost.

Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives are taken directly to
profit or loss, except for the effective portion of cash flow hedges, which is recognised in OCI
and later reclassified to profit or loss when the hedge item affects profit or loss.

For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as:

- Fair value hedges when hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised
asset or liability or an unrecognised firm commitment

- Cash flow hedges when hedging the exposure to variability in cash flows that is either
attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly
probable forecast transaction or the foreign currency risk in an unrecognised firm
commitment

- Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation

At the inception of a hedge relationship, the Group formally designates and documents the
hedge relationship to which it wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management
objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. The documentation includes identification of
the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged
and how the entity will assess the effectiveness of changes in the hedging instrument’s fair
value in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item’s fair value or cash flows
attributable to the hedged risk. Such hedges are expected to be highly effective in achieving
offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows and are assessed on an ongoing basis to
determine that they actually have been highly effective throughout the financial reporting
periods for which they were designated.

F-153


-----

Hedges that meet the strict criteria for hedge accounting are accounted for, as described
below:

_Fair value hedges_
The change in the fair value of a hedging instrument is recognised in the statement of profit
or loss as a finance cost. The change in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the
risk hedged is recorded as part of the carrying value of the hedged item and is also recognised
in the statement of profit or loss as a finance cost.

For fair value hedges relating to items carried at amortised cost, any adjustment to carrying
value is amortised through profit or loss over the remaining term of the hedge using the EIR
method. EIR amortisation may begin as soon as an adjustment exists and no later than when
the hedged item ceases to be adjusted for changes in its fair value attributable to the risk
being hedged.

If the hedged item is derecognised, the unamortised fair value is recognised immediately in
profit or loss.

When an unrecognised firm commitment is designated as a hedged item, the subsequent
cumulative change in the fair value of the firm commitment attributable to the hedged risk is
recognised as an asset or liability with a corresponding gain or loss recognised in profit or loss.

_Cash flow hedges_
The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in OCI in the
cash flow hedge reserve, while any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the
statement of profit or loss.

Amounts recognised as OCI are transferred to profit or loss when the hedged transaction
affects profit or loss, such as when the hedged financial income or financial expense is
recognised or when a forecast sale occurs. When the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial
asset or non-financial liability, the amounts recognised as OCI are transferred to the initial
carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability.

If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or
rollover (as part of the hedging strategy), or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, or when
the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss
previously recognised in OCI remains separately in equity until the forecast transaction occurs
or the foreign currency firm commitment is met.

**4.18 Taxes**

_Corporate income tax_
Corporate income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be
recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute
the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date in the
countries where the Group operates and generates taxable income.

Current income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and
not in the statement of profit or loss. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in
the tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations are subject to
interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate.

_Deferred tax_
Deferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences between the tax
bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes at the
reporting date.

F-154


-----

Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except:

- When the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or
liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the
transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss

- In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries,
associates and interests in joint arrangements, when the timing of the reversal of the
temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences
will not reverse in the foreseeable future

Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, the carried forward
unused tax credits and any unused tax losses. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent
that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary
differences, and the carried forward unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised,
except:

- When the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the
initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination
and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or
loss.

- In respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries,
associates and interests in joint arrangements, deferred tax assets are recognised only to the
extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable
future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be
utilised.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to
the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow
all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are
re-assessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become
probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in
the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws)
that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

Deferred taxes related to items recognised outside the consolidated statement of profit or loss
are recorded OCI or directly in equity.

Tax benefits acquired as part of a business combination, but not satisfying the criteria for
separate recognition at that date, are recognised subsequently if new information about facts
and circumstances change. The adjustment is either treated as a reduction in goodwill (as long
as it does not exceed goodwill) if it was incurred during the measurement period or recognised
in profit or loss.

The Group offsets deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities if and only if it has a legally
enforceable right to set off current tax assets and current tax liabilities and the deferred tax
assets and deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority
on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities which intend either to settle
current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities
simultaneously, in each future period in which significant amounts of deferred tax liabilities or
assets are expected to be settled or recovered.

F-155


-----

_Value added tax (VAT)_
Expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of VAT, except:

- When the VAT incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the
taxation authority, in which case, the VAT is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of
the asset or as part of the expense item, as applicable.

- When receivables and payables are stated with the amount of VAT included

The net amount of VAT recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as
part of receivables or payables in the statement of financial position.

**4.19 Foreign currencies**
The assets and liabilities of the companies denominated in foreign currencies are converted
using the closure exchange rate method according to the following rates:

**31/12/2017** **31/12/2017**

**Exchange rate** **average** **close**

Euro / UK Pound . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 0.8767 0.8872
Euro / Turkish lira . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4.1206 3.5464

The Group’s consolidated financial statements are presented in Euros (EUR), which is also the
parent company’s functional currency. For each entity, the Group determines the functional
currency and items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured using that
functional currency. The Group uses the direct method of consolidation and on disposal of a
foreign operation, the gain or loss that is reclassified to profit or loss reflects the amount that
arises from using this method.

_Transactions and balances_
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded by the Group’s entities at their
respective functional currency spot rates at the date the transaction first qualifies for
recognition.

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the
functional currency spot rates of exchange at the reporting date.

Differences arising on settlement or translation of monetary items are recognised in profit or
loss with the exception of monetary items that are designated as part of the hedge of the
Group’s net investment in a foreign operation. These are recognised in OCI until the net
investment is disposed of, at which time, the cumulative amount is reclassified to profit or loss.
Tax charges and credits attributable to exchange differences on those monetary items are also
recorded in OCI.

Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are
translated using the exchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items
measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the
date when the fair value is determined. The gain or loss arising on translation of non-monetary
items measured at fair value is treated in line with the recognition of the gain or loss on the
change in fair value of the item (i.e., translation differences on items whose fair value gain or
loss is recognised in OCI or profit or loss are also recognised in OCI or profit or loss,
respectively).

_Group companies_
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into Euros at
the rate of exchange prevailing at the reporting date and their statements of profit or loss are
translated at exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. The exchange

F-156


-----

differences arising on translation for consolidation are recognised in OCI. On disposal of a
foreign operation, the component of OCI relating to that particular foreign operation is
reclassified to profit or loss.

Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation and any fair value adjustments
to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities arising on the acquisition are treated as assets
and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the spot rate of exchange at the
reporting date.

**4.20 Revenue recognition**
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to
the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured, regardless of when the payment is
received. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable,
taking into account contractually defined terms of payment and excluding taxes or duty. The
Group has concluded that it is the principal in all of its revenue arrangements since it is the
primary obligor in all the revenue arrangements, has pricing latitude, and is also exposed to
inventory and credit risks.

**a) Revenue by business line:**
a.1) Off-street and resident spaces

a.2) On-street

a.3) Selling of parking spaces

a.4) Management

**a.1) Off-street**
Off-street car park income is entered when the hourly parking rate is paid and, in the case
of season ticket-holders, on an accrual basis. Mixed car parks (with off-street and resident
spaces) record income as follows: in the case of off-street spaces, in the manner described
in the preceding paragraph; and in case of resident spaces, the amount received is recorded
in the consolidated statement of profit and loss at the time of the transfer of concession
usage of the corresponding parking spaces. The cost of residential spaces is recognised in
inventories and are transcribed to the consolidated statement of profit and loss on the date
of the transfer of the concession of usage.

**a.2) On-street**
Income from the on-street car parks service (ORA) is mainly based on the amounts
regarding to the cost of providing the service plus a percentage, generally between 1%
and 3%, of the surplus between that cost and the cash collected. In some on-street car
parks contracts, income is obtained as a fixed percentage of the take, payable by the Local
Council. It is recognised in the accounts at the time the service is provided.

**a.3) Selling of parking spaces**
This business involves the construction of car parks whose spaces are sold directly to
customers during the time frame of the concession. The sales and costs are not recorded
until the parking space is delivered, which tends to coincide with the signature of the
contract or, exceptionally, with the public deed of sale.

**a.4) Management**
This business line regards to the management of contracts of a third party car park, mainly
located in airports, ports and shopping malls.

**4.21 Leases**
The determination of whether an arrangement is (or contains) a lease is based on the
substance of the arrangement at the inception of the lease. The arrangement is, or contains, a

F-157


-----

lease if fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset (or assets)
and the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset (or assets), even if that asset is (or those
assets are) not explicitly specified in an arrangement.

_Group as a lessee_
A lease is classified at the inception date as a finance lease or an operating lease. A lease that
transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership to the Group is
classified as a finance lease.

Finance leases are capitalised at the commencement of the lease at the inception date fair
value of the leased property or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease liability
so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance
charges are recognised in finance costs in the statement of profit or loss.

A leased asset is depreciated over the useful life of the asset. However, if there is no
reasonable certainty that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term, the
asset is depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset and the lease
term.

An operating lease is a lease other than a finance lease. Operating lease payments are
recognised as an operating expense in the statement of profit or loss on a straight-line basis
over the lease term.

_Group as a lessor_
Leases in which the Group does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of
ownership of an asset are classified as operating leases. Initial direct costs incurred in
negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased
asset and recognised over the lease term on the same basis as rental income. Contingent rents
are recognised as revenue in the period in which they are earned.

**4.22 Current versus non-current classification**
The Group presents assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position based on
current/non-current classification.

An asset is current when it is:

- Expected to be realised or intended to be sold or consumed in the normal operating cycle

- Held primarily for the purpose of trading

- Expected to be realised within twelve months after the reporting period

- Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability
for at least twelve months after the reporting period.

- All other assets are classified as non-current.

A liability is current when:

- It is expected to be settled in the normal operating cycle

- It is held primarily for the purpose of trading

- It is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period

- There is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least twelve
months after the reporting period

F-158


-----

The Group classifies all other liabilities as non-current.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current assets and liabilities.

## 5 Business combination

On 19 December 2017, the subsidiary MEIF5 Arena Holdings, S.A.U. acquired 100% of Empark
Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A., the parent company of Empark Group. The business
combination was recorded on this date, considering the Purchase Price Allocation (‘‘PPA’’)
analysis prepared by an independent expert following the IFRS 3 guidelines. The result of the
analysis is shown in the independent report dated in 26 March 2018.

The following assumptions have been considered:

- It has been determined that the contacts will generate cash flows with terms up to maturity;
this period is between 5 and 50 years, depending on the concession.

- The associated income and expenditure forecasts were performed in accordance with the
following general criteria:

  - In the case of income, in order to estimate price variations, consideration was given to
the estimated variation in the consumer price index (CPI) for each of the countries where
the investments are operational, the appropriate price review formulae as set forth in
the concession contracts on the basis of the price variation indices and/or any specific
correction factors which may apply.

Ramp up during the first 2-5 years of the concession has been taken into account in the
case of new contracts, depending on the specific analysis of each contract; subsequently,
an evolution in income similar to previous income has been estimated.

  - In terms of expenditure, the evolution thereof was calculated on the basis of the
corresponding expected evolution in the CPI rates, in addition to the forecast evolution
of the business.

  - Consideration was also given to the cost of works to be performed in order to maintain
and improve infrastructure, based on the best estimate available according to the
group’s experience, and taking into consideration the forecast evolution of the business.

  - The forecast cash flows obtained on the basis of the projected income and expenditure,
in accordance with the aforementioned criteria, were updated at the discount rate
resulting from adding to the long-term cost of money the risk premium assigned by the
market to the country where the group performs its operations, the risk premium
assigned by the market to each business (both based on a long-term vision), along with
the financial structure of the group or cash-generating unit in question. A discount rate
of 7.1% was applied.

  - On the other hand, provisions for fixed fees at a risk-free discount rate have been
updated.

F-160


-----

The adjustments mainly refer to the following:

A) Elimination of Goodwill previously recognised in consolidation of Empark Group (148,102)
thousand Euros.

B) Adjustment of fair value of assets, which led to a higher value in intangible assets of
377,739 thousand Euros, property, plant and equipment of 112,065 thousand Euros and
assets using the equity method for 64 thousand Euros. The tax effect of this asset
revaluation is reflected as liabilities through deferred taxes for 116,977 thousand Euros.

C) The outcome of deferred tax assets corresponds to elimination of goodwill pending tax
amortisation for the sum of 1,424 thousand Euros, and an update of provisions for fees for
the sum of 2,098 thousand Euros.

D) Adjustment of Madrid ORA contract linearization for the sum of (14,057) thousand Euros
for clients and (4,224) thousand Euros for suppliers, and remuneration pending payment.
Consequently, the fair value of the trade receivables amounts to 26,565 thousand Euros,
net of provision for doubtful debts.

E) Corresponds to adjustment of provisions due to regularisation of discount rate for
provisions for fees (IFRIC 12) for the sum of 8,393 thousand Euros and on the other hand
recording of other tax provisions in relation to those tax contingencies with a probable
and possible risk of success, at the estimated percentage of occurrence, for the sum of
6,252 thousand Euros (Note 25).

F) Adjustment for non-controlling interests (NCI) for the sum of 12,176 thousand Euros. The
fair value of the NCI has been valued as their proportionate part of identifiable net assets
of the acquired, which means that goodwill recognized, relates only to the controlling
interest acquired.

From this business combination analysis a goodwill of 172,772 thousand Euros arose (Note 8).
The goodwill arising from acquisition comprises the value of expected synergies from the
acquisition of Empark group. None of the goodwill recognised is expected to be deducted for
income tax purposes.

Fundamentally, the ‘‘concessions’’ heading includes the cost of construction or acquisition of
operating rights of different establishments, as well as initial fees paid for certain car park
operation concessions.

F-161


-----

These public authority concessions are recognised as assets at cost minus the cumulative
amortisation and the cumulative amount of recognised valuation corrections for impairment.

The ‘‘Concessions’’ heading also includes access rights paid by means of a concession fee during
the period of the concession. In this case the concessions are included under assets at the
current value of the minimum agreed payments without taking contingent payments into
consideration.

During the 2017 period, the main movement relates to the business combination described in
Note 5.

The provision for amortisation during 2017 (period from 19[th] December to 31[st] December) was
(732) thousand Euros.

As of 31 December 2017, the average maturity period of the different off-street parking
contracts is 25 years, and the average maturity period for on-street parking contracts (ORA) is
6 years.

As of 31 December 2017, there are not totally amortised intangible assets in use.

It is the Group policy to take out Insurance Policies which provide adequate coverage for the
items which are part of the intangible assets.

The Group contracts derivative financial instruments (interest rate swaps) with different third
parties, mainly financial institutions with suitable credit ratings (‘‘investment grade’’), to cover
interest rate fluctuations of their bank loans. Valuation techniques based on observable market
data have been used for their valuation. The most frequently applied valuation techniques
include future price models, using calculations of the actual value of expected cash flows.
Models take a range of data into account, including credit ratings and interest rate curves.

As of 31 December 2017, Aparcamientos Guipuzcoanos, S.A. holds an interest rate derivative to
manage exposure to fluctuations in syndicated credit rates contracted at variable rates. This
contract fixes a range of interest payments and charges depending on the current market
interest rate (Euribor). As of 31 December 2017, the Group has recorded the valuation of this
product, for a sum of 1,214 thousand Euros.

As of 31 December 2017, Concha Parking, S.A. holds an interest rate derivative to manage

contracts fix a range of interest payments and charges depending on the current market
interest rate (Euribor). As of 31 December 2017, the Group has recorded the valuation of this
product, for a sum of 2,453 thousand Euros.

The valuation of the derivatives owned by the Group as of 31 December 2017 is (3,668)
thousand Euros (Note 19).

The Group classifies valuations at fair value using a hierarchy that reflects the relevance of the
variables employed in the valuations as per the following levels:

a) non-adjusted quoted prices on active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1).

b) variables other than the quoted prices included in Level 1, which can be observed for the
asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices), or indirectly (that is, derived from prices)
(Level 2), and

c) variables, used for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market date
(unobservable variables -Level 3).

The only Group assets or liabilities valued at fair value are these derivatives (interest rate
swaps), found in category b) of the previous breakdown (Level 2).

## 24 Other non-current financial liabilities

1—Income generated by off-street car parks

Income from off-street car parks corresponds to income generated through the use of parking
spaces owned by the Group or held under an administrative concession. Off-street car park
income is entered when the hourly parking rate is paid and, in the case of season ticketholders, on an accrual basis.

2—Income generated by the sale of residents’ parking spaces

This business involves the construction of car parks whose spaces are sold directly to the end
customer during the time frame of the concession. The sales and costs are not recorded until
the parking space is delivered, which coincides with the signature of the contract.

3—Income generated by on-street car parks (ORA)

Income from the ORA parking meter service is mainly based on the sum corresponding to the
cost of providing the service plus a percentage, generally between 1% and 3%, of the surplus
between that cost and the funds collected. In some ORA contracts the income is earned at a
fixed rate (service cost) regardless of the funds collected, which are paid to the Council. It is
recognised in the accounts at the time the service is provided.

4—Income generated through other services.

The Group also specialises in the provision of other services linked to end-to-end management
of car parking and urban and inter-urban mobility, such as: Management of control of access
to nature reserves, provision of temporary parking services at trade fairs and mass attendance
events, combined park and bus services around airports.

## 39 Environmental commitments

Environmental activity is defined as any action intended to prevent, reduce or repair damage
to the environment.

The investments derived from environmental activities are valued at acquisition cost and are
capitalised as increased intangible assets and property, plant and equipment expenses in the
period in which they are incurred, following the criteria described in Note 4 regarding
applicable accounting standards.

Costs derived from the protection and improvement of the environment are attributed to the
results for the period in which they are incurred, irrespective of the point when the monetary
or financial flow derived from the same occurs.

The provisions relative to probable or certain responsibilities, legal proceedings in process and
compensation or pending obligations of an undetermined amount of an environmental nature
not covered by contracted insurance policies are endowed when the liability or the obligation
establishing the compensation becomes effective.

## 41 Financial instruments: risk management objectives and policies

The Group’s activities are exposed to various financial risks: market risk (including exchange
rate risk, interest rate risk and price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.

Risk management is controlled by the Group which identifies, evaluates and covers financial
risks in accordance with the policies approved by the Boards of the Group companies. The
Board provides policies for overall risk management and for specific areas such as exchange
rate risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, use of derivative and non-derivative instruments and
the investment of surplus liquidity.

The financial risks to which the Group is exposed include those derived from the guarantees
and bonds required in order for the group to undertake its activities.

As of 31 December 2017, the Group had in place bank guarantees with third parties and
guarantee commitments with other Group companies in order to engage in its business.

_Capital management_
Capital includes equity attributable to the equity holders of the parent.

The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to ensure that it maintains a
strong credit rating and healthy capital ratios in order to support its business and maximise
shareholder value.

The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in
economic conditions. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the
dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares.

**Market risk: Exchange rate risk**
Management has established an exchange rate risk management policy for foreign currencies
other than the operating currency. Forward contracts, negotiated by the finance department,
are used to manage exchange rate risk arising from future trade transactions and recognised
assets and liabilities. Exchange rate risk arises where future commercial transactions or
recognised assets or liabilities are quoted in a currency other than the group’s operating
currency.

The Group has no significant exchange rate risk, as most of its assets and liabilities, income and
expenses, are expressed in Euros. Companies that, due to their origin (United Kingdom and
Turkey), use the currency of their country of origin, also express their assets, liabilities, income
and expenses in that currency.

**Market risk: Interest rate risk from cash flows and fair value**
At 31 December 2017, if the interest rates on outside resources quoted in Euros had been
50 basis points higher/lower, with all other variables remaining constant, the result after taxes
for the period would not have varied significantly as a result of an increase/decrease in the cost
of interest on variable-rate loans.

The Group carries out the appropriate interest rate hedges by contracting an IRS (Interest Rate
Swap) (Note 23).

Interest rate risk occurs as a result of possible losses caused by variations in the fair value or
future cash flows of a financial instrument as a result of changes in market interest rates. The
Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in interest rates mainly arises from variable interest
rate credits and loans.

Out of the 525,718 thousand Euros of long term debt in 2017 (541,611 of debt minus
15,893 thousand Euros of amortised cost), only 149,305 thousand Euros are influenced by the
Euribor. Below are details of net non-current funding classified based on interest rate structure:

**2017**

**Thousand EUR**
Non-current funding of non-group third parties at a variable interest rate . . . . 149,305
Non-current funding of non-group third parties at a variable interest rate with
interest rate hedge . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 26,413
Non-current funding of non-group third parties at a fixed interest rate . . . . . . 350,000

**525,718**

Variable interest rate funding is Euribor-linked.

**Interest rate sensitivity**
As of December 31, 2017 if the interest rates were increased/decreased up to 50 basis points,
with no other changes considered, the consolidated results would amount to 1,000 Euros,
mainly due to a higher/lower financial expense, regarding to loans at variable rates.

**Credit risk**
Credit risk is handled by the Group. Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative
financial instruments and deposits held in banks and financial institutions, along with
wholesale and retail clients including pending accounts receivable and committed transactions.
With respect to banks and financial institutions, only financial institutions that are known to be
reputable and solvent are accepted.

Credit risk occurs as a result of the possible loss caused by a breach of contractual obligations
by the Group’s counterparts, in other words the possibility of not recovering financial assets at
the value accounted for and within the established deadlines.

Maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 December is as follows:

**2017**

**Thousand EUR**
**Non-current:**

**106,024**

Breakdowns are periodically prepared showing the age of each balance receivable, which serve
as a basis for managing their collection. Debt with an age in excess of 1 year is reviewed on an
annual basis and a monthly insolvency provision is allocated.

Details of customer credit risk concentration at 31 December 2017 are shown below:

**2017**

**No. of customers** **Amount**

**Thousand EUR**
With balance in excess of 100 thousand Euros . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 24 17,225
With balance between 10 thousand Euros and 100 thousandEuros 69 3,042
With balance between 1 thousand Euros and 10 thousand Euros . 243 1,139
With balance less than 1 thousand Euros . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 809 126

**Total (Note 11 a) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **1,145** **21,532**

The customer credit risk is almost fully concentrated in governmental institutions.

Credit risks from balances with banks and financial institutions are managed by the Group in
accordance with its policies. Investment of surplus funds is made only with approved
counterparties in low-risk and highly liquid securities.

**Liquidity risk**
Prudent management of liquidity risk involves holding sufficient cash and transferable
securities, having access to finance through a sufficient sum of agreed credit facilities and
having the capacity to unwind market positions. Given the dynamic nature of underlying
businesses, the aim of the Group’s treasury department is to maintain funding availability by
ensuring that credit facilities are available.

Liquidity risk occurs as a result of the possibility that the Group may not have access to liquid
funds of a sufficient quantity and at an appropriate cost in order at all times to meet its
payment obligations.

Through MEIF5 Arena Holdings, S.A.U., the Group holds guarantees for its liquidity
requirements at all times through a Superior Senior Revolving Credit Facility (SSRCF) with a
limit of 75,000 thousand Euros. At 31 December 2017, the SSRCF is not in use (Note 21b).

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared, in all
material respects, in accordance with the criteria for financial reporting described in note 2.

**Basis for opinion**
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for
the audit of the consolidated financial statements section of our report.

We are independent of the Group in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board
for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code), and we have
fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the IESBA Code.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
basis for our opinion.

**Emphasis of matter—Basis of accounting and restriction on distribution and use**
We draw attention to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, which describes the
basis of accounting. As explained in the aforementioned note, the consolidated financial
statements have not been prepared in accordance with legal requirements and have been
prepared for the purpose of presenting the Empark Group’s consolidated income and cash flow
statements for full year ended December 31, 2017. As a result, the consolidated financial
statements may not be suitable for another purpose. Our report is intended solely for the
purpose previously mentioned and should not be distributed to or used by parties other than
the aforementioned addressees. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.

**Other matter**
The consolidated financial statements have been audited applying International Standards on
Auditing. This report can under no circumstances be considered an audit carried out in
accordance with prevailing audit regulations in Spain.

**Responsibilities of management for the consolidated financial statements**
Management is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in
accordance with the criteria for financial reporting described in note 2, and for such internal
control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to
going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either
intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do
so.

**Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements**
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial
statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and
to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit
conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in
the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users
taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain
professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial
statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive
to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from
fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery,
intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.

Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of
accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.

Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of
accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty
exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability
to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are
required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the
consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our
opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our

auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to
continue as a going concern

We communicate with management of the Group regarding, among other matters, the
planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant
deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

The consolidated financial statements of Arena Luxembourg Investments S.`a r.l. were prepared
by the Board of Directors on May 18, 2018.

The accompanying Consolidated Special Purpose Financial Position Income and Cash Flow
Statement have been prepared for the purpose of presenting the Empark Group’s consolidated
income and cash flow statements for full year ended December 31, 2017.

The 2017 Consolidated Special Purpose Financial Position Income and cash flow statements do
not include information on the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the notes
thereto, solely disclosing the relevant and necessary notes for an appropriate understanding of
the consolidated special purpose financial position, income and cash flow statements.

The Consolidated Special Purpose Financial Position Income and Cash Flow Statement have
been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments that have
been measured at fair value. The carrying values of recognised assets and liabilities that are
designated as hedged items in fair value hedges that would otherwise be carried at amortised
cost are adjusted to record changes in the fair values attributable to the risks that are being
hedged in effective hedge relationships. The consolidated Consolidated Special Purpose
Financial Position Income and Cash Flow Statement are presented in Euros and all values are
rounded to the nearest thousand (e000), except when otherwise indicated.

**Standards and interpretations approved by the European Union but not yet effective**
The standards and interpretations that are issued, but not yet effective, up to the date of
issuance of the Group’s financial statements will be adopted once they become effective. The
Standards and Interpretations are the following: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, IFRS 15 Revenue
from Contracts with Customers, IFRS 16 Leases, IFRS 10 and IAS 28 Sale or Contribution of
Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture—Amendments to IFRS 10 and
IAS 28, IFRS 2 Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions—
Amendments to IFRS 2, IFRIC Interpretation 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance
Consideration, IFRIC Interpretation 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments, IFRS 9
Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation—Amendments to IFRS 9.

According to the Group’s analysis, its application has not been significant in subsequent periods
for the Consolidated Special Purpose Financial Position Income and Cash Flow Statement.

**B.** **Group accounting**
The Consolidated Special Purpose Financial Position, Income and Cash Flow Statement comprise
the Financial Position Income and Cash Flow Statement of the Company and its subsidiaries as
for the period from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017. Control is achieved when the Group
is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the
ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.

Specifically, the Group controls an investee if, and only if, the Group has:

- Power over the investee (i.e., existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the
relevant activities of the investee)

- Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee.

- The ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns generally, there is a
presumption that a majority of voting rights results in control. To support this presumption

F-202


-----

and when the Group has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee,
the Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power
over an investee, including:

  - The contractual arrangement(s) with the other vote holders of the investee.

  - Rights arising from other contractual arrangements.

  - The Group’s voting rights and potential voting rights

The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate
that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control. Consolidation of a
subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the
Group loses control of the subsidiary. Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a subsidiary
acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated financial statements
from the date the Group gains control until the date the Group ceases to control the
subsidiary.

Profit or loss and each component of OCI are attributed to the equity holders of the parent of
the Group and to the non-controlling interests, even if this results in the non-controlling
interests having a deficit balance. When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial
statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with the Group’s
accounting policies. All intra-group assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash
flows relating to transactions between members of the Group are eliminated in full on
consolidation.

A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a loss of control, is accounted for
as an equity transaction. If the Group losses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the
related assets (including goodwill), liabilities, non-controlling interest and other components of
equity, while any resultant gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. Any investment retained
is recognised at fair value.

The consolidation has been carried out on the basis of the following criteria:

- UTJVs are integrated into the individual Financial Position Income and Cash Flow Statement
using the proportional integration method.

- Companies in which the Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios S.A.U. has significant influence,
are accounted using the equity method.

The assets and liabilities of the foreign companies have been converted into Euros on the basis
of the year-end exchange rate for the assets and liabilities and the year’s average exchange
rate for the income and expenditure accounts. The equity of consolidated companies that use
an operating currency other than the Euro have been converted using historical exchange
rates.

Third party shares in equity and the outcome of companies consolidated using the full
consolidation method are reflected under the ‘‘Non-controlling interests’’ of the consolidated
statement of financial position income and ‘‘Profit attributable to Non-controlling interests’’ of
the consolidated statement of results, respectively.

a) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are those companies, including special purpose entities, over which the Group
exerts or could exert control, directly or indirectly, this being understood as the power to direct
the financial and operating policies of a business in order to derive economic benefits from its
activities.

In assessing whether the Group controls another companies, consideration is given to the
existence and impact of potential voting rights which can currently be exercised or converted.

F-203


-----

Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date when control is transferred to the Group, and are
excluded from the consolidation perimeter as soon as such control ceases.

Business Combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of acquisition
is the sum of the transferred consideration, which is valued at fair value as of the date of
acquisition, and the sum of the acquired company’s non-controlling interests, where applicable.
For each business combination, the Group chooses if it values the non-controlling interests of
the acquired company at fair value or the proportional portion of the acquired company’s
identifiable net assets.

Acquisition-related costs are expensed.
The business combinations in which the Group acquires control of one or several businesses
through the merger or division of various companies or through the acquisition of all asset
elements of a company or a part which constitutes one or several businesses, are recorded
through the acquisition method, which implies the accounting, on the acquisition date, of the
identifiable acquired assets and liabilities assumed at fair value, so long as it can be measured
reliably.

When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the assumed financial assets and financial
liabilities for classification based on contractual agreements, economic conditions and other
relevant conditions which exist on the acquisition date. Any contingent consideration which
must be transferred by the acquiring company is recognised at fair value on the date of
acquisition.

Goodwill is valued initially at cost (being the surplus of the sum of the transferred
consideration, the recorded non-controlling interest and any holding held previously over the
net value of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities). If the fair value of the acquired net
assets exceeds the value of the transferred consideration, the Group performs a new
assessment to ensure that all acquired assets and assumed liabilities have been identified
correctly, and reviews the applied procedures to value the amounts recognised on the date of
acquisition. If this new assessment results in a surplus for the fair value of the acquired net
assets on the accumulated total of the transferred consideration, the difference is recognised as
a profit in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.

After initial recognition, goodwill is recorded at cost minus any loss due to accumulated
impairment. For the purposes of the impairment test, goodwill acquired through a business
combination is assigned, from the date of acquisition, to each Group cash generating unit
which benefits from the combination, regardless of whether there are other acquired company
assets or liabilities assigned to these units.

When goodwill forms part of a cash generating unit and part of this unit’s transactions are
cancelled, the goodwill associated with these disposed transactions are included in the book
value of the transaction to determine the profit or loss of the transaction disposal. Goodwill
cancelled in these circumstances is valued based on the relative values of the disposed
transaction and the portion of the cash generating unit which is retained.

The business combinations for which, at the financial year end date, the necessary valuation
process to apply the acquisition method has not been concluded, are entered using provisional
values. These values must be adjusted within a maximum period of one year from the
acquisition date. Adjustments which are recognised to supplement the initial accounting are
completed retroactively, so that the resulting values are those which would be derived after
having this information initially, adjusting the comparative figures as a result.

b) Investments in associates
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence. Significant influence is
the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee, but is

F-204


-----

not control or joint control over those policies. The considerations made in determining
significant influence is similar to those necessary to determine control over subsidiaries. The
Group’s investments in its associate is accounted for using the equity method.

Under the equity method, the investment in an associate is initially recognised at cost. The
carrying amount of the investment is adjusted to recognise changes in the Group’s share of net
assets of the associate since the acquisition date. Goodwill relating to the associate is included
in the carrying amount of the investment and is not tested for impairment separately.

The statement of profit or loss reflects the Group’s share of the results of operations of the
associate. Any change in OCI of those investees is presented as part of the Group’s OCI. In
addition, when there has been a change recognised directly in the equity of the associate, the
Group recognises its share of any changes, when applicable, in the statement of changes in
equity. Unrealised gains and losses resulting from transactions between the Group and the
associate is eliminated to the extent of the interest in the associate.

The aggregate of the Group’s share of profit or loss of an associate is shown on the face of the
statement of profit or loss outside operating profit and represents profit or loss after tax and
non-controlling interests in the subsidiaries of the associate.

The Financial Position Income and Cash Flow Statement of the associate are prepared for the
same reporting period as the Group. When necessary, adjustments are made to bring the
accounting policies in line with those of the Group.

After application of the equity method, the Group determines whether it is necessary to
recognise an impairment loss on its investment in its associate. At each reporting date, the
Group determines whether there is objective evidence that the investment in the associate is
impaired. If there is such evidence, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the
difference between the recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying value, and then
recognises the loss within ‘Share of profit of an associate’ in the statement of profit or loss.

Upon loss of significant influence over the associate, the Group measures and recognises any
retained investment at its fair value. Any difference between the carrying amount of the
associate upon loss of significant influence and the fair value of the retained investment and
proceeds from disposal is recognised in profit or loss.

c) UTJVs
The Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, the Consolidated Statements of Profit or Loss
and the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flow of these companies have been consolidated
proportionally in the consolidated statement of financial position and in the consolidated
statement of profit or loss as of 31 December 2017.

The Group recognises the proportional part corresponding to it of assets controlled jointly and
liabilities incurred jointly in accordance with the percentage holding, along with assets
attached to joint operations which are under control and liabilities incurred as a result of joint
business.

Similarly, the consolidated statement of results recognises the part corresponding to income
generated and expenses incurred by the joint business. Additionally, the costs incurred with
regard to the holding in the joint business are also recorded.

Non-realised outcomes deriving from reciprocal transactions are eliminated in proportion to the
holding, in addition to the amounts of reciprocal assets, liabilities, income, expenses and cash
flows.

During 2017, the proportional integration method has been used to consolidate UTJV DornierHostele ´on, UTJV Torrellobeta, UTJV Valls, UTJV Palma, UTJV Devas 1 and UTJV Devas 2.

_Functional and presentation currency_
The Group’s consolidated Financial Position Income and Cash Flow Statement are presented in
Euros (EUR), which is the Company’s functional currency and of most of its subsidiaries. For
each entity, the Group determines the functional currency and items included in the Financial
Position Income and Cash Flow Statement of each entity are measured using that functional
currency. The Group uses the direct method of consolidation and on disposal of a foreign
operation, the gain or loss that is reclassified to profit or loss reflects the amount that arises
from using this method.

The assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies are converted
using the closure exchange rate method according to the following rates:

**Exchange rate** **31/12/2017** **31/12/2017**

**average** **close**
Euro / UK Pound . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 0.8767 0.8872
Euro / Turkish lira . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4.1206 3.5464

_Transactions and balances in currencies other than the functional currency_
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded by the Group’s entities at their
respective functional currency spot rates at the date the transaction first qualifies for
recognition.

F-208


-----

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the
functional currency spot rates of exchange at the reporting date.

Differences arising on settlement or translation of monetary items are recognised in profit or
loss with the exception of monetary items that are designated as part of the hedge of the
Group’s net investment in a foreign operation. These are recognised in OCI until the net
investment is disposed of, at which time, the cumulative amount is reclassified to profit or loss.
Tax charges and credits attributable to exchange differences on those monetary items are also
recorded in OCI.

Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are
translated using the exchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items
measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the
date when the fair value is determined. The gain or loss arising on translation of non-monetary
items measured at fair value is treated in line with the recognition of the gain or loss on the
change in fair value of the item (i.e., translation differences on items whose fair value gain or
loss is recognised in OCI or profit or loss are also recognised in OCI or profit or loss,
respectively).

_Translation of financial information in currencies other than the functional currency_
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into Euros at
the rate of exchange prevailing at the reporting date and their statements of profit or loss are
translated at exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. The exchange
differences arising on translation for consolidation are recognised in OCI. On disposal of a
foreign operation, the component of OCI relating to that particular foreign operation is
reclassified to profit or loss.

Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation and any fair value adjustments
to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities arising on the acquisition are treated as assets
and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the spot rate of exchange at the
reporting date.

**D.** **Intangible assets**
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of
intangible assets acquired in a business combination is their fair value at the date of
acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any
accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Internally generated intangibles,
excluding capitalised development costs, are not capitalised and the related expenditure is
reflected in profit or loss in the period in which the expenditure is incurred.

The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as either finite or indefinite.

Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over the useful economic life and assessed for
impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The
amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite useful
life are reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period. Changes in the expected useful
life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset
are considered to modify the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and are treated
as changes in accounting estimates. The amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite
lives is recognised in the statement of profit or loss in the expense category that is consistent
with the function of the intangible assets.

Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortised, but are tested for impairment
annually, either individually or at the cash-generating unit level. The assessment of indefinite
life is reviewed annually to determine whether the indefinite life continues to be supportable.
If not, the change in useful life from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis.

F-209


-----

Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference
between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in
the statement of profit or loss when the asset is derecognised.

a) Concessions
‘‘Concessions’’ in the consolidated statement of financial position includes mainly concession
arrangements for the construction and operation of car park spaces concessions arrangements,
within the scope of IFRIC 12. This standard defines the treatment of public-to-private service
concession arrangements when:

- the grantor controls or regulates what services the operator must provide with the
infrastructure, to whom it must provide them, and at what price; and

- the grantor controls any significant residual interest in the infrastructure at the end of the
term of the arrangement.

In these concession arrangements, the operator acts as a service provider; specifically, on the
one hand, providing infrastructure construction and upgrade services and, on the other,
providing operation and maintenance services over the term of the arrangement. The
consideration received for these services is recognised according to the type of contractual
right received:

- When the right to charge a price to the users of the public service is received and this right is
not unconditional but is rather contingent on the extent to which the users actually use the
service, the consideration for the construction or upgrade service is recognised using the
intangible asset model, in which the demand risk is borne by the concession operator.

- When an unconditional right to receive cash or another financial asset from (or on behalf of)
the grantor is received, and the grantor has little or no discretion to avoid payment, the
consideration for the construction or upgrade service is recognised as a financial asset under,
using the financial asset model, in which the concession operator does not bear any demand
risk (it is paid even if the infrastructure is not used, given that the grantor guarantees the
concession operator that it will pay a fixed or determinable amount or cover any shortfall).

- When there is a combination of the two aforementioned arrangements, the bifurcated
model is applied to each component of the arrangement.

The model applicable to most of the main concessions operated by the Group is the intangible
asset model, since the consideration received generally consists of the right to charge users a
fee for the use of the public service, and the fee depends on users’ effective use thereof.

The useful life is defined as being in line with concessions periods.

_Intangible asset model_
Concessions are generally recognized as assets measured at the total amount of the payments
made to obtain them, which includes the costs directly allocable to construction incurred until
they are ready for use (studies and designs, compulsory purchases, reinstatement of services,
project execution, project management and administration expenses, installation work and
building construction and similar costs) and the related portion of other indirectly allocable
costs, to the extent that they relate to the construction phase.

Cost also includes the borrowing costs incurred before the assets are ready for their intended
use arising from the borrowings arranged to finance the related projects.

For concessions classified as intangible assets, provisions for dismantling, removal and
restoration and any work to upgrade the infrastructure or increase its capacity the revenue
from which is provided for in the initial contract are capitalised at the start of the concession
and the amortisation of these assets and the interest cost relating to the provisions are
recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss. Also, provisions for the costs to be
incurred in replacing and repairing the infrastructure are systematically recognised in profit or
loss as the corresponding obligation is incurred.

F-210


-----

Upkeep and maintenance expenses that do not lead to a lengthening of the useful life of the
assets or an increase in their production capacity are expensed as incurred.

Concessions have a finite useful life and their cost, if recognised as an intangible asset, is
recognised in profit or loss through its amortisation over the concession term, using the
straight-line method for such purpose.

Lastly, at least at each reporting date, it is periodically determined whether there is any
indication that an asset or group of assets might have become impaired so that an impairment
loss can be recognised or reversed in order to adjust the carrying amount of the assets to their
recoverable amount.

b) Computer applications
Licences acquired for computer programs from third parties are capitalised on the basis of the
costs incurred in acquiring them and preparing the specific program for use.

The Group depreciates its computer applications on a straight-line basis, distributing the cost of
the assets between the estimated useful lives of the same, which is three years.

**E.** **Property, plant and equipment**
Construction in progress is stated at cost, net of accumulated impairment losses, if any. Plant
and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment
losses, if any. Such cost includes the cost of replacing part of the plant and equipment and
borrowing costs for long-term construction projects if the recognition criteria are met. When
significant parts of plant and equipment are required to be replaced at intervals, the Group
depreciates them separately based on their specific useful lives. Likewise, when a major
inspection is performed, its cost is recognised in the carrying amount of the plant and
equipment as a replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied. All other repair and
maintenance costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred. The present value of the
expected cost for the decommissioning of an asset after its use is included in the cost of the
respective asset if the recognition criteria for a provision are met.

Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets,
as follows:

**Estimated**
**useful life**

Buildings and other constructions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 50
Machinery, installations and tools . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10
Furniture and fittings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10
Vehicles . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6
Other . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3

An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant part initially recognised is
derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or
disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference
between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the
statement of profit or loss when the asset is derecognised.

The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of property, plant and equipment
are reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.

**F.** **Impairment of non-financial assets**
The Group assesses, at each reporting date, whether there is an indication that an asset may be
impaired. If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required,
the Group estimates the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the
higher of an asset’s or Cash Generating Unit’s (‘‘CGU’’) fair value less costs of disposal and its

F-211


-----

value in use. The recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset
does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or
groups of assets. When the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable
amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.

In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value
using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of
money and the risks specific to the asset. In determining fair value less costs of disposal, recent
market transactions are taken into account. If no such transactions can be identified, an
appropriate valuation model is used. These calculations are corroborated by valuation
multiples, quoted share prices for publicly traded companies or other available fair value
indicators.

The Group bases its impairment calculation on detailed budgets and forecast calculations,
which are prepared separately for each of the Group’s CGUs to which the individual assets are
allocated. These budgets and forecast calculations generally cover a period of five years. A
long-term growth rate is calculated and applied to project future cash flows after the fifth
year.

Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in the statement of profit or loss in
expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset, except for properties
previously revalued with the revaluation taken to OCI. For such properties, the impairment is
recognised in OCI up to the amount of any previous revaluation.

For assets excluding goodwill, an assessment is made at each reporting date to determine
whether there is an indication that previously recognised impairment losses no longer exist or
have decreased. If such indication exists, the Group estimates the asset’s or CGU’s recoverable
amount. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in
the assumptions used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment
loss was recognised. The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not
exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been
determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior
years. Such reversal is recognised in the statement of profit or loss unless the asset is carried at
a revalued amount, in which case, the reversal is treated as a revaluation increase.

Goodwill is tested for impairment annually and when circumstances indicate that the carrying
value may be impaired. Impairment is determined for goodwill by assessing the recoverable
amount of each CGU (or group of CGUs) to which the goodwill relates. When the recoverable
amount of the CGU is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised.
Impairment losses relating to goodwill cannot be reversed in future periods.

Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually at the CGU
level, as appropriate, and when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be
impaired.

**G.** **Interest costs**
General and specific borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or
construction of intangible assets or property, plant and equipment requiring a period of time
longer than one year in order to be fit for use are included in the cost until such time as the
asset is in operational condition.

**H.** **Financial instruments**
As from 1 January 2017 financial assets have been classified as financial assets at amortised cost
or financial assets at fair value through profit or loss or through other comprehensive income.

F-212


-----

Amortized Cost: assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash
flows represent solely payments of principal and interest. Interest income from these financial
assets is included in finance income using the effective interest rate method.

Exchange gains and losses and impairments related to the financial assets are immediately
recognized in the Consolidated Income Statement.

Fair value through other comprehensive income (‘‘FVOCI’’): assets that are held for collection of
contractual cash flows and for selling the financial assets, where the assets’ cash flows
represent solely payments of principal and interest. Interest income from these financial assets
is included in finance income using the effective interest rate method.

Fair value through profit and loss (‘‘FVPL’’): assets that do not meet the criteria for amortized
cost or FVOCI. Changes in fair value of financial instruments at FVPL are immediately
recognized in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

The classification depends on the business model used by the Group to manage financial assets
and the contractual terms of cash flows.

All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of financial assets not
recorded at fair value, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial
asset.

All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and
borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs.

Financial assets and liabilities are recognized and derecognized on their trade date (the date
that the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.).

Impairment of financial assets
The new impairment model requires an impairment provision to be recognised based on
expected loss rather than incurred loss as under IAS 39. IFRS 9 requires recognising impairment
on all financial instruments not measured at fair value.

The application of the credit risk impairment model based on expected loss has not had a
significant impact at 1 January 2017.

Hedge accounting
The Group has elected to apply the new hedging model under IFRS 9. This new model
attempts to align accounting criteria with risk management. Additionally, it increases flexibility
in hedge accounting and in terms of hedging effectiveness, eliminates the requirement for
retrospective assessment.

The Group has conducted an analysis, identifying differences in processes and has implemented
the necessary changes in processes and controls to ensure the correct documentation of
hedging derivatives in accordance with IFRS 9.

The Group’s non derivative financial instruments classifies according to the following
categories:

- Financial instruments at fair value through profit and loss.

- Loans and receivables.

- Available for sale assets.

- Held to maturity.

- Other financial liabilities.

The classification depended on the nature and purpose that the Group set to the financial
instrument.

Financial assets and liabilities were recognized and derecognized on their trade date.

F-213


-----

Financial assets were initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs, except for those
financial assets classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.

Financial liabilities, including borrowings, were initially measured at fair value, net of
transaction costs and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest
method, with interest expense recognized on an effective yield basis.

**I.** **Fair value measurement**
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value
measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the
liability takes place either:

- In the principal market for the asset or liability

- In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or
liability

The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Group.

The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market
participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act
in their economic best interest.

The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which
sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable
inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.

All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements
are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level
input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:

Level 1—Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities

Level 2—Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair
value measurement is directly or indirectly observable

Level 3—Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair
value measurement is unobservable

For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements at fair value on a
recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the
hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to
the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.

For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group has determined classes of assets and
liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the
level of the fair value hierarchy, as explained above.

**J.** **Inventories**
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.

Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less
estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.

The cost of finished products and products in progress, which corresponds to developments in
progress and those completed, includes costs incurred in the construction of car parks intended
for assignment of usage.

F-214


-----

Parking spaces held for sale and included in inventories are valued at the acquisition price or
production cost.

The appropriate value restatements are made when the cost exceeds the market value and are
recognised as an expense in the consolidated statement of profit or loss. If the circumstances
leading to the value correction cease to exist, the reversal is recognised as income in the
consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

**K.** **Cash and short-term deposits**
Cash and short-term deposits in the statement of financial position comprise cash at banks and
on hand and short-term deposits with a maturity of three months or less, which are subject to
an insignificant risk of changes in value.

For the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist
of cash and short-term deposits, as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts as they
are considered an integral part of the Group’s cash management.

**L.** **Equity**
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of
new shares are recognised in equity as a deduction, net of taxes.

Treasury stock is recorded in equity as a reduction in equity when acquired, with no result
being recorded in the consolidated statement of profit or loss for its sale or cancellation.
Income and expenditure arising from transactions with treasury stock are recorded directly in
equity as a reduction in reserves.

**M.** **Redundancy compensation**
Redundancy compensation is paid to employees as a result of a decision by the Group to
terminate their employment contracts prior to the normal retirement age, or if the employee
agrees to retire voluntarily in exchange for such provisions. The Group recognises these
provisions when a proven commitment has been agreed for the termination of the
employment of workers, in accordance with a detailed, formal plan, with no possible
withdrawal, or an agreement has been reached to provide redundancy compensation as a
result of an offer made in order to encourage voluntary redundancies. Those provisions which
are not payable within twelve months of the date of the balance sheet are discounted at their
current value.

**N.** **Provisions**

_General_
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a
result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits
will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of
the obligation. When the Group expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for
example, under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset, but
only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense relating to a provision is
presented in the statement of comprehensive income net of any reimbursement.

If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current
pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When discounting
is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.

_Contingent liabilities recognised in a business combination_
A contingent liability recognised in a business combination is initially measured at its fair value.
Subsequently, it is measured at the higher of the amount that would be recognised in
accordance with the requirements for provisions above or the amount initially recognised less

F-215


-----

(when appropriate) cumulative amortisation recognised in accordance with the requirements
for revenue recognition.

_Provisions required under IFRIC 12_
These provisions relates to the provisions associated with future work, essentially in concessions
accounted for using the intangible asset, that the Group’s concession operators are required to
carry out as a result of the use of the infrastructure in order to maintain and restore it.

These provisions are recognised on the basis of the best estimate of future disbursements
required to carry out the next cycle of work on the infrastructure, with the provisions being
systematically recognised during each cycle with a charge to the consolidated statement of
profit or loss on the basis of the usage of the infrastructure (with an average duration at each
of the concessions of between seven and ten years) until the work is actually carried out. These
future disbursements are estimated on the basis of technical studies, the quantification of
which is subject, inter alia, to the situation of the infrastructure when the work is performed
and to fluctuations in construction service price indexes. Consequently, the annual cash
outflows associated with these provisions vary according to the duration of each work cycle.

**O.** **Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting**

_Initial recognition and subsequent measurement_
The Group uses derivative financial instruments, such as forward currency contracts, interest
rate swaps and forward commodity contracts, to hedge its foreign currency risks, interest rate
risks and commodity price risks, respectively. Such derivative financial instruments are initially
recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are
subsequently remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair
value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative.

Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives are taken directly to
profit or loss, except for the effective portion of cash flow hedges, which is recognised in OCI
and later reclassified to profit or loss when the hedge item affects profit or loss.

For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as:

- Fair value hedges when hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised
asset or liability or an unrecognised firm commitment.

- Cash flow hedges when hedging the exposure to variability in cash flows that is either
attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly
probable forecast transaction or the foreign currency risk in an unrecognised firm
commitment.

- Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation.

At the inception of a hedge relationship, the Group formally designates and documents the
hedge relationship to which it wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management
objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. The documentation includes identification of
the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged
and how the entity will assess the effectiveness of changes in the hedging instrument’s fair
value in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item’s fair value or cash flows
attributable to the hedged risk. Such hedges are expected to be highly effective in achieving
offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows and are assessed on an ongoing basis to
determine that they actually have been highly effective throughout the financial reporting
periods for which they were designated.

F-216


-----

Hedges that meet the strict criteria for hedge accounting are accounted for, as described
below:

_Cash flow hedges_
The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in OCI in the
cash flow hedge reserve, while any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the
statement of comprehensive income.

Amounts recognised as OCI are transferred to profit or loss when the hedged transaction
affects profit or loss, such as when the hedged financial income or financial expense is
recognised or when a forecasted transaction occurs. When the hedged item is the cost of a
non-financial asset or non-financial liability, the amounts recognised as OCI are transferred to
the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability.

If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or
rollover (as part of the hedging strategy), or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, or when
the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss
previously recognised in OCI remains separately in equity until the forecast transaction occurs
or the foreign currency firm commitment is met.

**P.** **Taxes**

_Corporate income tax_
Corporate income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be
recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute
the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date in the
countries where the Group operates and generates taxable income.

Current income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity.
Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations
in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions
where appropriate.

_Deferred tax_
Deferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences between the tax
bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes at the
reporting date.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except:

- When the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or
liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the
transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss

- In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries,
associates and interests in joint arrangements, when the timing of the reversal of the
temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences
will not reverse in the foreseeable future

Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be
available against which the deductible temporary differences, the carried forward unused tax
credits or the unused tax losses can be utilised.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to
the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow
all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are
re-assessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become
probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.

F-217


-----

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in
the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws)
that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

Deferred taxes related to items not recognised in profit or loss are recorded in OCI or directly
in equity.

Tax benefits acquired as part of a business combination, but not satisfying the criteria for
separate recognition at that date, are recognised subsequently if new information about facts
and circumstances change. The adjustment is either treated as a reduction in goodwill (as long
as it does not exceed goodwill) if it was incurred during the measurement period or recognised
in profit or loss.

The Group offsets deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities if and only if it has a legally
enforceable right to set off current tax assets and current tax liabilities and the deferred tax
assets and deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority
on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities which intend either to settle
current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities
simultaneously, in each future period in which significant amounts of deferred tax liabilities or
assets are expected to be settled or recovered.

_Value Added Tax (VAT)_
Expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of VAT, except:

- When the VAT incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the
taxation authority, in which case, the VAT is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of
the asset or as part of the expense item, as applicable.

- When receivables and payables are stated with the amount of VAT included

The net amount of VAT recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as
part of receivables or payables in the consolidated statement of financial position.

**Q.** **Revenue recognition**
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of
goods and services in the ordinary course of activities. The revenue recognized by the Group is
measured at the transaction price of the consideration received or receivable to which the
Group is entitled to, excluding taxes or duties and after eliminating sales within the Group.

Revenue is recognized at a point in time or over time from sales when control has been
transferred and there is no unfulfilled performance obligation that could affect the acceptance
by the customer.

Where the contracts include multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated
to each performance obligation based on the stand-alone selling prices. Where these are not
directly observable, they are estimated based on the expected cost plus margin.

The Group does not expect to have any contracts where the period between the transfer of
the promised goods or services to the customer and payment by the customer exceeds one
year. As a consequence, the Group does not adjust any of the transaction prices for the time
value of money.

The Group has concluded that it is the principal in all of its revenue arrangements since it is
the primary obligor in all the revenue arrangements, has pricing latitude, and is also exposed
to inventory and credit risks.

F-218


-----

**a)** **Revenue by business line:**
a.1) Off-street and resident spaces
a.2) On-street
a.3) Selling of parking spaces
a.4) Management

**a.1) Off-street**
Off-street car park revenue is recognised when the hourly parking rate is paid and, in the
case of season ticket-holders, on an accrual basis. Mixed car parks (with off-street and
resident spaces) record income as follows: in the case of off-street spaces, in the manner
described in the preceding paragraph; and in case of resident spaces, the amount received
is recorded in the consolidated statement of profit and loss at the time of the transfer of
concession usage of the corresponding parking spaces. The cost of residential spaces is
recognised in inventories and are transcribed to the consolidated statement of profit and
loss on the date of the transfer of the concession of usage.

**a.2) On-street**
Income from the on-street car parks service (ORA) is mainly based on the amounts
regarding to the cost of providing the service plus a percentage, generally between 1%
and 3%, of the surplus between that cost and the cash collected. In some on-street car
parks contracts, income is obtained as a fixed percentage of the take, payable by the Local
Council. It is recognised in the accounts at the time the service is provided.

**a.3) Selling of parking spaces**
This business involves the construction of car parks whose spaces are sold directly to
customers during the time frame of the concession. The sales and costs are not recorded
until the parking space is delivered, which tends to coincide with the signature of the
contract or, exceptionally, with the public deed of sale.

**a.4) Management**
This business line regards to the management of contracts of a third party car park, mainly
located in airports, ports and shopping malls.

**R.** **Leases**
The determination of whether an arrangement is (or contains) a lease is based on the
substance of the arrangement at the inception of the lease. The arrangement is, or contains, a
lease if fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset (or assets)
and the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset (or assets), even if that asset is (or those
assets are) not explicitly specified in an arrangement.

_Group as a lessee_
A lease is classified at the inception date as a finance lease or an operating lease. A lease that
transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership to the Group is
classified as a finance lease.

Finance leases are capitalised at the commencement of the lease at the inception date fair
value of the leased property or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease liability
so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance
charges are recognised in finance costs in the statement of profit or loss.

A leased asset is depreciated over the useful life of the asset. However, if there is no
reasonable certainty that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term, the
asset is depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset and the lease
term.

F-219


-----

An operating lease is a lease other than a finance lease. Operating lease payments are
recognised as an operating expense in the statement of profit or loss on a straight-line basis
over the lease term.

_Group as a lessor_
Leases in which the Group does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of
ownership of an asset are classified as operating leases. Initial direct costs incurred in
negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased
asset and recognised over the lease term on the same basis as rental income. Contingent rents
are recognised as revenue in the period in which they are earned.

## 3 Significant accounting estimates and judgements

The preparation of the Group’s consolidated financial statements requires management to
make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues,
expenses, assets and liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures, and the disclosure of
contingent liabilities. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in
outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset or liability
affected in future periods. The Group based its assumptions and estimates on parameters
available when the consolidated financial statements were prepared. Existing circumstances and
assumptions about future developments, however, may change due to market changes or
circumstances arising beyond the control of the Group. Such changes are reflected in the
assumptions when they occur.

In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management has made the
following estimates and judgements, which have the most significant effect on the amounts
recognised in the consolidated financial statements:

**_Assessment of possible impairment losses on certain non-financial assets_**
The valuation of non-current assets other than financial assets requires the use of estimates to
determine their fair value for the purpose of evaluating any potential impairment, especially
for goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life. In order to establish this fair
value, the Company’s Board of Managers estimate the future cash flows expected from the
assets or the cash generating units to which they belong and apply an appropriate discount
rate in order to calculate the current value of those cash flows. Future cash flows depend on
whether budgets for the forthcoming five financial years are met, whereas the discount rates
depend on the interest rate and risk premium associated with each cash generating unit.

**_Taxes_**
Uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation of complex tax regulations, changes in tax
laws, and the amount and timing of future taxable income. Given the wide range of
international business relationships and the long-term nature and complexity of existing
contractual agreements, differences arising between the actual results and the assumptions
made, or future changes to such assumptions, could necessitate future adjustments to tax
estimation. The Group establishes provisions and recognises deferred taxes, based on
reasonable estimates, for possible consequences of audits by the tax authorities of the
respective countries in which it operates and estimated timing differences on reported assets
and liabilities (including for acquired businesses).

The amount of such provisions is based on various factors, such as experience of previous tax
audits and differing interpretations of tax regulations by the taxable entities and the
responsible tax authority. Such differences of interpretation may arise on a wide variety of
issues depending on the conditions prevailing in the respective domicile of the Group
companies.

F-220


-----

Deferred tax assets are recorded for all deductible temporary differences, negative tax bases
pending compensation and deductions pending application, where it is likely that the Group
will have future taxable income that allows the application of these assets. The Board of
Managers have to make significant estimates to establish the sum of deferred tax assets which
may be recorded, considering the amounts and dates on which future tax earnings will be
obtained and the reversal period of temporary taxable differences.

The Group has not carried forward losses on which no future taxable income is expected.

## 4 Information on consolidated statements of profit and loss

IFRS 8: ‘‘Operating segments’’ establishes that an operating segment is a component of a
company:

a) That carries out business operations by which it may obtain ordinary income and incur
expenses (including the ordinary income and the expense by transactions with other group
components).

b) Whose operating results are reviewed regularly by the maximum authority for making
decisions regarding the Groups operations, to decide about the resources that must be
assigned to the segment and evaluate its performance.

c) Separate financial information is available in relation to this.

The information of the Group’s consolidated statement of profit or loss by segments would be
the following:

**Segmentation by countries**
The Group has decided on segmentation by countries due to the significant differences each

prejudice to the fact that its criteria is correct and its claims will be successful. The total
amount paid by the Spanish tax group for this heading amounts to 13,455 thousand euros.

The other adjustments for the amount of 866 thousand Euros correspond mainly for the
regularization of the tax credits (655) regarding to the new fixed assets of Concha Parking S.A.

Independent audit report on the consolidated financial statements

To the Shareholders of EMPARK APARCAMIENTOS Y SERVICIOS, S.A.:

Report on the consolidated financial statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of EMPARK
APARCAMIENTOS Y SERVICIOS, S.A. (the parent company) and its subsidiaries (the Group),
which comprise consolidated statement of financial position at December 31, 2016, the
consolidated income statement, the global consolidated income statement, the consolidated
statement of changes in equity, the consolidated statement of cash flow, and the notes thereto
for the year then ended.

_Directors’ responsibility for the consolidated financial statements_
The directors of the parent company are responsible for the preparation of the accompanying
consolidated financial statements so that they give a true and fair view of the consolidated
equity and consolidated financial position and the consolidated results of EMPARK
APARCAMIENTOS Y SERVICIOS, S.A. and its subsidiaries, in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards, as adopted by the European Union, and other provisions in the
regulatory framework applicable to the Group in Spain, and for such internal control as they
determine is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

_Auditor’s responsibility_
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the accompanying consolidated financial
statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with prevailing audit
regulations in Spain. Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated
financial statements are free from material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and
disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the
auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the
consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk
assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the preparation of consolidated
financial statements by the directors of the parent company in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating
the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the
consolidated financial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
basis for our audit opinion.

_Opinion_
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view,
in all material respects, of the consolidated equity and consolidated financial position of
EMPARK APARCAMIENTOS Y SERVICIOS, S.A. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2016, and its
consolidated results and consolidated cash flow for the year then ended, in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards, as adopted by the EU, and other provisions in the
regulatory framework for financial information applicable in Spain.

Report on other legal and regulatory requirements
The accompanying consolidated 2016 management report contains such explanations as the
directors of the parent company consider appropriate concerning the situation of the Group,
the evolution of its business and other matters; however, it is not an integral part of the
consolidated financial statements. We have checked that the accounting information included
in the aforementioned consolidated management report agrees with the 2016 consolidated
financial statements. Our work as auditors is limited to verifying the consolidated management
report in accordance with the scope mentioned in this paragraph, and does not include the
review of information other than that obtained from the accounting records of EMPARK
APARCAMIENTOS Y SERVICIOS, S.A. and its subsidiaries.

The registered address is: Avenida del General Per ´on 36, Madrid, Spain.

Through these companies, the Group engages in the following lines of business, which are its

The main business of Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A. formerly Cintra
Aparcamientos, S.A. and prior to that Ferrovial Aparcamientos, S.A. and previously
Ferrevisa, S.A., is the construction and operation of car parks under public authority concession
arrangements. Said concessions stipulate that, to fulfil the concession time frames, the car
parks shall be returned to the granting entity in perfect conditions of use, without any
payment for provision of service for the Group. The Subsidiaries carry out the same activity as
the Controlling Company.

Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A., is the Parent Company of a group of 42 Subsidiaries
and 6 Associates; it has stakes in 5 JVs.

For the purpose of drawing up the consolidated annual report, the assumption is that a group
exists if the dominant company has one or more dependent organisations, over which the
dominant company exerts control either directly or indirectly.

Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A., the dominant company of the Group, was incorporated
in Madrid on 29 July 1986 as a public limited company. It is registered with the Company
Register of Madrid, on sheet M-53866, page 86, volume 14,090, and section 8 of the Companies
Book. The most recent adaptation and revision of its by-laws, based on the Company Register
of Madrid, is registered in volume 21,897, book 0 of section 8, page 222, sheet M-53866, and

## 2 Summary of the main accounting principles

 2.1 Reporting rules

The financial information listed in these annual reports has been drafted using the
International Financial Reporting Standards adopted by the European Union (IFRS-EU) and
becomes effective at the close of the financial year. Regarding the criteria used to apply these
regulations, it is worth mentioning that the Group has opted, in cases where the IFRS-EU
allows different alternative criteria, to value the tangible and intangible assets at historical
cost. The Consolidated Annual Report have been prepared from the perspective of modified
historical cost, with the exception of the case of derivative financial instruments, which have
been valued at reasonable value. These criteria are the same ones applied in 2015.

The Group applied the IFRS-EU for the first time in financial 2009 for drafting the consolidated
financial statements.

## 2.2 Accounting principles applied

The Consolidated Annual Report is submitted in euros and all of the values are rounded to
thousands of euros, unless indicated otherwise.

These annual accounts have been drawn up by the Directors of the Company to be submitted
for the approval of the General Meeting of Shareholders, it being considered that they will be
approved with no modification whatsoever.

## a) Regulations and interpretations approved by the European Union, applicable for the first time during this financial year.

The accounting policies used for preparing these consolidated annual reports are the same as
those applied to the consolidated annual report for the financial year ended 31 December
2015, as no modifications applicable for the first time during this period to regulations had an
effect on the Group.

## b) Standards and interpretations issued by the IASB but do not apply to this financial year

The Group has the intention to adopt any standards, interpretations and modifications to
standards issued by the IASB, the application of which is not mandatory in the European Union
on the date on which this consolidated annual report are drafted, if applicable to the group
when they come into force. Although the Group is currently analysing the impact, based on
the analysis carried out to date, the Group believes that their application will not have a
significant impact on its consolidated annual report.

## 2.3 Changes in shareholders

During 2016 the company purchased 7,042 treasury shares with a nominal value of 6.01 euros
each and subsequently it reduced its Share Capital by 42 thousands of euros through the
amortisation of these treasury shares. The company has paid 176 thousands of euros for the
shares which it has purchased, causing a reduction in voluntary reserves of 134 thousands of
euros.

-----

At the end of the 2016 financial year, the called capital stock is divided into 11,340,101 fully
called and paid up ordinary shares with a nominal value of 6.01 euros each, numbered in
sequence from 1 to 11,340,101.

At the end of the 2015 financial year, the called capital stock was divided into 11,347,143 fully
called and paid up ordinary shares with a nominal value of 6.01 euros each, numbered in
sequence from 1 to 11,347,143.

The share premium has the same restrictions and can be used for the same purposes as
voluntary reserves, including its conversion into share capital.

At 31 December 2016, the companies with stakes in the share capital are the following: (see

## 2.4 Comparison of the information

In accordance with current trading legislation, along with each item of the Consolidated
Financial Situation Statement, Consolidated Statement of Results, Consolidated Statement of
Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Statement of Changes to Net Equity and Consolidated
Cash Flows Statement, as well as figures corresponding to the financial year ending
31 December 2016, for comparative purposes the administrators submit the items
corresponding to the financial year ending 31 December 2015.

## 2.5 Working capital and going concern

As of 31 December 2016, the group presents working capital of 9,648 thousands of euros, and
15,134 thousands of euros in 2015.

The Group operates a centralised cash pooling system, by means of which Empark
Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A. handles cash requirements at the group level.

F-248


-----

Additionally, the group has lines of credit and other financial resources available to meet its
cash needs. (see note 21)

Therefore, the Board of Directors considers it appropriate to prepare the annual reports based
on the operating company principle, which means the realization of assets and liquidation of
liabilities for the amounts and according to how they are classified in the annual reports.

## 2.6 Accounting estimates and judgements

The information contained in these Consolidated Annual reports is the responsibility of the
Group’s Board of Directors. In the Consolidated Annual Report for the financial years ended in
2016 and 2015 have been carried out using estimates by the Group’s Board of Directors to
value some of the assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and commitments listed in them. These
estimates essentially refer to:

- Assessment of possible impairment losses on certain non-financial assets.

- Recovery of assets through deferred tax.

- Provisions for major repairs, replacements and fees.

- Evaluation of possible contingencies due to legal and tax risks.

Assessment of possible impairment losses on certain non-financial assets

The valuation of non-current assets other than financial assets requires the use of estimates to
determine their fair value for the purpose of evaluating any potential deterioration, especially
for goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life. In order to establish this fair
value, the Company Directors estimate the future cash flows expected from the assets or the
cash generating units to which they belong and apply an appropriate discount rate in order to
calculate the current value of those cash flows. Future cash flows depend on whether budgets
for the following five financial years are met, whereas discount rates depend on interest rates
and the risk premium associated with each cash generation unit. Note 6 provides details of
hypotheses used to calculate the value in use of cash generation units, including goodwill.

Recovery of assets through deferred taxes

Deferred tax assets are recorded for all temporary deductible differences, negative tax bases
pending compensation and deductions pending application for which it is probable that the
Company will have future taxable earnings allowing these assets to be applied. The Directors
have to make significant estimates to establish the sum of deferred tax assets which may be
registered, considering the amounts and dates on which future tax earnings will be obtained
and the reversal period of temporary taxable differences.

Provisions for major repairs, replacements and fees

Under non-current and current liabilities of the consolidated financial situation statement, the
Group has registered provisions totalling 50,757 thousands of euros (51,432 thousands of euros
at 31 December 2015). Making assumptions and estimates regarding the discount rate and the
expected costs to be incurred is an essential part of determining the value of these provisions.

These estimates were carried using the best available information as of 31 December 2016 and
2015 regarding the analysed facts. However, it is possible that events that may occur in the
future require modifying these estimates, which would be carried out in accordance with IAS 8
if applicable.

## 2.7 Resource management policies

The Group manages its investments after having carried out an in depth examination and
control of potentially attractive projects from the environmental, socio-labour, commercial,

F-249


-----

financial and economic perspectives, for the purpose of achieving sustainable and balanced
growth.

In carrying out this task, the Group’s shareholders aim to be in a desired position of balance
regarding expected investment profits and the risk level that can be assumed.

## 2.8 Consolidation policies

During financial years 2016 and 2015, the individual annual accounting closing date for all
companies included in the scope of consolidation was the same. Likewise, for the purpose of
uniformly presenting the different items that comprise these consolidated annual report,
uniform accounting criteria has been applied using the parent company’s accounting criteria as
a basis. The following methods have been applied to prepare the Consolidated Annual Report:

**a.** **Full consolidation method: All companies considered subsidiaries are fully consolidated. For**
these purposes subsidiaries are defined as companies in which Empark Aparcamientos y
Servicios, S.A. has effective control because it possesses more than 50% of voting rights directly
or indirectly by agreements with other shareholders. In assessing whether the Group controls
another organisation, consideration is given to the existence and impact of potential voting
rights which can currently be exercised or converted. Inclusion in the scope of consolidation of
the Group is carried out from the moment effective control of the subsidiary is formally
established. The value of shareholdings of minority shareholders in the financial year’s results
of dependant companies consolidated by overall integration are presented in the ‘‘Minority
Shareholders’’ chapters of the consolidated financial situation statement and ‘‘Results attributed
to Minority Shareholders’’ of the consolidated statement of results. (See note 20).

**b.** **Consolidation method by the equity method: Investment in associates are initially recorded**
at cost and their book value is increased or decreased to recognise the portion corresponding
to the investor in the financial year results obtained by the investee company after the date of
acquisition. In their result from the financial year, the investor recognises the portion of the
results of the investee company corresponding to them. Distributions received from the
investee company reduce the book value of the investment. It may be necessary to make
adjustments to include alterations to the stake in the investee company as a result of changes
in another global result of the investee company.

**c.** **Proportional integration method: Applied to those JVs in which the management of**
companies in which stakes are held is carried out jointly by the dominant group and by third
parties unrelated to the group. Assets and liabilities assigned to joint operations, or those
controlled in conjunction with other participants, are presented in the consolidated financial
situation statement, classified in accordance with their specific nature by existing share
percentage. Similarly, income and expenditure originating in joint businesses are presented in
the consolidated statement of results, in accordance with their specific nature, also by the
aforementioned share percentage.

**d.** **Balances and transactions with Group companies: Balances and transactions between**
Group companies are eliminated in the consolidation process.

**e.** **Conversion of financial statements into currency other than the Euro: The financial**
statements of subsidiaries and joint ventures, whose records are denominated in a currency
other than the Euro included in the consolidation process are translated to euros by applying
the year-end exchange rates to all its assets and liabilities except the balances of the shares
held in companies of the group and associated companies, which are converted using the rate
at the time they were included in the group. The shares held in companies of the group are
eliminated against the shareholder equity, except in the associated companies, which are
converted at the exchange rate at closing. The results are translated to euros at the average
exchange rate for the year. Differences arising during the translation process are recorded in
the shareholder equity section as ‘‘currency translation differences’’.

F-250


-----

**The consolidation has been carried out on the basis of the following criteria:**

- The companies in which Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A. has more than a 50% stake
in the registered capital and/or whose management is effectively controlled by it, were fully
consolidated.

- Temporary Joint Ventures are integrated into the individual financial statements using the
proportional integration method.

- Companies in which Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A. has a stake of between 20% and
50%, are integrated using the equity method.

The annual accounts of the foreign companies have been converted into euros on the basis of
the year-end exchange rate for the assets and liabilities and the year’s average exchange rate
for the profit and loss accounts. The equity corresponding to consolidated companies whose
currency is not the euro has been converted using historic exchange rates.

Third party shares in shareholders equity and results of companies consolidated using the
overall integration method are reflected under the ‘‘minority interest’’ items of the
consolidated financial situation statement and ‘‘Earnings attributed to minority interests’’ of the
consolidated statement of results, respectively. (See note 20).

a) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are those organisations, including special purpose entities, over which the Group
exerts or could exert control, directly or indirectly, this being understood as the power to direct
the financial and operating policies of a business in order to derive economic benefits from its
activities.

In assessing whether the Group controls another organisation, consideration is given to the
existence and impact of potential voting rights which can currently be exercised or converted.
Dependent companies are consolidated from the date when control is transferred to the
Group, and are excluded from the consolidation perimeter as soon as such control ceases.

The acquisition cost method is used in accounting for the acquisition of subsidiaries. The
acquisition cost method is used in accounting for the acquisition of dependent companies The
cost of acquisition is the fair value of the assets handed over, the asset instruments issued and
liabilities incurred or assumed on the date of exchange, the fair value of any additional
consideration dependent on future events (provided that this is probable and a reliable value
can be placed upon it), in addition to those costs directly attributable to the acquisition.

The assets, liabilities, revenue and expenditure of dependent companies are incorporated in the
consolidated annual accounts on the basis of the full consolidation method:

1. The book values of stakes in the capital stock of dependent companies are compensated
for, on the date of acquisition, through the proportional part which the aforementioned values
represent with regard to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities undertaken.

2. The difference between the book value of the holding in the dependent company and the
value attributable to said holding out of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities
undertaken is recognised, if positive, as consolidation goodwill. Under the exceptional
circumstance that the figure is negative, it is recognised as revenue for the financial year in the
consolidated income statement.

3. The assets and liabilities for group companies are included in the Consolidated financial
statement with the same values that are given in the respective balances of these companies,
except acquired assets and liabilities assumed on the date of acquisition which are included in
the consolidated balance based on their fair value on the date of acquisition, once the
amortisations and impairments arising from this date have been considered.

F-251


-----

4. The revenue and expenditure of Subsidiaries are included in the Consolidated Annual
Report.

5. Debits and credits between companies included within the consolidation group are
cancelled out, along with revenue and expenditure involved in transactions between such
companies, and results generated on the basis of such transactions, if not performed with third
parties.

b) Associated companies
Associated companies are organisations over which any of the companies included within the
consolidation group exerts substantial influence. Substantial influence is deemed to exist if the
Group has a stake in the company and can intervene in its financial and operating policy
decisions, without having actual control.

Investment in associates are initially recorded at cost and their book value is increased or
decreased to recognise the portion corresponding to the investor in the financial year results
obtained by the investee company after the date of acquisition. In their result from the
financial year, the investor recognises the portion of the results of the investee company
corresponding to them. Distributions received from the investee company reduce the book
value of the investment. It may be necessary to make adjustments to include alterations to the
stake in the investee company as a result of changes in another global result of the investee
company.

Any variations experienced during the financial year in the net equity following elimination of
the proportion based on results generated in transactions with Group companies, and not
involving third parties, increase or reduce, as applicable, the book value of the holding in
question to the corresponding proportion, following consideration of any amortisations and
impairments occurring since the method was applied for the first time.

Profits distributed by the Group included in the consolidated annual report under the equity
method reduce the book value of the holding.

A homogenisation of values and over time is applied to associated investments in the same
way as for subsidiaries.

c) Joint ventures (JVs)
The balance sheets and the profit and loss accounts of these companies have been consolidated
proportionally in the consolidated financial statement and in the consolidated income
statement as of 31 December 2016.

The group recognises the proportional part corresponding to it of assets controlled jointly and
liabilities incurred jointly in accordance with the percentage stake, along with assets attached
to joint operations which are under control and liabilities incurred as a result of joint business.

Similarly, the consolidated statement of results recognises the part corresponding to income
generated and expenses incurred by the joint business. Additionally, the costs incurred with
regard to the stake in the joint business are also recorded.

Non-realised results deriving from reciprocal transactions are eliminated in proportion to the
stake, in addition to the sums of reciprocal assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and cash flows.

- During 2016, the proportional integration method has been used to consolidate Ute
Torrellobeta, Ute Valls, Ute Palma, Ute Devas 1 and Ute Devas 2.

d) Joint businesses
The group’s stake in gains or losses subsequent to the acquisition of joint businesses is
recognised in the consolidated statement of results; its stake in transactions subsequent to the
acquisition is recognised in reserves. Accumulated transactions subsequent to the acquisition

F-252


-----

are adjusted against the book value of the investment. When the Group’s stake in the losses of
a joint business is equal to, or greater than the value of the stake therein, including unsecured
accounts receivable, the Group recognises losses up to the maximum amount that would
correspond to them based on their percentage stake in the equity deficit, minus tacit gains of
the assets of the company in question.

Any unrealised gains from transactions between the Group and its joint businesses are
eliminated as a function of the Group’s percentage stake in these. Any unrealised losses are
also eliminated, unless the transaction provides evidence of a loss due to impairment of the
asset being transferred. When necessary to ensure uniformity with policies adopted by the
group, the accounting policies of joint businesses are amended.

Those joint businesses with a 50% stake, but which maintain effective control of their
management because they directly or indirectly hold over 50% of voting rights due to the
existence of agreements with other shareholders, are accounted for using the overall
integration method.

## 2.9 Main valuation standards applied in preparing the consolidated financial situation statement and the consolidated statement of results.

 2.9.1 Intangible assets

Intangible fixed assets are initially valued at cost, either the acquisition price or production
cost. The cost of intangible fixed assets acquired by means of the combination of businesses is
stated as the fair value on the date of acquisition.

Following initial recognition, the intangible fixed assets are valued at their cost, less the
cumulative amortisation and, where applicable, the cumulative sum of recorded valuation
corrections for impairment.

a) Concessions
Concessions mainly includes the fees paid on certain concessions for the operation of car parks.

These public authority concessions are recognised as assets at cost minus the cumulative
amortisation and the cumulative amount of recognised valuation corrections for impairment.

Concessions also include access rights paid by means of a concession fee during the period of
the concession. In this case the concessions are included under assets at the current value of
the minimum agreed payments without taking contingent payments into consideration.

The concessions are amortised on a linear basis over the period of the concession.

b) Computer applications
Licences acquired for computer programs from third parties are capitalised on the basis of the
costs incurred in acquiring them and preparing the specific program for use.

The Company amortises its computer software on a linear basis, distributing the cost of the
assets over the estimated useful life of the same, which is three years.

The costs connected with the development or maintenance of computer programs are
recognised as an expense when they are incurred. The costs directly connected with the
production of individual, identifiable computer programs produced by the Group, provided
that it is considered probable that they will generate economic benefits greater than the costs
for more than one year, are recognised as intangible fixed assets. Direct costs include the cost
of the personnel developing the computer programs and an appropriate percentage of general
costs.

F-253


-----

## 2.9.2 Tangible fixed assets

Tangible asset elements are recognised at their cost of acquisition, with the addition of the
costs incurred up until their operational start-up, less the cumulative amortisation and the
cumulative sum of recognised losses.

The costs of the extension, modernisation or improvement of tangible fixed assets are
incorporated within the asset as an increase in its value only if they represent an increase in its
capacity, productivity or an extension to its useful life, and wherever it is possible to calculate
or estimate the book value of the elements cancelled from the inventory having been replaced.

The removal or disposal of any items is reflected in the accounts by eliminating the cost there
of and the corresponding cumulative amortisation.

The costs of major repairs to assets belonging to the group are activated and amortised during
the useful life thereof, whereas recurring maintenance costs are charged to the statement of
results during the financial year in which they are incurred.

The amortisation of tangible fixed assets, except for land, which is not amortised, is calculated
in accordance with the values of the updated cost, following the linear method based on the
estimated useful life, in accordance with the depreciation actually suffered through operation,
usage and enjoyment. The following are the estimated useful lives:

**Estimated**
**useful life**

Buildings and other constructions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 50
Machinery, installations and tools . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10
Furniture and fittings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10
Vehicles . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6
Other fixed assets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3

The car parks which are part of the property, plant and equipment (in the caption ‘‘Buildings’’)
are valued at the acquisition price or at the production cost, depreciated on a straight-line
basis over the life of the concession.

Where the book value of an asset is greater than its estimated recoverable value, its value is
reduced immediately down to the recoverable sum.

The income and expenses from selling tangible fixed assets are calculated by comparing the
amount obtained by the sale with the book value and are recorded in the income statement in
the ‘‘Impairment and result through disposal of fixed assets’’ caption.

The residual value and the useful life of the assets are reviewed, with adjustments made if
necessary at the close of each balance sheet.

At least at the close of the financial year, the need to perform valuation corrections based on
impairment in value is analysed

## 2.9.3 Impairment losses

In the case of goodwill, the Group carries out annual value impairment tests. In the case of
depreciable assets, at each accounting closure the Group assesses the existence of any loss in
value that forces it to reduce the carrying amount. If there is any indication of impairment the
recoverable value of the asset is calculated in order to identify the scope of the loss by
impairment in case its recoverable value is lower than its book value, and its effect is recorded
in the income statement. Impairment losses must be assessed for each individual asset. If this is
not possible, the impairment loss is determined for the smallest identifiable group of assets
that generates cash flows independent of flows from other assets (cash-generating units).

F-254


-----

The recoverable amount is the market value (arms length value less associated costs) or the
value in use, whichever is higher. The value in use is calculated from estimated future cash
flows, discounted at a rate that reflects the present market value, taking into account the
value of money and specific risks associated with the asset.

## 2.9.4 Interest costs

Financial expenses directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of fixed assets
requiring a period of time longer than one year in order to be fit for use are included in the
cost until such time as the asset is in operational condition.

## 2.9.5 Financial assets

**a)** **Loans and items receivable:**
Loans and items receivable are non-derivative financial assets with sums receivable which are
fixed or can be established and are not listed on an active market. These are included under
current assets, except those with a maturity date beyond twelve months from the date of the
consolidated financial statement, which are classified as non-current assets. Loans and items
receivable are included under ‘‘Corporate loans’’ and ‘‘Trade and other receivables’’ on the
consolidated balance sheet.

These are financial assets are initially valued at their fair value, and subsequently in accordance
with their amortised cost based on the effective rate of interest. Transaction costs directly
attributable to their acquisition are recognised in the statement of results. Quarterly value
adjustments for impairment are made if there is evidence that all amounts owed are not
collected. The amount of the value impairment loss is the difference between the book value
of the asset and the value of the estimated future cash flows, discounted at the effective rate
of interest at the time of initial recognition. Any value corrections, as well as their reversal, if
applicable, are recognised on the consolidated statement of results.

The recognition and reversal of valuation corrections through the impairment of client
accounts receivable have been included under ‘‘Provisions and losses of amounts payable that
cannot be collected’’ in the consolidated statement of results.

The sums charged to the impairment account are normally cancelled once there is no
expectation of more cash being recovered.

The maximum exposure to credit risk on the date of submission of the information is the fair
value of each of the aforementioned categories of accounts receivable. The Company does not
hold any guaranty as insurance.

**b)** **Investments in group, multi-group and associate companies:**
They are valued at their cost less, where applicable, the cumulative value of value impairment
corrections. However, where there is an investment made prior to the classification of a
company as a Group, Multi-group or Associated Company, the cost of the investment is
assumed to be its book value prior to such classification. Prior valuation adjustments entered
into the accounts directly under the net equity are maintained there until cancellation.

Investments in the assets of group and associated companies are included in the accounting
records, under both current assets and non-current.

The current assets include short-term investment in group and associated companies,
comprising corporate loans and other financial assets.

The non-current assets record the balance of long-term investments on group and associated
companies, comprising asset instruments. Asset instruments are broken down in the balances of
holdings in group companies, holdings in associated companies and share disbursements
pending and not called on.

F-255


-----

If there exists objective evidence that the book value is unrecoverable, the relevant valuation
correction is applied as the difference between the book value and the recoverable sum, the
latter understood as whichever is the greater of the fair value less the costs of sale and the
current value of the future cash flows derived from the investment.

## 2.9.6 Financial derivatives at fair value

Derivatives are initially recognised at market value on the contracting date. The subsequent
changes in market value are recorded as well on each balance closing date. The method of
identifying the profit and losses will depend on whether the instrument is classified as hedging
or not and if so, on the type of hedging. The different types of hedging designated by the
Group are the following:

i. Cash flow hedging: Its purpose is to hedge the exposure to highly probable future
transactions and variations in cash flow. The gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recorded
by the non efficient section of the consolidated statement of results, while the efficient part is
identified directly under net equity of the consolidated financial situation statement. The
amount deferred in net equity is not recognised in the consolidated statement of results until
the gains or losses of hedged transactions are registered in the results, or until the maturity
date of transactions. This recognition is carried out the same way as the results of the hedged
item.

In the case of derivatives that do not qualify as hedge items, changes in reasonable value are
recorded on the consolidated statement of results.

## 2.9.7 Business combinations and goodwill

Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition cost method which entails
recognising the fair value of the assets and liabilities identified in the acquired business.
Goodwill is the positive difference between the cost of an investment and the value of the
aforementioned assets and liabilities. Consolidated goodwill does not depreciate and is subject
to the impairment test. (see note 6)

Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units (CGU) with the aim of testing losses through
impairment. The allocation is made to those CGUs that are expected to benefit from the
business combination in which the goodwill arose.

At least annually, it is analysed if there are indications of impairment in value of the cash
generating units to which goodwill has been assigned, and if this is the case the possible
impairment in value is checked in accordance with Note 6.

During 2016 Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A, acquired 5,250 shares in Estacionamientos
Alh ´ondiga, S.A. which is 25% of the share capital, from Construcciones y Promociones
Balzola, S.A. for 1,250 thousands of euros. It also acquired 5,250 shares in Estacionamientos
Alh ´ondiga, S.A. which is 25% of the share capital, from Concesionaria Lagunak, S.L. for
1,425 thousands of euros. Consequently Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A is the sole
shareholder with 100% of the shares.

The difference arising between the fair value and book value of the acquired assets and
liabilities assumed which amount to 730 thousands of euros has been assigned in full to
intangible fixed assets.

## 2.9.8 Stock

Inventories are valued at cost or their net realizable value, whichever is lower. The cost of
inventories is determined using the weighted average cost method.

The cost of finished products and products in progress, which corresponds to developments in
progress and those completed, includes costs incurred in the construction of car parks intended
for assignment of usage.

Parking spaces held for sale and included in inventories are valued at the acquisition price or
production cost.

If the cost is greater than the market value, the relevant valuation corrections are applied, and
are recognised as an expense in the profit and loss account. If the circumstances leading to the
value correction cease to exist, the sum of the correction is subject to reversion and is
recognised as revenue in the consolidated income statement.

## 2.9.9 Cash and other equivalent liquid assets

Cash and other equivalent liquid assets include cash on hand, demand deposits at banks, and
short term, high liquid investments which initially have a maturity of three months or less and
are not subject to a significant risk of changes in value.

This section includes the short term restricted cash flow. This concept collects the investments
of the same nature and maturity affected by financing of specific infrastructure projects, whose
availability is restricted by financing contracts as guarantee to cover specific short term
obligations relative to interests or principle of the debt as well as for the future maintenance
of the infrastructure.

## 2.9.10 Net worth

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of
new shares are recognised in equity as a deduction, net of taxes. Acquisitions of controlling
group treasury stock for the consideration paid including attributable related costs are
deducted from equity. When these shares are sold or subsequently reissued, any amount
received net of costs is included in net equity.

The basic earning per share is calculated as the ratio between the net profits attributed to the
controlling company and the average weighted number of ordinary shares in circulation during
said period. In turn, the diluted profit by action is calculated as the quotient between the net
incomes attributed to the ordinary shareholders and the average weighted number of ordinary
shares in circulation during said period.

In the case of the Group’s consolidated annual accounts corresponding to financial years
ending 31 December 2016 and 2015, the basic earnings per share coincide with diluted
earnings per share.

## 2.9.11 Provisions for employees

a) Pension commitments:
Fixed provision pension plans
Pension plans which are not classified as fixed contribution plans are deemed as fixed provision
arrangements. In general, fixed provision plans establish the sum of the provision to be
received by the employee at the time of retirement, normally in accordance with one or more
factors, such as age, years of service and remuneration.

The Group recognises in its balance sheet a provision for fixed provision pension plans based
on the difference between the current value of the committed remunerations and the fair
value of any possible assets subject to commitments which are to be used to settle the
obligations, with any appropriate deduction being made in accordance with the sum of the
costs of past services not yet recognised.

If as a consequence of this prior difference an asset is recognised, its valuation cannot exceed
the current value of benefits that could revert to the Group as direct reimbursements or lesser
future contributions, adding, if applicable, the part pending assignation to results from the
cost of past services. Any adjustment which the Group may be required to make on the basis of
this limit in the valuation of the assets is attributed directly to the net equity, being recognised
as reserves.

The actual value of the obligation is determined through actuarial methods of calculation and
unbiased and compatible financial and actuarial assumptions.

Any variation in calculation of the current value of the committed remunerations or, as
applicable, the corresponding assets, at the date of close, as a result of actuarial profits and
losses, is recognised in the financial year during which it arises, recorded directly in the net
equity as reserves. For these purposes, profits and losses cover only variations arising through
changes in actuarial hypotheses or adjustments based on experience.

Costs of past services are recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement, except
in the case of revocable rights, in which case they are attributed to the consolidated income
statement on a linear basis over the remaining period up until the rights based on past services
become irrevocable. However, if an asset is derived, the revocable rights are attributed to the
income statement immediately, unless a reduction occurs in the current value of the provisions
which may be returned to the Group in the form of direct reimbursement or reduced future
contributions, in which case the excess above this reduction is attributed immediately to the
consolidated income statement.

F-258


-----

As of 31 December 2016, there are no people to whom Group companies have retirement
commitments.

b) Redundancy compensation:
Redundancy compensation is paid to employees as a result of a decision by the Group to
terminate their employment contracts prior to the normal retirement age, or if the employee
agrees to retire voluntarily in exchange for such provisions. The Group recognises these
provisions when a proven commitment has been agreed for the termination of the
employment of workers, in accordance with a detailed, formal plan, with no possible
withdrawal, or an agreement has been reached to provide redundancy compensation as a
result of an offer made in order to encourage voluntary redundancies. Those provisions which
are not payable within 12 months of the date of the balance sheet are discounted at their
current value.

## 2.9.12 Transactions among related parties

In general, operations among related parties are accounted for at the initial point at their fair
value. In any case, if the agreed price differs from the fair value, the difference is recorded in
accordance with the economic reality of the operation. The subsequent valuation is made in
accordance with the terms set forth in the applicable regulations.

## 2.9.13 Subsidies

A subsidy is considered not refundable when there is an individual concession agreement for
the subsidy, all the conditions for its concession have been met and there are no reasonable
doubts that payment will be collected.

The monetary type subsidies are valued using the fair value of the awarded amount.

## 2.9.14 Provisions and contingent liabilities

Provisions for contingencies and expenses are accounted for in accordance with the estimated
amount required to deal with probable or certain responsibilities arising from legal
proceedings in progress and for compensation and pending obligations of an undetermined
amount, guarantees or other similar sureties.

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation, either legal or implicit, as a
result of past events and it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle
the obligation and the amount can be estimated reliably.

Provisions are valued at the current value of the disbursements which are expected to be
required in order to settle the obligation, using a pre-tax rate which reflects the opinions of
the current market as to the current value of money and the specific risks of the obligation.
Adjustments in the provision based on any updates are recognised as a financial expense as
they accrue.

Provisions maturing within one year or less and with an insignificant financial impact are not
discounted.

Contingent liabilities are possible obligations arising as a result of past events, the
materialisation of which depends on whether or not one or more future events should occur,
outside the control of the Group.

Given the activities in which the Group is currently engaged it has no liabilities, expenses,
assets or provisions and contingencies of an environmental nature which could prove
significant with reference to its equity, its financial situation and its results. Hence, specific
breakdowns are not included in the report herein on the consolidated annual accounts with
regards information on environmental issues.

F-259


-----

Costs derived from the protection and improvements of the environment are attributed to the
consolidated results for the financial year in which they are incurred, irrespective of the point
when the monetary or financial flow derived from them occurs.

When such expenses involve the acquisition of fixed assets the purpose of which is to minimise
environmental impact and to protect and improve the environment, these are included in the
accounts as an increase in the value of fixed assets.

## 2.9.15 Financial liabilities

Debts and items payable
These liabilities are initially carried at the fair net value of the expenses incurred in the
transaction, subsequently recording these by their amortised cost according to the effective
interest method. The effective interest rate is the discount rate equal to the expected flow of
future payments foreseeable up until maturity of the liability. In the case that the effective
interest rate is initially considered different from the market interest, the liability is valued
taking into account the actual value of the future flows at that market rate in the case of
loans with set interest rates. If said interest rate is not fulfilled, the valuation of these is also
carried out at the aforementioned market interest rate.

In the event of a renegotiation of existing debts, it is considered that no substantial
modification has occurred to the financial liability if the lender of the new loan is the same as
that which granted the initial loan and the current value of the cash flows, including the
associated issuance and execution costs using the effective interest method, varies by no more
than 10% from the current value of the cash flows pending payment on the original liability,
calculated in accordance with this same method.

## 2.9.16 Corporation tax and deferred taxes

The Group has since 1 January 2005 paid taxes under the consolidated taxation system at
Cintra Concesiones de Infraestructuras de Transporte, S.A., as a result of the change in
ownership which occurred in 2004, following which the Dominant Company fell within the
aforementioned tax consolidation perimeter. The group previously paid taxes under the
consolidated taxation system as part of the Ferrovial, S.A. Group. During 2009, as a result of
the sale transaction referred, the Group left the aforementioned tax system, and on
31 December 2009 the company applied to pay taxes as a tax group, with effect from
1 January 2010. This group comprises the following companies:

- Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A.

- Dornier, S.A.U.

- Femet, S.A.

- Guadianapark, S.A.

- Balsol 2001, S.A.

- Empark Infraestructuras, S.A.

- Empark Aparcamientos Andaluc´ıa, S.L.

- Eospark Gestora de Participaciones, S.A.

- Maksu Espa ˜na, S.L.

- Car Parking, S.L.U.

- I Mas D Parking, S.L.U.

Corporate tax expense (income) is the amount that accrues on this account in the fiscal year
and includes both the expense (income) for current tax and deferred tax.

Both the expense (income) derived from current and from deferred taxes are recorded in the
consolidated income statement. However, the taxation effect connected with items directly
recorded in the consolidated net worth statement is recognised in the net worth.

F-260


-----

Assets or liabilities based on current tax are valued for the sums expected to be paid to or
recovered from the tax authorities, employing the regulations in force or approved and
pending publication at the date of close of the financial year.

Deferred taxes are calculated in accordance with the liability method, based on the temporary
differences arising between the taxable base sums of the assets and their book values.
However, they are not recognised when deferred taxes are the result of the initial recognition
of an asset or a liability in a transaction other than a combination of businesses which, at the
time of the transaction, does not affect either the book result or the calculation base for the
tax. Deferred tax is established by applying the regulations and taxation rates approved or
about to be approved at the date of the balance sheet, and which are expected to be applied
when the corresponding asset through deferred tax is realised or the deferred tax liability
settled.

Assets through deferred taxes are recognised to the extent that it is considered probable that
future taxable profits will be made which could be used to compensate for temporary
differences.

Deferred taxes on temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries, associates and
consortiums are recognised, except in cases where the Group can control the timing of
reversion of temporary differences and it is probable that they will not revert in foreseeable
future.

The term consolidated corporate income tax includes all taxes, national and foreign, related to
profits subject to tax. Consolidated corporation tax also includes other taxes such as taxes on
repatriated profits and any other levy taken as the basis for calculating the accounting result.

The corporation tax expense reflected in the consolidated financial statements is calculated by
aggregating the expense registered for each company that belongs to the consolidated group,
increased or decreased, as appropriate, by elimination of accounting consolidation adjustments
and by the differences arising between the taxable base sums of the assets and liabilities and
their book values in the Consolidated Annual Report (balance sheet method).

Deferred taxes are not recognised when the transaction has no effect on the book and/or fiscal
value of the assets or liabilities involved. In the case of business combinations, the
corresponding deferred taxes derived from the price assigning process and the fiscal
amortisation of the generated goodwill in each case is registered.

The assets and liabilities through deferred taxes are calculated at current taxation rates. At the
date of the consolidated income statement and which are foreseen to be applicable during the
period in which the asset is realised or the liability is settled. They are debited or credited to
the income statement except when they refer to items that are directly recorded as equity, in
which case they are accounted for as debit or credit to said accounts. By non distributed profit
of the subsidiaries, there is no liability through deferred taxes when the Group can control the
reversion of the temporary differences and it is not probable that these will be reverted in a
foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets and tax credits derived from negative tax bases are
recognised when it is probable that the Group may recover these in the future regardless of
the time in which they are recovered and always when the recovery is prior to the legal
reversion period. The assets and liabilities through deferred taxes are not deducted and are
classified as a non-current asset (liability) in the balance sheet. At each year-end, the
recognised Assets through deferred taxes are reviewed.

## 2.9.17 Conversion of foreign currency transactions

The annual accounts of companies in foreign currency have been converted to euros using the
closing exchange rate method in accordance with the following rates:

**31/12/2016** **31/12/2016** **31/12/2015** **31/12/2015**

**euro/Turkish lira . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** 3.3433 3.7072 3.0255 3.1765

## 2.9.18 Recognition of revenue

Revenue and expenses are attributed in accordance with the accrual principle, in other words
based on when the true value of the goods and services they represent becomes current,
irrespective of when the monetary or financial value arising from them is realised.

Revenue is recorded at the fair value of the consideration to be received and represents the
sums receivable for goods delivered and services provided within the ordinary course of the
Group’s activities minus returns, rebates, discounts and VAT.

The Group recognises revenue when the amount thereof can reliably be valued, it is probable
that future economic benefits will be received by the Group and specific conditions are met for
each of the activities, as detailed below. The amount of the revenue cannot be reliably assessed
until all contingencies connected with the sale have been resolved. The Group bases its
estimates on historical results, taking into account the type of customer, type of transaction
and the specific terms of each agreement.

**a)** **It is worth making the following distinctions within the car park business:**

a.1) Off-street and mixed parking
a.2) On-street parking (ORA)
a.3) Resident parking

**a.1) Off-street and mixed parking**
Off-street car park revenues are entered when the hourly parking rate is paid and, in the
case of season ticket-holders, on an accrual basis. Mixed car parks (with public and private
spaces) record revenues as follows: in the case of public spaces, in the manner described in
the preceding paragraph; and in case of private spaces, the amount received is recorded in
the income statement at the time of the transfer of concession usage of the corresponding
parking spaces.

The cost of residential spaces is recognised in inventories and are transcribed to the income
statement on the date of the transfer of the concession of usage.

**a.2) On-street parking (ORA)**
Revenue from the ORA on-street car parks meter service is mainly based on the sum
corresponding to the cost of providing the service plus a percentage, generally between
1% and 3%, of the surplus between that cost and the funds collected. In some ORA
on-street car parks contracts, revenue is obtained as a fixed percentage of the take, to be
paid by the Local Council. This is recorded in the accounts at the time when the service is
provided.

**a.3) Resident parking**
This business involves the construction of car parks whose spaces are sold directly to the
end customer during the time frame of the concession. The sales and costs are not

F-262


-----

recorded until the parking space is delivered, which tends to coincide with the signature of
the contract, or exceptionally, the public deed of sale.

## 2.9.19 Leases

a) When one of the Group’s companies is the lessee—Financial leasing
The Group leases certain tangible fixed assets. Leases of tangible fixed assets where the Group
substantially retains the risks and benefits derived from ownership are classified as financial
leases. Financial leases are capitalised at the commencement of the lease at the fair value of
the property leased, or the current value of the minimum payments agreed under the lease,
whichever is lower. To calculate the actual value, the implicit contract interest rate is used, and
if this cannot be determined, the Group interest rate for similar transactions.

Each lease payment is distributed between the liability and financial charges. The total
financial charge is distributed over the course of the lease and attributed to the consolidated
income statement of the financial year when it accrues, applying the effective interest rate
method. Contingent payments are recorded as a cost for the financial year when incurred. The
corresponding lease obligations, net of financial charges, are included in ‘‘Other items
payable’’. Fixed assets acquired under a financial lease system depreciate during their useful life
or the duration of the contract, whichever is lower.

b) When one of the Group’s companies is the lessee—Operational leasing
Leases where the lessor retains a significant art of the risks and benefits of ownership are
classified as operating leases. Payments under operating leases (net of any incentive received
from the lessor) are charged to the consolidated outcome statement of the financial year when
they accrue on a linear basis over the period of the lease.

c) When the group is the lessor
Where assets are the leased under a financial lease arrangement, the current value of lease
payments, discounted at the implicit interest rate of the contract, is recognised as an account
receivable. The difference between the gross amount to be received and the current value of
this sum for interest not accrued is attributed to the Consolidated Statement of profit or loss
of the financial year when said interest accrues, in accordance with the effective interest rate
method.

Where assets are leased under an operating lease arrangement, the asset is included in the
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position in accordance with its nature. Revenue derived
from the lease is recognised in a linear manner over the course of the lease period.

## 2.9.20 Redundancy compensation

In accordance with current legislation, the Company is obliged to pay compensation to
employees who, under certain circumstances, have their employment contracts terminated.
Redundancy compensation payments which can be reasonably quantified are entered as an
expense in the financial year in which a valid expectation created by the Company exists with
respect to the third parties affected.

## 3 Management of financial and capital risks

The Group’s activities are exposed to various financial risks: market risk (including exchange
rate risk, interest rate risk and price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.

Risk management is controlled by the Senior Economic and Financial Management of Empark
Aparcamientos y Servicios S.A., which identifies, evaluates and pages financial risks in
accordance with the policies approved by the Board of Directors. The Board provides policies
for overall risk management and for specific areas such as exchange rate risk, interest rate risk,

F-263


-----

liquidity risk, use of derivative and non-derivative instruments and the investment of surplus
liquidity.

The financial risks to which the Company is exposed include those derived from the guarantees
and bonds required in order for the company to undertake its activities.

During the 2016 and 2015 financial years, the Company had in place bank guarantees with
third parties and guarantee commitments with other Group companies in order to engage in
its business. (see note 38)

## Market risk: Exchange rate risk

Management has established an exchange rate risk management policy for foreign currencies
other than the operating currency. Forward contracts, negotiated by the finance department,
are used to manage exchange rate risks arising from future trade transactions and recognised
assets and liabilities. Exchange rate risk arises where future commercial transactions or
recognised assets or liabilities are quoted in a currency other than the organisation’s operating
currency.

The Group has no significant exchange rate risk, as most of its assets and liabilities, revenue
and expenses, are expressed in euros. Companies that, due to their origin (United Kingdom and
Turkey), use the currency of their country of origin, also express their assets, liabilities, revenue
and expenses in that currency.

## Market risk: Exchange rate risk from cash flows and fair value

As of 31 December 2016, if the interest rates on outside resources quoted in euros had been
50 basis points higher/lower, with all other variables remaining constant, the result after taxes
for the period would have been (1,078)/1,078 thousands of euros lower/higher, mainly as a
result of an increase/decrease in the cost of interest on variable-rate loans.

The Group carries out the corresponding interest rate hedges by contracting an IRS (Interest
Rate Swap). (see note 23)

Interest rate risk occurs as a result of possible losses caused by variations in the fair value or
future cash flows of a financial instrument as a result of changes in market interest rates. The
Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in interest rates mainly arises from variable interest
rate credits and loans.

Out of the 457,501 thousands of euros of long term debt in 2016 (463,971 of debt minus
6,470 thousands of euros of amortised cost), only 190,315 thousands of euros are influenced by
the Euribor. In 2015, the amount of long term debt held is 457,660 thousands of euros (465,984
of debt minus 8,324 thousands of euros of amortised cost), and the amount influenced by
interest rates is 189,094 thousands of euros.

Below can be found details of net non-current funding classified based on interest rate
structure:

**Thousands of euros** **2016** **2015**

**457,501** **457,660**

Variable interest rate funding is Euribor-linked.

The Company has no need to contract long term debt with the December 2013 bond issue

F-264


-----

**Credit risk**
Credit risk is handled by groups. Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, financial
derivative instruments and deposits held in banks and financial institutions, along with
wholesale and retail clients including pending accounts receivable and committed transactions.
With respect to banks and financial institutions, only financial institutions that are known to be
reputable and solvent are accepted.

Credit risk occurs as a result of the possible loss caused by a breach of contractual obligations
by the Company’s counterparts, in other words the possibility of not recovering financial assets
at the value accounted for and within the established deadlines.

Maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 December is as follows:

**2016** **2015**

Breakdowns are periodically prepared showing the age of each balance receivable, which serve
as a basis for managing their collection. Debt with an age in excess of 1 year is reviewed on an
annual basis and a monthly insolvency provision is allocated.

**Liquidity risk**
Prudent management of liquidity risk involves holding sufficient cash and transferable
securities, having access to finance through a sufficient sum of agreed credit facilities and
having the capacity to unwind market positions. Given the dynamic nature of underlying
businesses, the aim of the Group’s treasury department is to maintain funding availability by
ensuring that lines of credit are available.

Liquidity risk occurs as a result of the possibility that the Company may not have access to
liquid funds of a sufficient quantity and at an appropriate cost in order at all times to meet its
payment obligations.

Through the companies Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A. and Dornier, S.A.U., at all times
the group has guaranteed its liquidity requirements through lines of credit with financial
entities worth a total amount of 9,000 thousands of euros, as well as a revolving credit facility
with a limit of 30,000 thousands of euros. As of 31 December 2016, it only had the sum of
550 thousand in lines of credit, however it did not have any RCF.

**Capital management**
The Group manages capital such that a debt ratio that gives financial stability to the group is
maintained; it seeks investments with optimal profitability rates for the purpose of generating
greater solidity and profitability for the Group.

As can be seen on the balance sheet, most of the debt is long term. These ratios reflect the
fact that prudent criteria are used for capital management, as expected cash flows over coming
years, along with the group’s equity situation, will service the debt.

**Impairment tests**
The Group conducts an annual procedure to identify any possible deficit in the registered cost
with regard to the recoverable value of goodwill.

In the case of the goodwill of Empark Parking and Services, S.A., Dornier, SAU, Balsol 2001,
S.A., Car Parking, S.L.U. and Empark Portugal-Empreendimentos e Explora¸cao de
Parqueamentos, S.A. this procedure is performed by analysing the assets—the individual
parking facilities—available to the companies at the time of purchase and which gave rise to
the goodwill recognised.

The impairment is calculated by comparing the value of these assets with their fair value, the
latter understood as the value of the future cash flow discounts which it is estimated that the
assets will generate based on objective hypotheses, discounted at an estimated capital cost
based on a risk-free rate using the 30-year bond as a benchmark and the level of risk of the
asset, along with an estimated market premium.

A residual value is furthermore calculated, incorporating the renewal of the contract and
growth.

-----

The following assumptions have been assumed to determine the present value of future cash
flows from investments for the 2015 and 2016 years:

- It has been determined that the corresponding investment will generate cash flows with
terms up to maturity; this period is between 5 and 50 years, depending on the concession.

- The associated revenue and expenditure forecasts were performed in accordance with the
following general criteria:

  - In the case of revenue, in order to estimate price variations, consideration was given to
the estimated variation in the consumer price index (CPI) in each of the countries where
the investments are operational (2% in both Spain and Portugal), the appropriate price
review formulae as set forth in the concession contracts on the basis of the price
variation indices and/or any specific correction factors which may apply.

Ramp up during the first 2-5 years of the concession has been taken into account in the
case of new contracts, depending on the specific analysis of each contract; subsequently,
an evolution in revenue similar to previous revenue has been estimated.

  - In terms of expenditure, the evolution thereof was calculated on the basis of the
envisaged evolution of corresponding CPI rates (2% in both Spain and Portugal), as well
as on the planned evolution of the activity.

  - Consideration is also given to the cost of works to be performed in order to keep
infrastructure in perfect usage conditions, based on the best estimate available according
to the company’s experience, and taking into consideration the forecast evolution of the
business.

  - Consideration was given to the future costs and revenue associated with renewals of
contracts and also the investments required for these renewals on the basis of the
investments occurring in previous contracts.

Renewal rates used in different lines of business (off-street, ORA, management) have
been estimated between 75% and 85% based on actual rates obtained by the Group.

  - The forecast cash flows obtained on the basis of the projected revenue and expenditure,
in accordance with the aforementioned criteria, were updated at the discount rate
resulting from adding to the long-term cost of money the risk premium assigned by the
market to the country where the Group performs its operations, the risk premium
assigned by the market to each business (both based on a long-term vision), along with
the financial structure of the company or cash-generating unit in question. The discount
rate employed was 6.75%.

As a result of the impairment test performed, it has been revealed that the various
cash-generating units to which the various recorded sums of goodwill are assigned will serve to
recover the net value of each of the sums recorded by 31 December 2016, and there is
therefore no need to establish any form of impairment provision.

Similarly, sensitivity analyses have been performed on reasonably possible changes to the main
valuation variables (CPI, inflation, discount rate, renewals) and the recoverable value remain
above the net accounting value.

## 15 Reserves and results from previous years

- Non distributable Reserves

Companies are obliged to allocate at least 10 percent of the profits of each year to the
statutory reserve until it reaches an amount equal to 20 percent of the share capital. This
reserve cannot be distributed to the shareholders and may only be used to offset losses on the
profit and loss account, provided that sufficient other reserves are not available for this
purpose. Under certain conditions it may also be used to increase the capital stock.

The reserves for goodwill were made up in previous financial years in accordance with
section 4 of article 273 of the amended text of the Spanish Corporations Law (repealed with
effect from 1 January 2016) which established that it must contain at least five percent of the
goodwill total (note 6) which is in the balance sheet charged to the profits for the financial
year, or if not sufficient, charged to voluntary reserves, and it was unavailable whilst the
corresponding goodwill was recorded in the Company balance.

This reserve is not available and, pursuant to what is set forth in the single transitory provision
of Royal Decree 602/2016 dated 2 December from 1 January 2016, the sum of the same which
exceeds the goodwill recorded in the balance sheet must be reclassified as voluntary reserves
and will be available.

The ‘‘Reserves and results from previous financial years’’ item on the consolidated financial
situation statement at 31 December 2016 and 2015 is detailed below:

The group contracts derivative financial instruments (interest rate swaps) with different third
parties, mainly financial institutions with suitable credit ratings (‘‘investment grade’’) to cover
interest rate fluctuations of their bank loans. These derivatives meet the conditions to be
designated as accounting hedge instruments (cash flow hedges), so any changes to their fair
value are temporarily allocated to net equity. Valuation techniques with observable market
data have been used for their valuation. The most frequently applied evaluation techniques
include future price models, using calculations of the current value of expected cash flows. The
models incorporate different data, including credit rating and interest rate curves. Change in
credit risk have neither had a material effect on the efficacy of the hedge not on the valuation
of derivatives designated as such.

On 18 November 2011, Empark Aparcamientos Andaluc´ıa, S.L., took out a loan with La Caixa
amounting to 7,000 thousands of euros. This loan is hedged with the same entity for
6,300 thousands of euros. As of 31 December 2016 the notional figure was 4,925 thousands of
euros. Empark Aparcamientos Andaluc´ıa, S.L., pays a fixed rate of 2.83% for this swap.

As of 31 December 2016, the company Aparcamientos Guipuzcoanos, S.A. holds an interest rate
derivative to manage exposure to fluctuations in syndicated credit rates contracted at variable
rates. This contract fixes a range of interest payments and charges, depending on the current
market interest rate (Euribor). As of 31 December 2016 and 2015 the Company had recorded
the valuation of this product, net of the taxation effect, for a sum of 1,097 thousands of euros.

As of 31 December 2016 Concha Parking, S.A. holds an interest rate derivative to manage
exposure to fluctuations of the rates of its bank loans arranged at variable rates. These
contracts fix a range of interest payments and charges depending on the current market
interest rate (Euribor). As of 31 December 2016 and 2015 the Company had recorded the
valuation of this product, net of the taxation effect, for a sum of 2,214 thousands of euros.

The valuation of the derivatives owned by the Group as of 31 December 2016 and 2015 is
(5,260) thousands of euros and (4,594) thousands of euros respectively. (see note 19)

The Group classifies valuations at fair value using a hierarchy that reflects the relevance of the
variables employed in the valuations as per the following levels:

a) non-adjusted quoted prices on active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1).

F-300


-----

b) variables other than the quoted prices included in Level 1, which can be observed for the
asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices), or indirectly (that is, derived from prices)
(Level 2), and

c) variables, used for the asset or liability, that are not based on observable market data
(unobservable variables -Level 3).

The only Group assets or liabilities valued at fair value are these derivatives (interest swaps),
found in category b) of the previous breakdown (Level 2).

## 27 Tax situation

In accordance with current legislation, settlement of taxes cannot be considered definitive until
such time as the tax authorities have made their inspection, or the statutory period of
limitation (currently set at four years) has expired. The Company is subject to inspection for the
four last financial years for all applicable taxes, from 2012 to 2015 for Corporation Tax and
2013 to 2016 for other taxes. In the opinion of the Company Directors, along with their
taxation advisers, there exist no fiscal contingencies for significant sums which could arise, in
the event of inspection, from any possible differing interpretations of the taxation regulations
applicable to the transactions undertaken by the Company.

Law 27/2014, of 27 November, on Corporation Tax, amended the general taxation rate,
decreasing from the rate of 28% in 2015 to the current rate of 25%.

As for the Company’s financial risk management policy, this is based on the Group managing
its capital in order to guarantee that it will be in a position to continue operating as a
profitable business, while maximising shareholder return by striking an optimum balance
between debt and shareholders equity.

Below are set out the main risks to which the Group is exposed:

- Liquidity risk: The Group establishes its treasury needs as part of its general policy through
the use of two tools: Treasury budget with a 12-month horizon with monthly detail and
updates and treasury budgets with a 30-day horizon with daily updates and details. These
tools identify treasury needs in volume and time and make plans for new financing needs.

- Credit risk: The Group maintains its cash and cash equivalents in financial institutions with
high credit ratings. It should furthermore be mentioned that there is no significant
concentration of credit risk with third parties.

F-328


-----

- Interest rate risk: The interest rate risk of the Group arises basically from long-term
borrowings. The Group has contracted financial instruments that partially cover the risk of
possible interest rate hikes.

- Exchange rate risk: The Group has no significant exchange rate risk since the vast majority of
its assets and liabilities, income and expenses are denominated in euros.
