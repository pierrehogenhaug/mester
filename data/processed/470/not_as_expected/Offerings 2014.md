Empark Funding S.A., a société anonyme incorporated and existing under Luxembourg law and registered with the Luxembourg Register of Commerce
and Companies under the number B 182.119 (the “Issuer”) has offered (the “Offering”) €235,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 6.75% senior

“Floating Rate Notes” and, together with the Fixed Rate Notes, the “Notes”). Interest on the Fixed Rate Notes will be paid semi-annually in arrears on
June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on June 15, 2014. The Fixed Rate Notes will mature on December 15, 2019. The Floating Rate

thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, plus the applicable “make whole” premium, as described herein. Prior to
December 15, 2016, the Issuer may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the Fixed Rate Notes with the net proceeds from certain
equity offerings at the applicable redemption price set forth in this offering memorandum. At any time on and after December 15, 2016, the Issuer will be

less than all, of the Notes upon the occurrence of certain changes in applicable tax law. Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of
control, the Issuer may be required to make an offer to repurchase all the Notes at a redemption price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof,
plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any.

The Notes will be the Issuer’s senior secured obligations and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed (the “Note Guarantees” and each, a “Note
_Guarantee”) on a senior secured basis by Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios S.A. (“Empark” or the “Parent Guarantor”) and certain of its direct and_
indirect subsidiaries named herein (each, a “Subsidiary Guarantor” and, together with the Parent Guarantor, the “Guarantors”).

The Notes will be initially secured by first ranking security interests over substantially the same assets that secure the Revolving Credit Facility (as
defined herein), subject to the operation of certain security principles further described herein (the “Collateral”). See “Summary—The Offering—
_Collateral”. The Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging obligations will be secured on a “super priority” basis and in the event of enforcement of_
the Collateral, the holders of the Notes will receive proceeds from the Collateral only after the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility and
counterparties to certain hedging obligations have been repaid in full. See “Description of the Notes—Security”.

The security interests and the Note Guarantees, as well as certain claims against the Issuer and the Guarantors, will be subject to significant
contractual and legal limitations. In particular, the Note Guarantees of Empark Portugal—Empreendimentos e Exploração de Parqueamentos, S.A.
(“Emparque”) and Esli-Parques de Estacionamento, S.A. will be limited to a maximum amount of €29.97 million and €25.32 million, respectively, and the
security interest over the issued and outstanding shares of Emparque (following the conversion of the shares to bearer form) will be limited to a
maximum amount of €40.00 million with respect to the Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility. Furthermore, the security interests and the Note
Guarantees may be released under certain circumstances.

This offering memorandum includes information on the terms of the Notes and the Note Guarantees, including redemption and repurchase prices,
security, covenants and transfer restrictions. For a detailed description of the Notes, see “Description of the Notes”.

There is currently no public market for the Notes. Application will be made for the Notes to be listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange and admitted to trading on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange’s Euro MTF market. The Euro MTF market is not a regulated market pursuant to
the provisions of Directive 2004/39/EC. There can be no assurance that the Notes will be, or will remain, listed and admitted to trading on the Euro MTF
market.

The Notes will be issued in the form of one or more global notes in registered form. See “Book-entry; Delivery and Form”. We expect that the Notes will
be delivered in book-entry form through the facilities of Euroclear Bank SA/NV (“Euroclear”) and Clearstream Banking, société anonyme (“Clearstream”)

# Notice to Certain European Investors

**European Economic Area**

This offering memorandum is not a prospectus and is being distributed to a limited number of recipients for the
sole purpose of assisting such recipients in determining whether to proceed with a further investigation of the
issue of the Notes. This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that all offers of Notes will be
made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Directive, as amended, as implemented in member states
of the European Economic Area (“EEA”), from the requirement to produce a prospectus for offers of the Notes.
Accordingly, any person making or intending to make any offer within the EEA of the Notes which are the subject
of the Offering contemplated in this offering memorandum must only do so in circumstances in which no
obligation arises for the Issuer, any of the Guarantors or any of the Initial Purchasers to produce a prospectus for
such offer. None of the Issuer, the Guarantors or any Initial Purchaser has authorized, nor do they authorize, the
making of any offer of the Notes through any financial intermediary, other than offers made by the Initial
Purchasers, which constitute the final placement of the Notes contemplated in this offering memorandum. The
expression “Prospectus Directive” means Directive 2003/71/EC (as amended) of the European Parliament and of
the Council of November 4, 2003 on the prospectus to be published when securities are offered to the public or
admitted to trading and amending Directive 2001/34/EC (including the 2010 PD Amending Directive, in the case
of Early Implementing Member States), and includes any relevant implementing measure in the Relevant Member
State (as defined below). The expression “2010 PD Amending Directive” means Directive 2010/73/EU of the
European Parliament and of the Council of November 24, 2010 amending Directives 2003/71/EC on the
prospectus to be published when securities are offered to the public or admitted to trading and 2004/109/EC on
the harmonization of transparency requirements in relation to information about issuers whose securities are
admitted to trading on a regulated market.

In relation to each Member State of the EEA which has implemented the Prospectus Directive (each, a “Relevant
_Member State”), including each Relevant Member State that has implemented the 2010 PD Amending Directive_
(each an “Early Implementing Member State”), with effect from and including the date on which the Prospectus
Directive is implemented in that Relevant Member State (the “Relevant Implementation Date”), no offer has been


-----

made and no offer will be made of the Notes to the public in that Relevant Member State prior to the publication of
a prospectus in relation to the Notes that has been approved by the competent authority in that Relevant Member
State or, where appropriate, approved in another Relevant Member State and notified to the competent authority
in that Relevant Member State, all in accordance with the Prospectus Directive, except that, with effect from and
including the Relevant Implementation Date, an offer of the Notes may be made to the public in that Relevant
Member State at any time to:

- “qualified investors” as defined in the Prospectus Directive;

qualified investors as defined in the Prospectus Directive) in any Relevant Member State subject to obtaining
the prior consent of the Issuer and Initial Purchasers; or

- in any other circumstances falling within Article 3(2) of the Prospectus Directive,

provided that no such offer of Notes shall result in a requirement for the publication by the Issuer, any Guarantor
or any Initial Purchaser of a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Directive.

For the purposes of this provision, the expression an “offer of Notes to the public” in relation to any Notes in any
Relevant Member State means the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient information on the
terms of the offer and the Notes to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe for
the Notes, as such expression may be varied in the Relevant Member State by any measure implementing the
Prospectus Directive in that Relevant Member State.
Each subscriber for or purchaser of the Notes in the Offering located within a Relevant Member State will be
deemed to have represented, acknowledged and agreed that it is a “qualified investor” within the meaning of
Article 2(1)(e) of the Prospectus Directive. The Issuer, the Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers and others will rely
upon the truth and accuracy of the foregoing representation, acknowledgement and agreement. Notwithstanding
the above, a person who is not a qualified investor and who has notified the Initial Purchasers of such fact in
writing may, with the consent of the Initial Purchasers, be permitted to subscribe for or purchase the Notes in the
Offering.

This offering memorandum includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the securities laws of
certain applicable jurisdictions. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, all statements
other than statements of historical facts contained in this offering memorandum, including, without limitation,
those regarding our intentions, beliefs or current expectations concerning, among other things, our future financial
condition and performance, results of operations and liquidity; our strategy, plans, objectives, prospects, growth,
goals and targets; future developments in the markets in which we participate or are seeking to participate; and
anticipated regulatory changes in the industry in which we operate. These forward-looking statements can be

“could”, “estimate”, “expect”, “forecast”, “guidance”, “intend”, “may”, “plan”, “project”, “should”, “will” or “would” or,
in each case, their negative, or other variations or comparable terminology.

By their nature, forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors
because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. We caution
you that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that our actual financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows, and the development of the industry in which we operate, may
differ materially from (and be more negative than) those made in, or suggested by, the forward-looking statements
contained in this offering memorandum. In addition, even if our financial condition, results of operations and cash
flows, and the development of the industry in which we operate, are consistent with the forward-looking
statements contained in this offering memorandum, those results or developments may not be indicative of results
or developments in subsequent periods. Important risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause these
differences include, but are not limited to, those relating to:

- intense competition that can constrain our ability to win, renew and acquire parking concessions;

- the continuation or worsening of the European debt crisis and the recent economic crisis in Spain and Portugal;

- our concessions are granted for a limited period of time and are subject to termination on public interest
grounds or with respect to surface rights agreements under the terms and conditions contractually agreed as
well as under circumstances set forth under applicable private law;

- the tariff rates that we can charge our customers are governed by our concession agreements;

- financial difficulties of municipalities;

- changes in transportation and traffic patterns;

- we generate a substantial amount of revenues from a limited number of concessions and municipalities;

- changes in the applicable legal framework may impose significant costs on us;

- we may fail to successfully carry out construction work under our off-street concessions, and may not recover
our investment;

- we have minority partners for certain concessions and are minority partners with respect to certain of our other
businesses;

- our substantial leverage and debt services obligations;

- we are subject to restrictive debt covenants that may limit our ability to finance our future operations and capital
needs and to pursue business opportunities and activities;

- risks related to the Notes and our structure; and

- the other factors discussed in more detail under “Risk Factors”.

The foregoing factors and others described under “Risk Factors” should not be construed as exhaustive. Due to
such uncertainties and risks, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements,
which speak only as of the date hereof. We urge you to read this offering memorandum, including the sections
entitled “Risk Factors”, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
_Operations”, “Regulation” and “Business”, for a more complete discussion of the factors that could affect our_
future performance and the industry in which we operate.

Any forward-looking statements are only made as at the date of this offering memorandum and, except as
required by law or the rules and regulations of any stock exchange on which the Notes are listed, we undertake
no obligation, and do not intend, to publicly update or publicly revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a


-----

result of new information, future events or otherwise. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements
attributable to us or to persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary
statements referred to above and contained elsewhere in this offering memorandum, including those set forth

# Market and Industry Data

In this offering memorandum, we rely on and refer to information regarding our business and the market in which
we operate and compete. The market, economic and industry data and forecasts used in this offering
memorandum were obtained from governmental and other publicly available sources and independent industry
publications and reports. Industry publications and forecasts generally state that the information they contain has
been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but that the accuracy and completeness of such information is
not guaranteed. We have not independently verified such data and cannot guarantee its accuracy or
completeness.

In some cases, there may be no readily available external information (whether from trade associations,
government bodies or other organizations) to validate market-related analyses and estimates, requiring us to rely
on our own internally developed estimates regarding the industry in which we operate, our position in the industry,
our market share and the market shares of various industry participants based on our experience, our own
investigation of market conditions and our review of industry publications, including information made available to
the public by our competitors. Neither we nor the Initial Purchasers can assure you of the accuracy and
completeness of, and take no responsibility for, such data. Similarly, while we believe our internal estimates to be
reasonable, these estimates have not been verified by any independent sources and neither we nor the Initial
Purchasers can assure you as to their accuracy or the accuracy of the underlying assumptions used to estimate
such data. Our estimates involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various factors. See
“Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors”.

There are some discrepancies between the figures presented in the “Industry” section, which have been cited
based on figures from the Spanish DBK Report of March 2013 and the Portuguese DBK Report of March 2013,
(together, the “DBK Report”) and the figures presented elsewhere in the offering memorandum, which are based
on our own internal sources. For the purposes of the “Industry” section, we only refer to data from the DBK
Report.

# Presentation of Financial and Other Information

The Issuer was formed as a société anonyme under the laws of Luxembourg on November 28, 2013 for the
purposes of facilitating the Offering. The Issuer is wholly-owned by Empark and, prior to the date hereof, has not
engaged in any business other than in preparation for the Offering. Since the Issuer is a newly formed entity,
there are no financial statements available for it.
Unless otherwise indicated, the financial information presented in this offering memorandum is the historical
consolidated financial information of the Group. Empark is the Parent Guarantor of the Notes. The consolidated
financial statements of the Group are prepared on the basis of a calendar year, ending on December 31 of each
year.

This offering memorandum contains:

- the consolidated financial statements of the Group as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012, which
have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and audited by Ernst & Young, S.L., as set forth in their auditor’s
report included elsewhere herein (with comparative data for the year ended December 31, 2011);

- the consolidated financial statements of the Group as of and for the year ended December 31, 2011, which
have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and audited by Ernst & Young, S.L., as set forth in their auditor’s
report included elsewhere herein (with comparative data for the year ended December 31, 2010, which was
restated to reflect the impacts of new accounting standards (International Financial Reporting Standards
Interpretations Committee IFRIC 12 “Service Concession Arrangements”));

- the consolidated financial statements of the Group as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010, which
have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and audited by Ernst & Young, S.L., as set forth in their auditor’s
report included elsewhere herein (with comparative data for the year ended December 31, 2009);

- the consolidated financial statements of the Group as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2013,
which have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34; and

- the consolidated financial statements of the Group as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2012,
which have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34.

The financial information presented herein as of and for the twelve months ended September 30, 2013 is derived
from the Group’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2013
(included elsewhere in this offering memorandum) by adding together the results of operations for the year ended
December 31, 2012 and the results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 and then
subtracting the results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2012.

The financial information included in this offering memorandum includes measures which are not accounting
measures within the scope of IFRS, including:

- Adjusted Contribution Margin, which we define as Contribution Margin with respect to the year ended
December 31, 2012 as adjusted to eliminate (i) Contribution Margin generated by our Calle Sevilla parking
facility located in Madrid, which we expect to sell by January 2014, (ii) Contribution Margin generated by our
Cascais concession prior to its termination by the relevant municipality in 2011, (iii) net non-recurring expenses
incurred in 2012 and (iv) consolidation adjustments;

- Contribution Margin, which we define as (i) net turnover plus (ii) other operating income less (iii) variation in
stock of finished products and products in process less (iv) supplies less (v) other operating expenses and
expenses for personnel (in each case, excluding headquarter costs), for the relevant business line;

- Adjusted Revenue, which we define as net turnover plus other operating income less other non-recurrent
revenue less other “one off” or non-recurring gains and losses (including gains and losses realized from the
sale of parking spaces to local residents and gains and losses realized on the sale of parking facilities);

- EBITDA, which we define as consolidated results from ordinary operations excluding corporate income tax,
financial result, amortization of fixed assets and provisions and losses through unrecoverable receivables;

- Adjusted EBITDA for the Group, which we define as EBITDA adjusted for (i) non-recurring headquarter
operating expenses (including redundancy payments and other related personnel costs), (ii) non-recurring
business unit expenses and (iii) other “one off” or non-recurring gains and losses (including gains and losses
realized from the sale of parking spaces to local residents and gains and losses realized on the sale of parking
facilities);

- Adjusted EBITDA by business line, which we define as EBITDA for the relevant business line adjusted for (i)
reallocation of overhead costs and non-recurring headquarter operating expenses, (ii) non-recurring business
unit expenses (including redundancy payments and other related personnel costs) and (iii) other “one-off” or


-----

non-recurring gains and losses (including gains and losses realized from the sale of parking spaces to local
residents and gains and losses realized on the sale of parking facilities);

- EBITDA margin, which we define as EBITDA divided by the sum of net turnover and other operating income;

- Adjusted EBITDA margin, which we define as Adjusted EBITDA divided by Adjusted Revenue;

- Free Cash Flow, which we define as Adjusted EBITDA less maintenance and renewal capital expenditure,
changes in working capital, cash taxes and other non-cash items; and

- Weighted average remaining duration of our concessions, which we define as the average period of time
remaining on our concessions and contracts, weighted by the contribution each concession or contract has
made to our Contribution Margin for the year ended December 31, 2012.

See “Summary—Summary Financial, Operating and Other Information” and “Management’s Discussion and
_Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation” for further information about and the calculation of these_
non-IFRS financial measures.

You should exercise caution in comparing any of the above non-IFRS financial measures as reported by us to
corresponding measures of other companies. The EBITDA measures presented in this offering memorandum
differ from the definition of “Consolidated EBITDA” set forth under the caption “Description of the Notes—Certain
_Definitions”. By eliminating potential differences between periods or companies caused by factors such as_
depreciation and amortization methods, financing and capital structures and taxation positions or regimes, we
believe these non-IFRS financial measures can provide a useful additional basis for comparing the current
performance of the underlying operations being evaluated. For these reasons, we believe these non-IFRS
financial measures and similar measures are regularly used by the investment community as a means of
comparing companies in our industry.

Our management also uses the non-IFRS financial measures described above to assess our operating and
financial performance and to make decisions about allocating resources in our business. For example,
management monitors the Weighted average remaining duration for our concessions in order to evaluate future
cash flow variability and any associated risk.

None of the non-IFRS financial measures presented herein are a measurement of performance under IFRS and
they should not be considered in isolation or construed as a substitute for (a) operating profit or profit for the
period (as determined in accordance with IFRS) as a measure of our operating performance, (b) cash flow from
operating, investment and financing activities as a measure of our ability to meet our cash needs or (c) any other
measures of performance or liquidity.
The non-IFRS financial measures presented herein have limitations as analytical tools, including the following:

- they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures, contractual
commitments or working capital;

- they do not reflect the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or
principal payments on our debts;

- although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will
often need to be replaced in the future, and the non-IFRS financial measures do not reflect any cash
requirements that would be required for such replacements;

- some of the exceptional items that we eliminate in calculating the relevant non-IFRS financial measures reflect
cash payments that were made, or will in the future be made;

- other companies in our industry may calculate the non-IFRS financial measures presented herein differently
than we do, which limits their usefulness as a comparative measure; and

- they remove the results of impairments and disposals of fixed assets which may also occur in future periods.

Certain amounts and percentages included in this offering memorandum have been rounded. Accordingly, in
certain instances, the sum of the numbers in a column of a table may not exactly equal the total figure for that
column.

The financial information included in this offering memorandum is not intended to comply with the applicable
accounting requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and the related rules and regulations of the SEC which would
apply if the Notes were being registered with the SEC.

# Exchange Rate and Currency Information

Unless otherwise indicated, references in this offering memorandum to “U.S. dollars”, “dollars”, “U.S.$” or “$” are
to the lawful currency of the United States of America, and references to “euro” or “€” are to the lawful currency of
the European Union.

The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the high, low, average and period end Bloomberg
Composite Rate expressed as U.S. dollars per €1.00. The Bloomberg Composite Rate is a “best market”
calculation, in which, at any point in time, the bid rate is equal to the highest bid rate of all contributing bank
indications and the ask rate is set to the lowest ask rate offered by these banks. The Bloomberg Composite Rate
is a mid-value rate between the applied highest bid rate and the lowest ask rate. The rates may differ from the
actual rates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and other financial information
appearing in this offering memorandum. None of the Issuer, the Guarantors or the Initial Purchasers represent
that the U.S. dollar or euro amounts referred to below could be or could have been converted into euro at any
particular rate indicated or any other rate. Our inclusion of the exchange rates is not meant to suggest that the
euro amounts actually represent U.S. dollar amounts or that these amounts could have been converted into U.S.
dollars at any particular rate, if at all.

The average rate for a year means the average of the Bloomberg Composite Rates on the last business day of
each month during a year. The average rate for a month, or for any shorter period, means the average of the daily
Bloomberg Composite Rates during that month, or shorter period, as the case may be.

The Bloomberg Composite Rate of euro on December 10, 2013 was $1.3787 per €1.00.

**Overview**

We are the largest concessionaire and operator of parking infrastructure in the Iberian Peninsula, as measured by
number of parking spaces and revenues. We mainly operate underground car parks (“off-street”) and parking
areas on city streets (“on-street”) under concessions and surface rights agreements from public authorities. As of
September 30, 2013, our portfolio comprised over 310 concessions with more than 160 municipalities and other
contracts with customers such as AENA and ANA, under which we manage over 355,000 parking spaces in
Spain and Portugal. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2013, our net turnover was €177.6 million, our
Adjusted Revenue was €180.4 million and our Adjusted EBITDA was €62.4 million. Our operations in Spain
represented 76.1% of our net turnover, 76.2% of our Adjusted Revenue and 66.7% of our Adjusted EBITDA for
the twelve months ended September 30, 2013.

We have served the Iberian market since the late 1960s, when there were fewer competitors in the developing car
park sector. We believe this has given us a “first mover” advantage, whereby we have secured long-term
concessions and built a portfolio of prime parking locations in Spain and Portugal, including in city centers,
airports and other high density traffic areas, such as hospitals and business districts. Due to a variety of physical,
regulatory and other constraints, we believe that there is limited opportunity to develop alternative parking options
in many of these prime areas, allowing us to benefit from captive demand with limited competition.

We generate revenues under three business lines:

- _Off-street concessions. Our off-street concession business primarily comprises long-term concessions granted_
by municipalities to develop and operate underground or multi-story parking facilities, and represented 46.3%
of our Adjusted Revenue and 78.6% of Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended September 30, 2013.
Under these contracts, we are generally required to invest in the construction of a new parking facility (a “green
_field” concession) or make an upfront payment to the municipality for an existing parking facility (a “brown field”_
concession). We operate each parking facility on a long-term basis and generate our fees based on tariffs
charged to car park users, as set out in the relevant concession or surface rights agreement, which typically
increase each year in line with inflation. We generally retain all fees generated from operating the relevant
parking facility and are responsible for all expenses relating to operating and maintaining the parking facility
during the term of the concession. With respect to “brown field” concessions, we may pay an annual
concession fee to the municipality. In addition, we sell a limited number of parking spaces to local residents as
an ancillary activity in connection with the development of some parking facilities. As of September 30, 2013,
we had 172 off-street concession contracts with 76 municipalities. The Weighted average remaining duration of
our off-street concessions is approximately 28 years.

- _On-street concessions. Our on-street concession business comprises concessions granted by municipalities to_
manage meter-controlled on-street parking, and represented 41.1% of our Adjusted Revenue and 22.1% of
Adjusted EBITDA in the twelve months ended September 30, 2013. For these types of contracts, we typically
receive fixed fees that are inflation-indexed and which cover the yearly amortized amount of our initial
investment and operating costs. In a number of concessions, the contract also includes a variable incentive
element (which may be based on a percentage of the collected meter receipts, the number of parking spaces
or certain other quality indicators) to align the concessionaire’s objectives with optimizing revenue collection.
As of September 30, 2013, we had 139 on-street concession contracts with 125 municipalities. The Weighted
average remaining duration of our on-street concessions is approximately seven years. Since the beginning of
2010, we have renewed approximately 80% of our expiring on-street concessions for which we submitted bids.
In addition, we also won a number of our competitors’ contracts and overall our Adjusted EBITDA from onstreet concessions grew in each of 2010, 2011 and 2012.


-----

- _Off-street contract management. Our off-street contract management business involves contracts to manage_
parking facilities on behalf of public authorities, primarily airports, as well as a limited number of private entities.
Our off-street contract management business represented 12.6% of our Adjusted Revenue and had Adjusted
EBITDA of €(0.4) million in the twelve months ended September 30, 2013. Under these contracts, we operate
and manage parking facilities on behalf of third parties in exchange for a fixed fee. Although it is a relatively
small part of our overall business, our off-street contract management business line allows us to leverage our
expertise in managing car parks to improve our cash flow with minimal capital costs.

**Strengths**

We believe that we have several competitive advantages in the car park sector in Iberia, including our long-term
contract revenues, diversified business profile, assets with low demand risk and market leadership. As a result of
these strengths, together with the stable regulatory environment and favorable industry dynamics, our business
benefits from a high level of stability and recurring cash flows.

**Highly stable business characterized by low volatility and long term cash flow visibility**

For the twelve months ended September 30, 2013, 78.6% of our Adjusted EBITDA was generated by our offstreet concessions, which have a Weighted average remaining duration of approximately 28 years. Accordingly,
we benefit from a high level of recurring business and long-term visibility of cash flows, and we believe the longterm nature of our portfolio is matched by few other infrastructure companies in Spain and Portugal. In addition,
since the beginning of 2010, we have achieved a renewal rate of approximately 80% with respect to on-street
concessions for which we submitted bids when they came up for tender and we continue to win new off-street
management contracts, such as our new contract with AENA. In some instances, we have also successfully
renewed our on-street concessions despite our competitors submitting more competitively priced bids than ours,
which we believe is due to our superior technical competence and our wealth of industry experience.
Furthermore, in both Spain and Portugal, we have won approximately 63% of the tenders for new on-street
parking contracts and concessions, and approximately 36% of the expiring on-street parking contracts and
concessions that were previously operated by our competitors, in each case for which we submitted bids since
the beginning of 2010. As a result, since the beginning of 2010, we have increased our total number of
concessions and off-street management contracts and the total number of parking spaces we manage. Despite
the decrease in demand and volumes within our parking facilities that we have experienced during the recent
economic downturn, we have been able to mitigate some of the effects thereof through the inflation-indexed price
tariffs under the majority of our on-street concessions and off-street contract management agreements, as well as
growth in our concession portfolio and our implementation of cost management measures. The stability of our
business and the resilience of our Adjusted Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA during the economic downturn is
illustrated by the chart below.
**_Adjusted Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA since 2010_**

**Leading car park concessionaire in Spain and Portugal**

We are the leading car park concessionaire in Spain and Portugal by revenue and parking spaces. As of
September 30, 2013, we managed over 355,000 parking spaces in Spain and Portugal, and our market share in
the Spanish parking sector was more than twice that of our nearest competitor as measured by the number of
parking spaces. Our size and growth have allowed us to achieve significant economies of scale, and the scope of
our operations, combined with the various cost management measures we have implemented, have allowed us to


-----

protect our Adjusted EBITDA levels. For example, we have introduced a centralized system to control and
manage a substantial majority of our off-street parking facilities from a remote location, which has allowed us to
reduce personnel costs by reducing headcount, while still maintaining our high quality of services and customer
satisfaction levels. In addition, such measures have helped us to reduce our reliance on external service
providers by enabling us to reallocate personnel to perform certain functions previously performed by third-party
service providers. In addition, through our experienced management team and our long-standing reputation in the
industry, we have been able to develop and maintain important relationships with the various municipalities with
which we do business, thereby reducing our dependence on any single local authority or region. We believe the
upfront cost and difficulty in obtaining planning permission to build new high density car parks in city centers,
together with the favorable regulatory regime that applies to concession agreements in Spain and Portugal
discussed under “—Stable regulatory environment with downside protection” below, as well as the scale required
to operate car parks efficiently, present significant barriers to entry in the car parking industry.

**High degree of diversification**

Our business benefits from a portfolio which is highly diversified in terms of the following: number of contracts,
number of municipality clients and types of parking services we deliver. As of September 30, 2013, we had 172
off-street concessions, 139 on-street concessions and off-street management contracts with customers such as
AENA and ANA. Our off-street and on-street concessions were granted by more than 160 municipalities in the
Iberian Peninsula. We believe our limited reliance on any single contract is a significant factor in diversifying our
source of revenues and therefore reduces our cash flow volatility. We are also diversified through our three
business lines, each of which has different capital requirements, but with similar operational and managerial
requirements. We believe our diversified business portfolio differentiates us from other infrastructure companies,
which typically rely on a smaller number of larger contracts or concessions, with a greater concentration of risk.
**Strategically located assets with attractive concessions and relatively low demand risk**

We believe that our infrastructure portfolio is well invested, and given the attractive qualities of our portfolio,
combined with increased investor interest for infrastructure assets and the execution of recent infrastructure
transactions at favorable valuations, we may consider opportunistic disposals from time to time. For example, we
are currently in the process of selling our Calle Sevilla parking facility located in Madrid. Our on-street concession
and off-street contract management businesses have low demand risk because we are generally paid a fixed fee
for the services we provide, regardless of occupancy of the car park. Although our off-street concession business
is subject to demand risk and fluctuations in volumes, we believe the prime locations of our concessions attract
car park users that prefer to use our parking facilities, which, in many cases, are within close proximity to city
centers and conveniently located in high traffic areas. As a result, we believe that we enjoy a monopoly-like
position in the relevant local area with respect to a significant proportion of our parking facilities. Moreover, the
high density of city centers together with planning regulations make the approval process for “green field”
concessions difficult, effectively limiting the supply of parking spaces in a given area. Accordingly, the prime
positions of our car parks and the difficulty in building new car parks helps to reduce the demand risk in our offstreet concession business. Although we have experienced a decrease in demand and volumes within our
parking facilities as a result of the recent economic downturn in Iberia, our Adjusted Revenue and Adjusted
EBITDA have remained resilient.

**Stable regulatory environment with downside protection**

The regulatory framework governing off-street and on-street parking concessions in Spain and Portugal affords
certain protections to the concessionaire. We and other car park concessionaires that operate in the Iberian
Peninsula have historically benefitted from a “rebalancing” clause under the relevant concession legislation in
Spain and Portugal, which may also apply to Portuguese public surface rights agreements. Under certain
circumstances, a change in the balance of the economic terms and conditions of the concession that is adverse to
the concessionaire will trigger a right of the concessionaire to seek compensation or a “rebalancing” mechanism,
which typically results in either an extension of the concession period, an increase in tariffs payable by users, or
sometimes an increase in the number of parking spaces managed by the concessionaire, depending on the
circumstances. This regulatory environment has proven to be stable and predictable since the implementation of
the concession system more than 50 years ago and in the past, we have been successful in relying on such
protective legislation to seek additional compensation. Additionally, the municipalities granting concessions have
an interest in the success of public car parks since they are a source of income for the municipality and the
operation of car parks satisfies a public need.

**High cash flow conversion ratios with limited maintenance capital expenditure requirements**


-----

Our business model shares all the key features of infrastructure companies, such as long-term cash flow visibility,
resilient revenue generation, long-term concessions and a favorable and stable regulatory environment with
certain protections for the concessionaire in case of regulatory or administrative change. However, unlike some
other infrastructure companies (including those operating toll roads), our car parks, once operational, require
relatively low levels of maintenance capital expenditure. For example, our maintenance capital expenditure was
€2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, €2.3 million for the year ended December 2011 and
€2.0 million for the year ended December 2012. Our maintenance capital expenditure for the twelve months
ended September 30, 2013 was €1.7 million. Our infrastructure is well-invested as a result of the successful
completion of our large capital program in 2012, which involved the construction of eight large parking facilities
and a total capital expenditure for the period 2010 to 2012 of approximately €81.5 million. As a result, we believe
we are well positioned to benefit from returns on these investments without the need to make significant
maintenance capital expenditures with respect to these facilities. We do not expect to make any additional
significant expansionary capital expenditure in the near future. We benefit from attractive working capital
dynamics with low levels of credit risk with respect to our off-street concession business, since such revenues are
collected from users when they exit the car park. In addition, our credit risk with respect to our on-street
concessions is primarily with the municipalities rather than private third parties. As a result of all the above, we
have achieved stable Adjusted EBITDA margins, as well as significant cash flow conversion ratios (which we
define as Free Cash Flow divided by Adjusted EBITDA) of 90.5% and 89.3% for the year ended December 31,
2012 and the twelve months ended September 30, 2013, respectively.

**Strategy**

Our key strategies are the following:

**Maintain focus on growing revenue and improving EBITDA**

We will continue to implement measures designed to increase our revenues and thus enhance our EBITDA and
cash flows. Generally, under our concession agreements, we are subject to limitations with respect to the
maximum tariff that we can charge users of our parking facilities. As a result, we have the flexibility to structure
our pricing policy as we deem fit so long as we do not exceed the maximum tariffs set forth in the concession
agreement. Our pricing policy varies on a case by case basis, and we may use any or all of the following pricing
mechanics in order to maximize demand and volumes: (i) season tickets, whereby we can offer a range of
different products to fit our customers’ specific needs (for example, offering specific time slots on specific days or
for specific periods of time), which can help to increase volumes during those times of the day when rotation is
less intensive, as well as have a positive impact on our working capital as a result of receiving payments in
advance, (ii) different tariff structures, whereby tariffs will differ, for example, based on the time of day or the day
of the week, and (iii) long-dated sales, whereby we can expand our product and service offering by developing
special offers and promotions designed in partnership with third parties, such as travel agencies in connection
with holiday packages or special events. We may also seek to increase revenue and volumes within our off-street
parking facilities through increased deployment of car park signage and other forms of advertising in city centers
and other high traffic areas in which our car parks are located. In addition, we anticipate that revenues from our
large parking facilities opened in the past three years will increase over the coming years as they are currently in
the “ramp up” phase. Within our on-street concession business, we seek to continue improving our revenue
collection through the implementation of best practices in order to increase revenues collected for the relevant
municipality, which will thereby increase the level of variable incentive compensation we receive under such
concession. Moreover, we intend to continue to implement technological improvements to achieve greater
efficiency, which will allow us to more efficiently manage the parking areas covered by our on-street concessions
and increase the number of parking spaces covered per employee. As a result, we believe that we will be well
positioned to benefit from any sustained economic recovery in the Iberian Peninsula. We believe that
improvements in our volumes and revenues that may occur in connection with such economic recovery, together
with our various cost efficiency initiatives, will have a positive effect on our EBITDA.

**Maintain our disciplined and high operational efficiency**

We will continue to focus on managing our business in a cost-efficient manner by using the latest industry
technologies and improving customer service. We plan to continue to improve and extend the application of our
cost-effective practices, such as monthly contract-by-contract cost base reviews, the centralization of the daily
management of our off-street car parks from a remote location, our energy efficiency programs and our on-street
efficiency programs.
**Preserve and selectively expand our high quality portfolio of long-term concessions**


-----

We have a diversified portfolio of concessions and contracts in prime locations and will strive to maintain and
renew these concessions and contracts in order to generate stable cash flows. We believe our infrastructure is
well-invested following the completion of our capital program in 2012, which involved the construction of eight
large parking facilities and a total capital expenditure for the period 2010 to 2012 of approximately €81.5 million.
As a result, we intend to focus our efforts on renewing our portfolio of existing concessions and contracts and
organically expanding our operations by capturing new concessions and contracts. Due to our market leading
position, scale and expertise, we believe that we are well positioned to continue to grow our diversified portfolio by
renewing our existing contracts and concessions and capturing new contracts and concessions from both existing
customers seeking to award new concessions and from other organizations looking to outsource the management
of their parking facilities. Due to our scale, long-standing experience in this industry and established relationships
with municipalities, we are able to achieve significant synergies that also allow us to offer more competitive terms
than those offered by our competitors. We believe our position as the largest concessionaire of off-street and onstreet parking in the Iberian Peninsula, combined with our long-standing relationships with a diverse number of
local authorities and favorable industry dynamics, including high barriers to entry, will assist us in continuing to
implement this strategy.

**History and Ownership**

We commenced our operations in the Iberian Peninsula under the name Cintra Parking (the name of Empark
prior to its acquisition of Emparque) in Spain in the 1960s. Emparque commenced operations in Portugal in the
1970s.

Over the last five decades, our business has expanded through a combination of organic growth and a series of
mergers and acquisitions. The growth culminated in July 2009, when the Group was created following a series of
transactions. Our shareholders acquired Cintra Parking from the Spanish infrastructure company Cintra
Concesiones de Infraestructuras de Transporte, S.A. (currently Ferrovial, S.A.), after which Cintra Parking
acquired Emparque. The management team and the shareholders that have grown both businesses during the
last few decades form the core of today’s management team and shareholders, combining the best experience
and know how from both Cintra Parking and Emparque. For further information, see “Board of Directors and
_Senior Management” and “Major Shareholders”._

**The Issuer**

The Issuer was incorporated as a public limited liability company (société anonyme) on November 28, 2013 under
the name “Empark Funding S.A.” for an unlimited duration under the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and


-----

is registered with the Luxembourg Register of Commerce and Companies under number B 182.119. Its registered
office is located at 13-15 Avenue de la Liberté, L-1931 Luxembourg, Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. The Issuer
was formed for the purposes of facilitating the Offering and prior to the date hereof has not engaged in any
business other than in preparation for the Offering.

**Recent Developments**

**Trading update**

Despite the challenging macroeconomic environment in the Iberian Peninsula which has resulted in decreased
car park usage in recent years, we believe there are early indications of a slight recovery in our off-street
concession business for September and October 2013, as compared to the prior corresponding periods for 2012.
Based on the preliminary management information, we estimate that our off-street like-for-like revenues in Spain
and Portugal for September and October 2013, respectively, were higher than our off-street like-for-like revenues
in Spain and Portugal for September and October 2012, respectively. Accordingly, we believe that we are well
positioned to benefit from a sustained economic recovery in the Iberian Peninsula.

**_Emerging positive trend in off-street like-for-like revenues_**

We use like-for-like revenues to provide a comparison between all net turnover and other operating income
generated under our off-street concession business line during a specified month in the current year and all net
turnover and other operating income generated under our off-street concession business line during the same
month for the prior year, as adjusted to eliminate any new concessions and any concessions that expired or were
terminated during the periods being compared. Accordingly, if an off-street concession was in effect in
September 2012, but was no longer in effect in September 2013, the net turnover and other operating income
generated under that concession in September 2012 is not included for purposes of this comparison.

We have not yet finalized our financial or operating data for certain of the periods discussed above. Accordingly,
the above information is not intended to be a comprehensive statement of our financial or operating results for the
relevant period. The preliminary estimates above were prepared based on a number of assumptions and
estimates that are subject to inherent uncertainties and subject to change. Accordingly, our actual results for the
relevant period may vary from our preliminary estimates above, and such variations could be material. See
“Forward -Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” for a more complete discussion of certain of the factors that
could affect our future performance and results of operations.

**New contracts**

_On-street concessions: In October 2013, through a consortium in which we are the largest partner (holding a 35%_
interest), we won a tender to manage one of the two on-street parking zones into which Madrid is divided,


-----

consisting of over 83,250 parking spaces, for the next 12 years. The agreement came into effect on November 1,
2013. Prior to its expiration, the previous on-street concession agreement for Madrid (covering approximately
25,000 parking spaces) which this new contract has since replaced was our largest concession. Under the new
arrangement, we will receive an annual fixed fee from the municipality plus a variable fee based on certain quality
indicators and parking usage. While we expect the annual fees from this contract during the first three years will
be less than the annual fees we earned under the prior arrangement for on-street parking in Madrid, we expect
the average annual fees over the remainder of the contract will exceed the annual fees we earned under the prior
arrangement.

_Off-street contract management: In June 2013, we won a tender to manage 18 parking facilities on behalf of_
AENA, which owns and operates the majority of airports in Spain, including Madrid Barajas, Sevilla and Bilbao.
Under our previous arrangement with AENA, which this new arrangement has replaced, we managed 12 parking
facilities on their behalf. The new contract, which became effective on November 22, 2013, has a term of five
years and has resulted in more than 45,000 new parking spaces being added to our off-street contract
management business. Under this agreement, we will be paid a fixed fee, which will be subject to customary
adjustments.

**Calle Sevilla Parking Facility Sale**

In October 2013, we entered into negotiations with a third party in connection with the proposed sale of our
parking facility located on Calle Sevilla in Madrid for approximately €22.5 million (the “Calle Sevilla Parking
_Facility Sale”). As part of the proposed sale, we may have the right to subsequently manage the parking facility to_
be built there, once it becomes operational. During the twelve months ended September 30, 2013, this parking
facility generated approximately €2.7 million of EBITDA. The transaction remains subject to the negotiation and
execution of definitive transaction documentation, as well as the final approval of the Madrid municipality. Subject
to the foregoing, we expect that the sale will be completed by January 2014. We expect to use proceeds received
in connection with the Calle Sevilla Parking Facility Sale to repay borrowings expected to be drawn and
outstanding on the Issue Date under the Revolving Credit Facility in connection with the Refinancing, as
described under “Use of Proceeds”.

                        - be a senior obligation of the relevant Guarantor, secured by first-ranking
security interests in the Collateral as set forth below under “—Collateral”,
but under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement will receive proceeds
from enforcement of security over the Collateral only after any obligations
secured on a super priority basis, including creditors under the Revolving
Credit Facility and counterparties to certain hedging obligations, have
been paid in full, as described under “Description of the Notes—Security”;

                        - rank pari passu in right of payment to all existing and future obligations of

Guarantor that are secured by property or assets that do not secure that
Guarantor’s Note Guarantee, to the extent of the value of the property or
assets securing such obligations.

**Collateral** The Notes and the Note Guarantees will be secured by (i) a first-ranking security
interest over 99.9% of the issued and outstanding shares of Empark, (ii) a firstranking security interest over all the issued and outstanding shares of the Issuer,
Emparque (but only following the conversion of the shares thereof to bearer form),
Dornier, S.A., Femet, S.A., Estacionamientos Guipuzcoanos, S.L. and Balsol


-----

2001, S.A., (iii) a first-ranking security interest over 43.0% of the issued and
outstanding shares of EULSA, (iv) a first-ranking security interest over 24.5% of
the issued and outstanding shares of SMASSA, (v) a first-ranking security interest
over all the Issuer’s credit rights under the Funding Loan Agreements and the
Issuer Intercompany Loan Agreement, (vi) a first-ranking security interest over all
the credit rights under certain of the Guarantors’ Spanish off-street concessions
(which includes the rights to receive compensation, payments and owed amounts
under the concession agreements) and (vii) a first-ranking security interest over
certain bank accounts of the Issuer and the Spanish Guarantors (collectively, the
“Collateral”), as more specifically described under “Description of the Notes—
_Security”._

Empark and the Issuer have agreed to take all necessary actions to perfect the security interests in the Collateral
to the extent required under the relevant Security and Guarantee Documents executed on the Issue Date,
subject, in each case, to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (including the Agreed Security Principles) and
the requirements set forth in such Security and Guarantee Documents, as soon as practicable and in any event
substantially concurrently with any perfection of the security interests in the Collateral granted to secure the
obligations of the obligors under the Revolving Credit Facility.

The security interest over the issued and outstanding shares of Emparque will be
limited to a maximum amount of €40 million with respect to the Notes and the
Revolving Credit Facility. The Collateral will also be subject to other contractual
and legal limitations. See “Risks Relating to the Notes—The Security Agent may
_not be able to enforce a portion of the Collateral if certain actions are not taken to_
_register and perfect the security interests in the Collateral” and “Risks Relating to_
_the Notes—The Security Agent may be required to pay certain Portuguese stamp_
_taxes on behalf of the Noteholders in order to enforce the security interest over the_
_issued and outstanding shares of Emparque in Portugal”._

The Note Guarantees will be subject to release under certain circumstances. See
“Description of the Notes—Security—Release” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related
_to the Notes—There are circumstances other than the repayment or discharge of_
_the Notes under which the Collateral will be released automatically, without your_
_consent or the consent of the Trustee”._

**Intercreditor Agreement** The Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging obligations will also be secured
by first-ranking security interests in the Collateral. In addition, the Indenture will
permit certain other indebtedness to be secured by security interests in the
Collateral. The lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility and the holders of
certain hedging obligations will receive priority with respect to the distribution of the
proceeds of the Collateral in the event of an enforcement of the security interests
over the Collateral. The intercreditor relationships among the lenders under the
Revolving Credit Facility, the holders of the Notes and the holders of certain other
indebtedness (including hedging counterparties) will be governed by the
Intercreditor Agreement. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor
_Agreement”._

_Notes—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change of Control”._

**Covenants** The Indenture, among other things, will restrict the ability of the Parent Guarantor
and its restricted subsidiaries to:

                        - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred
stock;

                        - create or incur certain liens;

-----

with respect to the Notes or any Note Guarantee will be made free and clear of and
without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any present or future Taxes
unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required by law. If any
deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any such Taxes will at any time be
required to be made, the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will, subject to certain
exceptions, pay the additional amounts necessary so that the net amount received
by the holders of the relevant Notes after the deduction or withholding will equal
the respective amounts that would have been received in respect of such
payments in the absence of such withholding or deduction. See “Description of the
_Notes—Additional Amounts”._

**Denominations** The Notes will be issued in registered form and transferable in minimum
denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

exchange or registration rights. See “Notice to Investors”.

**No Prior Market** The Notes will be new securities for which there is currently no market. Although
the Initial Purchasers have informed the Issuer that they intend to make a market
in the Notes, they are not obligated to do so and may discontinue market-making
at any time without notice. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that a liquid
market for the Notes will develop or be maintained.

Stock Exchange and for the Notes to be listed on the Official List of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on the Euro MTF market.
There can be no assurance that the Notes will be, or will remain, so listed and

facilities and to pay the costs and expenses related to the foregoing. For further

# Summary Financial, Operating and Other Information

The following tables set forth summary historical consolidated financial, operating and other information of the
Group as of and for the periods indicated.

The summary historical consolidated financial information presented below for the Group (except for the footnotes
included below the tables and except as otherwise indicated) (1) as of and for the years ended December 31,
2010, 2011 and 2012, have been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements of the Group as of
and for each of the years ended December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012, as prepared in accordance with IFRS and
included elsewhere in this offering memorandum, and (2) as of and for the nine months ended September 30,
2012 and 2013, have been derived from the unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Group as of and
for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 and 2013, as prepared in accordance with IAS 34 and included
elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

The financial information presented as of and for the twelve months ended September 30, 2013 is derived from
the Group’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 (included
elsewhere in this offering memorandum) by adding together the results of operations for the year ended
December 31, 2012 and the results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 and then
subtracting the results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2012.

The summary historical consolidated financial information presented below includes certain non-IFRS measures
that we use to evaluate our operating and financial performance. These measures are not identified as accounting
measures under IFRS and therefore should not be considered as alternative measures to evaluate the
performance of the Group. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information”.

The summary unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information presented below has been adjusted to
reflect certain effects of the Refinancing on the financial position and net financial expenses of the Group as of
and for the twelve months ended September 30, 2013. The summary unaudited pro forma consolidated financial
information has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and does not purport to represent what the actual
consolidated financial position or net financial expenses of the Group would have been if the Refinancing had
occurred (i) on September 30, 2013 for the purposes of the calculation of net financial position and (ii) on
October 1, 2012 for the purposes of the calculation of net financial expenses, nor does such summary unaudited
_pro forma consolidated financial information purport to project the Group’s consolidated financial position and net_
financial expenses at any future date or for any future period. The summary unaudited pro forma consolidated
financial information presented below is based on available information and certain assumptions and estimates
that we believe are reasonable and may differ materially from the actual amounts.

The results of operations for the interim periods or prior years are not necessarily indicative of the results to be
expected for the full year or any future period or our financial condition at any future date. The following summary
historical consolidated financial, operating and other information should be read in conjunction with, and is
qualified in its entirety by reference to, the consolidated financial statements of the Group and the accompanying
notes included elsewhere in this offering memorandum, and should also be read together with the information set
forth under the headings “Presentation of Financial and Other Information”, “Use of Proceeds”, “Capitalization”,
“Selected Historical Consolidated Financial Information”, “Business” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
_of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”._

_This offering memorandum contains “forward-looking” statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual_
_results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might_
_cause such differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this offering memorandum. See_
_“Forward-Looking Statements”._

**Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry**

**We are subject to intense competition that can constrain our ability to win, renew and acquire parking**
**concessions, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations,**
**financial condition or prospects.**

Our principal business activity is the development and management of off-street parking concessions, primarily in
Spain and Portugal. We also manage on-street parking concessions for municipalities and, to a lesser extent,
operate our off-street contract management business, which involves contracts to manage parking lots on behalf
of public authorities, primarily airports and hospitals, and a limited number of private entities. The off-street and
on-street parking concession sector in Spain and Portugal is a highly competitive market, with a variety of
competitors ranging from small, local single-concession operators to large, regional, national and international
operators with a significant number of concessions. Some of these larger competitors are divisions of diversified
global corporations with substantial financial, management and other resources and capabilities.

In Spain and Portugal, concessions for parking facilities are generally awarded and renewed through competitive
tenders. In the bidding phase of a concession, a significant number of competing bidders may participate,
including large construction groups and financial investors. Generally, public tenders for off-street concessions
and off-street contract management are the most competitive, focusing primarily on economics. Public tenders for
on-street concessions tend to be less competitive, given the limited number of potential operators, and tend to
focus on the technical specifications of the concession and the demonstrated experience of the bidder. There also
may be significant competition to renew existing concessions. In addition, there is intense competition in Spain
and Portugal to acquire any concessions that may be available for sale by their existing holders or owners (or to
acquire concession operators). Certain competitors have greater financial resources and lower cost bases than
we have. Consequently, they may be able to bid more competitively than we can in public tenders for concessions
or may be able to offer more commercially favorable terms than us. As a result of such competition, we may not
be able to win new concessions or renewing existing concessions on commercially favorable terms, which are
consistent with those we have negotiated in the past, or at all. Our inability to successfully compete to win new
concessions or to retain existing concessions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition.

**Substantially all our of revenue and cash flow is generated from operations in Spain and Portugal, and**
**the continuation or worsening of the European “sovereign debt crisis” and the recent economic crisis in**
**Spain and Portugal could intensify the risks we face, which could materially adversely affect our**
**business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects.**

The continuing credit crisis in Europe has caused widespread concern about the ability of several European
governments to repay their debt. Conditions in Europe have resulted in increased volatility in global capital
markets, as well as lower consumer confidence in Spain and Portugal, which could continue for the foreseeable
future. Our operations are principally located in Europe, and in particular in Spain and Portugal, which for the
twelve months ended September 30, 2013 collectively accounted for 93.9% of our net turnover. Accordingly, our
financial performance is particularly affected by economic and financial conditions in Spain and Portugal, and our
results of operations may be further adversely affected if the difficult macroeconomic circumstances in Spain and
Portugal cause a sustained or significant fall in the demand for parking services. In Spain, the unemployment rate


-----

was reported to be 26.0% during the third quarter of 2013, and the gross domestic product contracted in 2012. In
Portugal, the unemployment rate was reported to be 15.6% during the third quarter of 2013 and the country has
agreed to receive financial assistance from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund. Despite
aggressive measures taken by governments and central banks, the economic recovery has been extremely slow.
A significant risk remains that these measures may not prevent the global or EU economies from falling back into
an even deeper and longer-lasting recession or fail to prevent a depression in Spain, Portugal and several other
countries. In these circumstances, many of the risks we face could intensify, which could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

The recent economic downturn has had, and will continue to have, a number of negative impacts on our business
in Spain and Portugal. Most significantly, the recent economic downturn has resulted in a reduction in automobile
travel of a discretionary nature, which has adversely impacted traffic levels in a number of locations where we
operate parking facilities. Additionally, the increase in fuel prices during the last two years also has led to less
automobile traffic and a further increase in fuel prices could exacerbate the decline in traffic. The reduced traffic
levels have resulted in decreased volumes at our parking facilities in those areas, which had a negative impact on
our revenues and margins.

The economic decline in Spain and Portugal, and the resulting need for these governments to close budgetary
gaps, has led to and may in the future lead to increases in VAT, corporate income tax or other taxes. Such
adverse tax consequences could result in a reduction of consumers’ available discretionary income, which could
negatively impact the number of people using automobiles and our parking facilities. See “—We are subject to
_changes in tax laws, tax rates and their application and interpretation in the markets in which we operate, and we_
_may be subject to significant claims related to future tax disputes and audits.”_

**Our concessions are granted for a limited period of time and are subject to termination by the granting**
**authority on public interest grounds under circumstances stipulated under public law or under the terms**
**and conditions contractually agreed to as well as under the circumstances set forth under applicable**
**private law which may also apply with respect to surface rights agreements.**

As of September 30, 2013, we had 172 off-street concessions and 139 on-street concessions granted by
municipalities. Our off-street parking concessions are typically long-term arrangements with a maximum term of
up to 50 years (although certain older contracts and surface rights agreements in Portugal, such as Camoes or
Alexandre Herculano, have longer terms), and our on-street parking concessions generally have a maximum term
of up to 25 years (or 20 years in Portugal). Moreover, while these concessions are generally long-term
arrangements, most of our concessions will be subject to a public tender process at the end of their term. The
loss of, or the renewal on less commercially favorable terms of, a significant number of our existing concessions,
or one or more of our largest concessions, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations,
financial condition or prospects.

In addition, under applicable public laws, the relevant awarding authorities in Spain and Portugal may terminate or
recover concessions prior to their expiration on public interest grounds, which
is subject to interpretation, or under certain other circumstances stipulated under applicable public law, subject to
judicial review of the grounds for termination. See “Regulation—Spain—Termination of the concession” and
“Regulation—Portugal—Termination of the Concession”. We have experienced one such termination in the past
five years. In 2011, the municipality in Cascais, Portugal (a seaside resort town of approximately 35,000
inhabitants) terminated our concession over a parking area in the municipality for public interest reasons. This
concession accounted for 0.5% and 0.4% of our net turnover and Adjusted EBITDA, respectively, in 2010. We
challenged the legality of the termination of the Cascais concession and initiated a claim for compensation for our
initial investment and loss of profits which resulted in the municipality paying us a settlement payment of
€0.8 million in 2012. We are also subject to the termination rights set forth in the terms and conditions in our
agreements as well as private law which may also apply with respect to our surface rights agreements.

Additionally, we have continued to operate certain of our concessions past the termination date before the
contract is renewed and awarded to us or awarded to another party. If we operate the concession beyond the
term of the contract, we may have limited recourse should the municipality terminate our services during such
periods.

Generally, in the event of early termination of the concession not due to fault of the concessionaire, the
concessionaire will be entitled to compensation from the municipality for the amount of the investments it has
made in carrying out the terms of the concession based on the degree to which the investments have been
amortized. We may also seek compensation provided by law or contract to cover our anticipated profits for the
remaining duration of the concession agreements if the awarding authority terminates the concession, although


-----

there can be no assurance that we will be successful. Additionally, the public authority has some discretion in
interpreting the terms of the concession, especially when determining whether we have complied with its terms. If
we are unsuccessful in seeking compensation from the municipality, our only recourse may be litigation, which
may involve additional expenses and an extended period of time to reach a resolution. Even if successful, due to
the recent economic crisis in Spain and Portugal, the public authorities may not have the resources available to
satisfy any claim by us for compensation for lost investment or profit on a timely basis.

Additionally, certain of our contract management agreements allow the counterparty to remove some parking
spaces from our management without compensation for public interest reasons. While this has not occurred in the
past, if the counterparty were to exercise such a clause, our rights to contest this action may be limited.

**Changes in transportation and traffic patterns could materially adversely affect demand at our facilities.**

A variety of factors are contributing to changes in the transportation industry that could have a negative impact on
our business, including changes in regulations and increased use of public transport by end customers, in
particular in connection with our off-street concessions where our EBITDA margins are most affected by changes
in demand, and to a lesser extent in connection with our on-street concessions. Changes in environmental and
traffic control regulations could reduce demand for, and volumes in, our off-street parking facilities that could
adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects. For example, some
municipalities may impose traffic congestion charges in urban areas, reduce the availability of on-street parking
spaces or promote the use of public transportation in lieu of automobiles. Governments may also increase the tax
levels on automobiles and petroleum for environmental reasons, which may reduce traffic. We may also be
materially adversely affected by temporary or permanent changes to traffic routes or road closures, which may
make it more difficult to access our parking facilities and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations, financial condition or prospects.

**In any particular period in which we experience a decrease in our net turnover, our operating expenses**
**may not decrease at the same rate, which could have a material adverse effect on our net cash flows,**
**margins and profits.**

Many of the expenses associated with operating concessions are relatively fixed. These expenses include
personnel costs, interest, rent, property taxes, insurance and utilities. If we are unable to decrease our costs
significantly or rapidly when demand for our parking concessions decreases, the decline in our net turnover can
have a particularly adverse effect on our net cash flows and profits. This effect can be especially pronounced
during periods of economic contraction or slow economic growth, such as the recent economic downturn. Where
cost cutting efforts are insufficient to offset declines in net turnover, we could experience a material decline in
margins and potentially negative cash flows which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results
of operations, financial condition or prospects.

**In our off-street and on-street parking concessions, the tariff rates that we can charge our customers are**
**governed by our concession agreements.**

The net turnover that we generate from our off-street and on-street parking concessions is dependent on our tariff
rates. The tariff structure is established under our concession agreements and we generally have limited or no
ability to independently raise tariffs beyond the contractual provisions (usually, based on the rate of inflation).
Before bidding for any concession project, we typically conduct an analysis to determine the conditions under
which we believe such concession can be operated profitably. If the assumptions underlying our analysis prove to
be incorrect and our tariffs do not generate sufficient revenues to cover our costs, we may be unable to increase
our tariffs or reduce our costs in order for the concession to remain profitable, which could materially adversely
affect our business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects. This effect could be compounded with
respect to our long-term concession agreements.

**If the Draft Law on the De-indexation of the Spanish Economy is approved, new and renewed concession**
**agreements may not include the right to increase tariffs in accordance with inflation, and in such case,**
**tariffs may only be increased in line with the direct cost of the services and goods provided under such**
**concession agreement.**

The current price revision regime applicable to concession tariffs may be altered in the future, as the Draft law on
the Re-Indexation of the Spanish Economy (“Anteproyecto de Ley de Desindexación de la Economía Española”)
proposes to prohibit formulas that link the review of tariffs to inflation levels. According to this draft legislation, the
Spanish Government would establish the elements of the tariffs that can be revised, as well as conditions and


-----

reference prices that can be taken into account when revising the tariff. These elements are limited to increases in
the cost of the underlying goods and services, such as energy costs, that are necessary in providing the services
under the concession agreement. Labor, financial and structural costs as well as industrial profit will not be taken
into account when revising the tariffs. Although this is still a Draft Law, should it be enacted, it may significantly
affect the tariffs to be charged under new or renewed concessions which could materially adversely affect our
business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects.

**The financial difficulties faced by municipalities that grant us concessions could materially adversely**
**affect our business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects.**

Most of our concession arrangements are with municipalities in Spain and Portugal. Under a majority of our onstreet concessions the municipality receives the parking revenues under those concessions and remits the
relevant concession fee to us. As a result, we bear credit risk with respect to these concessions and such credit
risk may be exacerbated by the impact of the recent economic downturn in Spain and Portugal and the austerity
measures imposed by the national governments. In the event that a municipality experiences financial difficulties,
we may not receive payments under the concessions for months, or even years, and may be obliged to continue
providing services under the concessions, regardless of such outstanding payments, which could materially
adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects. For example, in 2011, we
experienced a significant increase in working capital as a result of delays in payment by certain municipalities.
Additionally, in the event that we become entitled to receive compensation from a municipality under one of our
concessions, such payment could also be materially delayed.
**We might be required to complete formal licensing proceedings in Portugal that could result in our need**
**to seek additional approvals from the municipalities and to incur additional licensing taxes, costs, fines**
**and complementary sanctions for potential breaching of municipal licensing requirements.**

In general, surface rights agreements and administrative concessions in Portugal include clauses stipulating that
upon awarding of the surface right or the administrative concession, the operator shall seek approval from the
Portuguese municipality with respect to the construction project and, in a significant number of contracts, it is
further stipulated that the car park operation must begin upon the issuance of the applicable municipal use permit
(authorizing the use of a certain construction for a specific use). The understanding and practice of the majority of
Portuguese municipalities has been that, although the construction project is subject to municipal approval, the
construction is not subject to the licensing procedure to which constructions in general are subject, given the fact
that it has been widely understood that these are exempted from licensing in article 7 of Decree-Law no. 555/99
of December, as amended by Law no. 60/2007 and Decree-Law no. 26/2010, which states that the works
promoted by the Public Administration as well as works promoted by concessionaires of public works are exempt
from municipal licensing.

If municipalities were to require formal licensing to operate such parking facilities, this would require us to submit
additional projects and be charged with additional licensing taxes and costs in order to obtain such licenses we
may incur fines or be subject to sanctions for potential breaching of municipal licensing requirements. In addition,
in the event that such licenses are not granted, we may be unable to operate the relevant concession the
municipalities may argue that we have breached the relevant surface rights agreements and administrative
concessions, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition or
prospects.

In 2005, Emparque brought a legal action against the municipality of Lisbon to challenge its decision to deny
Emparque’s request that the parking facility in Marquês de Pombal (Lisbon, Portugal) be exempt from the
requirement to obtain a use permit. We did not prevail in the lower courts and have appealed this case to the
_Tribunal Central Administrativo. Should a final court ruling be issued against Emparque’s petition, Emparque may_
be required to initiate a new licensing procedure for the car park of Marquês de Pombal in order to obtain the
respective use permit, and we may not obtain such license.

**Under our concessions, in certain situations, an insolvency proceeding or a change of control may result**
**in the termination of the concession.**

Under the terms of our concessions and Spanish and Portuguese law, the municipality may terminate the
concession in the event that insolvency or winding-up proceedings are instituted. If an enforcement action is
brought under the Indenture or the Revolving Credit Facility, for example, we may be forced into insolvency or
winding-up proceedings that could give rise to such termination (subject to compensation for unamortized
investments). See “Regulation—Spain—Termination of the concession” and “Regulation—Portugal—Termination
_of the concession”. In any case, according to the Spanish Public Sector Contracts (Real Decreto Legislativo_


-----

_3/2011, de 14 de noviembre, por el que se aprueba el texto refundido de la Ley de Contratos del Sector Público)_
the “TRLCSP”, even where insolvency has been declared, the concession will not automatically be terminated by
the municipality. Such termination may only occur upon a declaration of insolvency: (i) the company is unable to
continue carrying on its business and fulfilling its duties and obligations; or (ii) the winding-up phase under
insolvency proceedings commences (and, in this latter case, transfer of the concession to a party authorized to
carry out such business might be done to avoid early termination).

Additionally, under some of our concessions in Cataluña, public authorities impose certain restrictions on the
transfers of ownership of the concessionaire, including a change of control clause, which prohibits the transfer of
the ownership of the concessionaire without the prior approval of the public authority. There is a risk that one or
more municipal councils might consider, in practice, that an indirect transfer also falls within the scope of this
restriction. Should the municipal councils of Cataluña apply such interpretation, it could be argued that such
interpretation goes beyond the stated legal provision. However, in the event of an enforcement action under the
terms of the Notes or Note Guarantees which resulted in the transfer of ownership of Empark, or a change in the
shareholding of Empark for other reasons, the local authorities may attempt to cancel our concessions in
Cataluña on such basis. In addition, the uncertainty concerning the transferability of such concessions itself could
reduce the value placed on the concessions by third parties and ultimately reduce the amount recovered in the
event of an enforcement action.

**We generate a substantial amount of revenues and cash flow from our concessions granted by various**
**municipalities. If we are unable to maintain our position as a reputable concessionaire, we may be unable**
**to win bids to renew our existing concessions or enter into new concessions, and our business, results**
**of operations, financial condition or prospects may be materially and adversely affected.**

In the year ended December 31, 2012, a substantial amount of our Adjusted EBITDA was generated under a
number of our key concession contracts and any limitations on our operations under these agreements or
reduced demand due to changes in traffic patterns could adversely affect our business, results of operations,
financial condition or prospects. Additionally, our risk is compounded as we are not geographically diversified,
with the vast majority of our operations being conducted in Spain and Portugal. If policies of either of these
municipalities change with respect to traffic patterns, or these municipalities experience further financial difficulties
that affect the payment of our fees under such concession agreements, or if the volume of traffic declines in these
locations, it could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects.
Additionally, these municipalities may ask us to enter into amendments to our concessions to lower the fees
payable to us or to agree to other terms which are less commercially favorable than the original agreements.
While municipalities may not unilaterally amend our concessions without indemnifying us for the damages we
suffer as a result of such changes, we may agree to such amendments in order to maintain our relationships with
the municipalities.

We believe the experience of our management, the quality of our reputation in the key markets in which we
operate and the rapport that we maintain with the municipalities differentiate us from our competitors and are
important factors for the generation of new business opportunities that support our growth. If we are unable to
maintain good working relationships with the municipalities and other third parties, or if we do not meet or exceed
their expectations, such parties may be unwilling to maintain or grow their relationship with us, in which case our
business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects may be materially and adversely affected.

**Changes in the legal framework for concessions may impose significant costs on us.**

The grant and operation of public concessions in Spain and Portugal is highly regulated. The legal framework
applicable to administrative concessions and other agreements under which we operate parking facilities is
subject to changes which could affect the profitability of our concessions and agreements. We must comply with a
variety of laws and regulations relating to our concessions, some of which impose substantial financial and other
penalties for non-compliance, including the revocation of a concession. In addition, we are exposed to the risk of
changes in the regulatory regime, which changes could potentially impose additional costs on our business, and
thus have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects. In the event
of significant regulatory changes we may request the awarding authority in certain circumstances to modify the
terms of the concession in order to restore the economic and financial balance of the relevant concession.
However, we can give no assurance that such an adjustment would be available, that it would apply to our
surface rights agreements in Portugal or that it would be on terms satisfactory to us or could be made in a timely
manner. If such adjustments are not made or do not provide for sufficient or timely increases in our revenues in
respect of such concession, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially
adversely affected. In any event, even if such rebalancing is successful, it would not generally address all the


-----

losses we may have already incurred. Additionally, court proceedings to obtain an order for economic rebalancing
of a concession may take a number of years to reach a conclusion and could result in costly and time-consuming
litigation, regulatory action or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial
condition or prospects.

Agreements entered into with private entities, although contractual in nature, are also subject to mandatory
private law legal provisions. Changes in the relevant legislation may also have a negative impact in our business,
results of operation, financial condition or prospects.

**We have minority partners for certain concessions and are a minority partner with respect to certain of**
**our other businesses.**

We operate a number of our concessions through entities in which we do not have a 100% stake. In some cases,
we have a majority ownership interest and have entered into a shareholders’ agreement with a minority partner in
connection with our bid for concessions in a particular region. In the twelve months ended September 30, 2013,
approximately 15.1% of Adjusted EBITDA was generated by entities or consortiums in which we have a majority
stake. For other concessions, we do not have a controlling interest in the entity holding the concessions since the
municipality requires that the majority stake be held by the municipality. In addition, in October 2013, we, through
a consortium in which we are the largest partner (holding a 35% interest), won a tender to manage one of the two
on-street parking zones into which Madrid is divided for the next 12 years. This agreement became effective from
November 1, 2013. We are exposed to risks associated with the conduct of our partners in connection with our
less than 100% owned business. For example, our partners may make poor management decisions, or may fail to
supply or be unwilling to supply the required operational, strategic and financial resources to the business. In such
cases, we may be required to dedicate more resources to manage such projects and as a result, management’s
attention may be diverted from existing operations to focus on such businesses. If any of our partners were to
encounter financial difficulties, change their business strategies or were no longer willing to participate in the
businesses, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely
affected. Moreover, in a number of the businesses, we do not have the power to control the payment of dividends
or other distributions, so even if the business is performing well, we may not be able to extract value through the
payment of our share of any profits. Our shareholder arrangements with such business partners may also require
us to provide additional investments or funding from time to time. For example, in respect of our temporary
consortium with other partners (uniones temporales de empresas), we are jointly and severally liable for the
obligations of the consortium vis-a-vis third parties and not only for our share of interest. In such cases, we may
be jointly and severally liable for amounts payable by the consortium and our partners may not reimburse us for
such payments. There may also be circumstances in which we may desire or be required to acquire the
ownership interests of our partners, and we may not have access to the funds necessary to do so. In addition, our
reputation and business, including our ability to retain and enter into new contracts with public authorities, could
be adversely impacted if any of our partners are alleged to have engaged in illegal or unethical conduct, such as
bribery, money laundering and other corrupt activities or membership in, or aiding, illegal organizations and we
may be liable for such activities if they occur in connection with any joint ventures.

**Instances of fraud, bribery and corruption involving our management, employees, business partners or**
**agents could expose us to penalties and reputational damage and could hinder our ability to acquire or**
**renew concessions or even continue our operating activities.**

The tender process and the award of concessions by public authorities involve risks associated with fraud, bribery
and corruption. Although, to our knowledge, there have been no instances of fraud, bribery or corruption involving
or affecting Empark, we may be unable to detect or prevent every instance of fraud, bribery and corruption
involving our employees, business partners or agents in the future. We may therefore be subject to civil and
criminal penalties and to reputational damage as a result of such occurrences. Instances of fraud, bribery and
corruption may also be taken into account as a negative factor by public authorities in considering our bids to
acquire or renew concessions and could result in a prohibition to tender, preventing us or making it more difficult
for us to win or renew concessions in the future. The involvement or association of our employees, business
partners, construction contractors, suppliers or agents with fraud, bribery or corruption, or allegations or rumors
relating thereto, could negatively impact our reputation and materially adversely affect our business, results of
operations, financial condition or prospects.

**Our ability to expand our business will be dependent upon the availability and cost of capital.**

The off-street concession segment of the Spanish and Portuguese parking industry is highly fragmented, and
there are opportunities for continued consolidation. We intend to continue to expand our business through organic


-----

growth. Our ability to expand our business will depend in part upon the availability of adequate capital, which in
turn will depend in large part upon cash flow generated by our business and the availability of debt and equity
financing. The recent economic downturn in Spain and Portugal and the effects of the credit crisis and recent
negative developments with respect to Euro zone financial markets have had a negative impact on the availability
and cost of our bank financing in Spain and Portugal. If we are unable to obtain the funds needed on acceptable
terms, we will not be able to continue to expand our operations, which could materially adversely affect our
business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects.

**We may fail to successfully carry out construction works under new off-street concessions and may not**
**recover our investment.**

When we are awarded a concession for a new parking site, we are exposed to a number of risks associated with
large-scale construction projects, such as the failure of our contractors and subcontractors to perform, as well as
delays and disruptions caused by technical or environmental problems, adverse weather conditions or other
factors. Generally, pursuant to the terms of the development agreements we enter into in connection with our
concessions, our contractors and subcontractors must indemnify us for any losses or delays resulting from delays
in developing the project and are required to post a performance bond as security for the performance of their
obligations. However, our losses may exceed the amount of the performance bond or the maximum loss
coverage under these agreements, in which case we would not be adequately compensated for losses derived
from construction delays. We may also be required to engage in costly litigation or arbitration proceedings in order
to receive compensation under these agreements. Further, our ability to obtain compensation under our
development contracts is dependent on the solvency of our contractors and subcontractors. Construction delays
will also postpone the time at which the parking facility will be operational and therefore the time from which we
will begin to receive revenues from a concession. Such delays will shorten the revenue-generating term of the
concession and may entitle the granting authority to impose sanctions or terminate the concession, any of which
could materially adversely affect our business, financial conditions, results of operations or prospects.

Once the construction of a parking facility on a new site is completed, we are exposed to a variety of risks in
connection with the opening and operation of the new facility, which could result in us failing to recover our
investment in the new facility. For example, the actual demand for parking spaces at the new site may not meet
our expectations, and we may experience lower than expected volumes and revenues.
**We may fail to realize the anticipated benefits from, or may incur unanticipated costs associated with,**
**future acquisitions and geographic expansion and we may also seek to divest some of our properties and**
**other assets, any of which may be unsuccessful or divert our management’s attention.**

We may, from time to time, consider acquisitions of other concession operators. We may also consider
opportunities to expand our operations into geographic markets outside of Spain and Portugal. Acquisitions and
geographic expansion can involve significant risks, such as the integration of the newly-acquired business, the
entry into unfamiliar markets and the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns. We may
not be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition opportunities in the future or complete future acquisitions.
If we do complete any acquisitions in the future, we may not be able to successfully integrate the newly-acquired
business and we may not realize the anticipated benefits from the acquisitions, or we may encounter
unanticipated costs associated with the acquisitions. We have expanded our business into markets such as
Turkey, the United Kingdom and more recently, Poland, and we may expand our presence further in those
countries, or enter into new markets in the future. As a result, we will be exposed to the risks inherent to such
markets. We may not be able to realize the expected benefits from such expansion.

If we fail to identify and enter into attractive markets, to find suitable business partners who can operate the
business effectively, ethically and on reasonable terms, to identify and operate concessions on acceptable terms,
to attract and hire skilled staff, to implement the required infrastructure or to raise the required funds, our business
plans may be jeopardized and the intended consolidation or increase of our market share may fail to materialize,
which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.

From time to time, we consider and engage in negotiations with respect to disposals of assets. In October 2013,
we signed a memorandum of understanding with a third party in connection with the proposed sale of one of our
parking facilities located on Calle Sevilla in Madrid for €22.5 million. Divestitures of some of our assets may yield
returns below our investment criteria or even result in investment losses. In addition, any acquisitions,
investments, dispositions or alliances may demand significant attention from our management that would
otherwise be available for our day-to-day running of the business.


-----

**Contractual and other disagreements with awarding entities and counterparties could make us liable to**
**them or result in litigation costs or other expenses, which could lower our profits. Under the terms of**
**some of our concessions, surface rights agreements and other agreements, the awarding entity and**
**counterparties may terminate such agreements if we do not successfully comply with our obligations.**
**This risk is exacerbated in those subsidiaries that are not wholly-owned, as we depend on the decisions**
**of other shareholders.**

From time to time, we are involved in contractual and other disagreements with municipalities relating to our
concession and surface rights agreements and our operations under such agreements. Such disagreements are
more likely to occur during periods of challenging economic conditions. For the duration of each concession and
surface rights agreements, we are required to maintain the relevant infrastructure asset in satisfactory condition,
and upon the expiration of each concession and surface rights agreements, we must surrender substantially all
assets related to such concession and surface rights agreements to the relevant municipality without financial
compensation. If municipalities claim that we have failed to comply with the terms of our concession and surface
rights agreements, the concession may be revoked or we may not be successful in extending the agreement at
the end of its term. Alternatively, municipalities may not pay us fees in the full amounts due under the terms of the
concession and surface rights agreements. Any such disputes or delays could materially adversely affect our
business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.

In addition, we operate a number of our agreement with majority partners and may, from time to time, participate
in consortiums over which we do not exercise control over the day to day operations and decision making
process. If a governmental authority decides to terminate or amend our concession agreements due to a serious
violation of our contractual or regulatory obligations, such as a failure to maintain the facility creating serious
danger to users or a persistent failure to make payments to the awarding authority, we may not be entitled to full
compensation for our initial investment or loss of anticipated profits. In addition, upon a serious breach of the
terms of the concession, the awarding authority could call due any performance bonds granted by us under the
concession agreement, in which case we would be required to immediately repay any such performance bonds
and indemnify the local authority for any damages claimed in excess of such performance bond amounts. In
agreements entered into with private entities, breach of contractual obligations may also lead to the termination of
said agreements. If any of our existing significant concessions, surface rights agreements or other agreements
are unilaterally terminated or amended by the relevant awarding authorities or counterparties, our revenues in the
future may be reduced, and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially
adversely affected.

**We may incur higher than expected costs as a result of unforeseen maintenance problems.**

Generally, our maintenance costs are relatively low once our concessions have been built and are operational.
However, many of our concessions are more than ten years old and may incur unforeseen problems such as
water damage, cracks in the walls or foundation or sinking. Under the terms of the concessions, we are
responsible for all maintenance and upkeep at our facilities, including structural repairs. If we were to experience
a significant problem requiring repairs, our maintenance costs may be higher than expected and we may have
limited operations at a particular facility for a period of time. Such expenses or reduction in revenue may have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.

**Labor disputes and other labor matters could lead to loss of revenues or higher costs.**

Most of our employees in Spain are represented by labor unions. In particular, due to its labor intensive nature,
our on-street parking business is subject to the risks associated with a unionized workforce and we have
experienced labor disputes that have led to strikes or other disruptions in our operations in the past. When one or
more of our major collective bargaining agreements becomes subject to renegotiation, we may disagree with the
union on important issues that, in turn, could lead to a strike, work slowdown or other industrial action. There can
be no assurance that we will be able to renew existing labor union contracts on acceptable terms. We can also
experience labor disputes in other situations, such as due to disagreements in work practices. A strike, work
slowdown or other action could in some cases result in the effective closure of our facilities, temporary free
parking at our facilities or disrupt us from providing services, which would result in reduced revenues. The result
of renegotiating an existing collective bargaining agreement could result in a substantial increase in labor costs
that we may be unable to recover through our existing contractual arrangements. Additionally, we may incur
expenses in resolving disputes and complying with local laws relating to overtime, social security and pension
contributions, occupational risk matters and other labor related issues. We may also incur increased labor costs
due to competition, increased minimum wage, employee benefit costs, medical benefits costs or otherwise could
adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects. Although we have not


-----

experienced any material collective labor disputes in the past, there can be no assurance that labor disputes will
not arise in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
operations or prospects. In addition, our employees may claim that they are subject to a more favorable collective
bargaining agreement, which may result in increased labor costs for us.

**If we fail to stay current with developments in technology necessary for our business, our operations**
**could be harmed and our ability to compete effectively could be diminished.**

Sophisticated information technology and other systems, including systems for the efficient collection and
management of revenue are integral to our business. Our information technology and other systems must be
refined, updated or replaced with more advanced systems on a regular basis. Developing and maintaining our
systems may require significant capital. If we are unable to replace or introduce information technology and other
systems as quickly as our competitors or within budgeted costs or schedules when these systems become
outdated or need replacing, or if we are unable to achieve the intended benefits of any new information
technology or other systems, our operations could be harmed and our ability to compete effectively could be
diminished, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations
or prospects. Further, if we fail to keep up with technological advances in our industry that maintain or improve
our cost-effectiveness or add value to the services we can offer to customers, we may not be eligible to
participate in or win competitive public tenders.

**Our information technology systems may fail or be interrupted, which could materially adversely affect**
**our business. Failure to maintain the integrity of internal or customer data could result in faulty business**
**decisions, harm to our reputation and subject us to costs, fines and lawsuits.**

We rely on numerous information technology systems that allow us to monitor and manage our parking
concessions and facilities, maintain our financial records, manage our employees and gather information upon
which our management makes decisions regarding our business, including technical information used in
formulating bids for concessions or contracts. The operation of our business is increasingly dependent on the use
of these systems. As a result, system failures or disruptions resulting from computer viruses, hackers or other
causes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or
prospects.

We also collect and retain large volumes of internal and customer data, including credit card numbers and other
personally identifiable information during the normal course of business. Using our various information technology
systems, we enter, process, summarize and report such data. We also maintain personally identifiable information
about our employees. The integrity and protection of our customer, employee and company data is critical to our
business. Our customers and employees expect that we will adequately protect their personal information, and
the regulations applicable to security and privacy are increasingly demanding in certain jurisdictions where we
operate. Theft, loss, fraudulent or unlawful use of customer, employee or company data could harm our reputation
and result in remedial and other costs, fines and lawsuits, which may be material.

**Natural disasters, acts of terrorism and other unexpected events could disrupt our services.**

Natural disasters, such as storms, earthquakes or floods, acts of terrorism and other unexpected events, such as
large-scale electrical power supply outages, fires and vandalism, may result in reduced revenues for our parking
businesses. Natural disasters may also cause economic dislocations throughout an urban area, region or country.
In addition, terrorist attacks have resulted in, and may continue to result in, heightened security and traffic control
measures in urban areas and increased government regulation of airport facilities. These events can result in
reduced traffic levels and decreased volumes for our parking facilities, and thus cause a reduction in revenues,
and our insurance may not be sufficient to cover claims arising from such events. Significant damage or
destruction to one of our facilities may also result in the termination of the concession, and if we were deemed to
be at fault for the damage we may be obligated to rebuild the facility without compensation. Additionally, such
events could cause interruptions in our monitoring or other information technology systems, which could
materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.
**Adverse litigation judgments or settlements resulting from legal proceedings in which we may be**
**involved in the normal course of our business could materially adversely affect our business, financial**
**condition, results of operations or prospects.**

In the normal course of business, we are involved in various legal proceedings. Such litigation may result from
injuries or property damage to our customers or their property while using our facilities, from claims arising
against us relating to construction at our facilities or breach of applicable laws and regulations, including laws


-----

relating to personal data protection obligations. In addition, we enter into partnerships with various business
partners and are members of trade associations and we may be jointly and severally liable for judgments or
claims made against such partners or trade associations. We may face litigation by competitors challenging the
award of a concession to us, and we may also litigate against our competitors in connection with the bidding
process. It is possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all such matters could cause us to incur significant
liabilities. Likewise, we may incur significant legal and other costs in connection with defending our interests in
ongoing legal proceedings. Any significant adverse litigation judgments or settlements could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.

**We are subject to changes in tax laws, tax rates and their application and interpretation in the markets in**
**which we operate, and we may be subject to significant claims related to future tax disputes and audits.**

Our operations that are profit making are subject to profit and income tax and other applicable taxes, such as
property tax. There is no guarantee that tax laws or tax rates may not be changed in the future. Any change in tax
laws or tax rates may increase our tax expenses and liabilities and could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects. We are subject to various tax proceedings and
audits with tax authorities in respect of our operations.

**Our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that we could suffer and our**
**insurance costs may increase.**

We maintain a portfolio of insurance policies to help protect us against loss or damage incurred from a wide
variety of insurable risks. Each year, we review with our professional insurance advisers whether the insurance
policies and associated coverage that we maintain are sufficient to adequately protect us from the various types
of risk to which we are exposed. That analysis takes into account various pertinent factors, such as the likelihood
that we would incur a material loss from any given risk, as well as the cost of obtaining insurance coverage
against any such risk. In addition, under the relevant Spanish laws, the operator of a parking facility is liable for
any damages to the vehicle and its contents. The provider of parking services is liable for movable components,
accessories or objects when certain conditions are met, including that such movable components, accessories or
objects are expressly declared by the user, that the provider of parking services expressly accepts their custody,
and that the user complies with security measures. Under Portuguese Law, although the provider of parking
services may be generally held liable for damages to vehicles and their attachments, the nature of such liability
and the legal requirements applicable thereto depend on the law deemed as applicable to the relationship
between the parking services provider and its customers. Notwithstanding our insurance coverage for all or any of
these risks, we may experience one or more material losses for which we do not maintain any or adequate
insurance coverage that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or
prospects.

**Our business is dependent upon key personnel.**

Our success has been, and will continue to be, substantially dependent upon the continued services of our senior
management team. The loss of the services of one or more of the members of our senior management team
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Although
several of our key senior managers are shareholders, and we have entered into employment agreements with,
and historically have been successful in retaining the services of, our senior management, there can be no
assurance that we will be able to retain them in the future and any failure to do so could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. We do not have any key man life
insurance in place. In addition, our continued growth depends upon our ability to attract and retain skilled
operating managers and employees.

**The interests of our shareholders may not correspond with your interests as a holder of the Notes.**

Over 97% of the shares of Empark are currently controlled by ASSIP and four infrastructure funds. As of the date
of this offering memorandum, ASSIP owned 50.3% of the capital stock of Empark. Under the arrangements in
effect among our shareholders, a number of major corporate actions require approval of our shareholders. The
members of our board of directors are nominated by our shareholders. Therefore, our shareholders have
significant control over our operations. The interests of our shareholders could conflict with the interests of the
holders of the Notes, particularly if we encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay our debts when due.
Our shareholders may also have interests in pursuing acquisitions, disposals and other transactions that, in their
judgment, could enhance their equity investment, even though these transactions might involve risks to holders of
the Notes. Our shareholders also may disagree over key decisions affecting our business, and such material


-----

disagreements could entitle shareholders to exercise any exit rights provided for under the Shareholders
Agreements described under “Major Shareholders—Shareholders Agreement” or could otherwise materially
adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.

**Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness**

**Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could adversely affect our business and prevent us**
**from fulfilling our obligations with respect to the Notes and the Note Guarantees.**

We are, and following the issuance of the Notes we will continue to be, highly leveraged. As of September 30,
2013, after giving pro forma effect to the Refinancing, we would have had total outstanding indebtedness of
€515.5 million, including the Notes.

The degree to which we will be leveraged following the issuance of the Notes could have important consequences
to holders of the Notes offered hereby, including, but not limited to:

- making it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes;

- increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse economic and
industry conditions;

- requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of interest on
our indebtedness and the repayment of principal, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to fund
working capital, capital expenditures, joint ventures or other general corporate purposes;

- limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the competitive environment
and the industry in which we operate;

- placing us at a competitive disadvantage as compared to our competitors, to the extent that they are not as
highly leveraged; and

- limiting our ability to borrow additional funds and increasing the cost of any such borrowing.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy our
debt obligations, including the Notes.
**We are subject to restrictive debt covenants that may limit our ability to finance our future operations and**
**capital needs and to pursue business opportunities and activities.**

The Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contain covenants that impose significant operating
and financial restrictions on us. These agreements limit our ability to, among other things:

- incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred stock;

- create or incur certain liens;

- make certain payments, including dividends or other distributions, with respect to the shares of the Parent
Guarantor;

- prepay or redeem subordinated debt or equity;

- make certain investments;

- create encumbrances or restrictions on the payment of dividends or other distributions, loans or advances to
and on the transfer of assets to the Parent Guarantor or its restricted subsidiaries;

- sell, lease or transfer certain assets including stock of restricted subsidiaries;

- consolidate or merge with other entities;

- impair the security interests for the benefit of the holders of the Notes; and

- amend certain documents.

All these limitations will be subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. The covenants to which we are
subject could limit our ability to finance our future operations and capital needs and our ability to pursue business
opportunities and activities that may be in our interest.

In addition, we will be subject to the affirmative and negative covenants contained in the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement. In particular, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement requires us to maintain certain financial ratios
based on our leverage levels. Our ability to meet these financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our


-----

control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet them. A breach of any of these provisions could result in a
draw stop or an event of default under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. Upon the occurrence of any event
of default under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, subject to applicable cure periods and other limitations
on acceleration or enforcement, the lenders could cancel the availability of the Revolving Credit Facility and elect
to declare all amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, together with accrued interest, immediately
due and payable. In addition, any default under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement could lead to an event of
default and acceleration under other debt instruments that contain cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions,
including the Notes. If our creditors, including the creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility, accelerate the
payment of those amounts, we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full those
amounts, to satisfy all other liabilities which would be due and payable and to make payments to enable the
Issuer to repay the Notes, in full or in part. In addition, if we are unable to repay those amounts, our creditors
could proceed against any Collateral granted to them to secure repayment of those amounts.

**We will require a significant amount of cash to service our debt and sustain our operations, which we**
**may not be able to generate or raise. Our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors**
**beyond our control.**

Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt, and to fund working capital and capital expenditures,
will depend on our future operating performance and ability to generate sufficient cash. This depends, to some
extent, on the success of our business strategy and on general economic, financial, competitive, market,
legislative, regulatory and other factors, as well as the other factors discussed in these “Risk Factors”, many of
which are beyond our control.
We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations, that we will realize
revenue growth and operating improvements that we anticipate or that future debt and equity financing will be
available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, including the Notes, or to fund our
other liquidity needs.

If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources (including borrowings under the Revolving
Credit Facility) are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be
forced to:

- reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditures;

- sell assets;

- obtain additional debt or equity capital; or

- restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity.

The type, timing and terms of any future financing will depend on our cash needs and the prevailing conditions in
the financial markets. We cannot assure you that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a
timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all. In addition, the terms of our Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and
the Indenture and any future debt may limit our ability to pursue any of these measures.

Any failure to make payments on our indebtedness, including the Notes, on a timely basis would likely result in a
reduction of our credit rating, which could also harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. In addition, the
terms of our debt, including the Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility, limit, and any future debt may limit, our
ability to pursue any of these alternatives, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, results of operations or prospects. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates
and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business, financial
condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that any assets which we could be required to
dispose of could be sold or that, if sold, the timing of such sale and the amount of proceeds realized from such
sale will be on a timely basis or in a sufficient amount.

**Despite our current level of indebtedness, we may still be able to incur substantially more debt in the**
**future, which may make it difficult for us to service our debt, including the Notes, and impair our ability to**
**operate our businesses.**

We will be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Although the Indenture and the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these
restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances,
the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with those restrictions could be substantial. In


-----

addition, the Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will not prevent us from incurring obligations
that do not constitute indebtedness under those agreements.

**The loans under our Revolving Credit Facility and the Floating Rate Notes will bear interest at floating**
**rates that could rise significantly, increasing our financing costs and reducing our cash flow.**

The Floating Rate Notes and any borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility will bear interest at a variable
rate which is based on EURIBOR plus an applicable margin. Fluctuations in EURIBOR or the occurrence of a
market disruption event may increase our overall interest burden and could have a material adverse effect on our
ability to service our debt obligations. We do not currently intend to enter into any new interest rate swaps with
respect to the Revolving Credit Facility and the Floating Rate Notes. To the extent that EURIBOR were to
increase significantly, our interest expense would correspondingly increase, thereby reducing our cash flow.
**Risks Relating to Our Structure**

**The Issuer is a finance subsidiary that has no material assets or revenue generating operations of its own**
**and will depend on cash received under the Funding Loans in order to be able to make payments on the**
**Notes.**

The Issuer is a finance subsidiary that was formed in order to offer and issue the Notes. The Issuer conducts no
business operations of its own, and has not engaged in, and will not be permitted to engage in, any activities
other than the issuance of the Notes and the incurrence of certain other permitted indebtedness, the advancing of
the Funding Loans and the Issuer Intercompany Loan to Empark, the servicing of its obligations under the Notes
and any other permitted indebtedness, and other activities permitted by the covenant described under
“Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—The Issuer”. The Issuer has no subsidiaries, and its only material
asset and only source of revenue is its right to receive payments on the Funding Loans from Empark. Therefore,
the ability of the Issuer to make payments on the Notes is therefore entirely dependent on the cash flows received
under the Funding Loans. Empark intends to provide funds to the Issuer in order for it to meet its obligations
under the Notes through interest payments on the Funding Loans. If Empark does not fulfill its obligations under
the Funding Loans, the Issuer will not have any other source of funds that would allow it to make payments to the
holders of the Notes. The amounts available to the Issuer from the other relevant members of the Group will
depend on the profitability and cash flows of such members of the Group and the ability of such members to make
payments to it under applicable law or the terms of any financing agreements or other contracts that may limit or
restrict their ability to pay such amounts. In addition, certain by-laws of members of the Group require approval by
a qualified majority of shareholders to make dividends distributions. Regarding legal limitations, for example,
Spanish and Portuguese corporate law provisions require, among other things, each of our subsidiaries to retain
at least 10% and 5% for Spain and Portugal, respectively, of the annual net profit (after covering accumulated
losses) in a legal reserve until the reserve reaches at least 20% of such company’s share capital and that, after
payment of any dividend or distribution of reserves, equity (“patrimonio neto” in Spain or “capital próprio” in
Portugal) must not fall below such company’s share capital (plus non-distributable reserves for Portugal). Also, no
distributions can be made while any costs of incorporation, research or development have not been fully written
off, unless the amount of distributable reserves (free reserves for Portugal) and retained earnings is at least equal
to the amount of the abovementioned costs that have not been fully written off. Additionally, under Spanish law a
non-distributable reserve equivalent to goodwill accounted for in the balance sheet must be created and under
Portuguese law certain non-distributable reserves must be created for fair value increases. Therefore operating
companies in the Group may not be able to, or may not be permitted under applicable law to, due to the described
corporate law provisions and also due to foreign exchange laws and regulations that could limit or tax the
remittance of dividends or transfer payments abroad, make distributions or advance payments, directly or
indirectly, to Empark in order for Empark to make payments to the Issuer on the Funding Loans. If such payments
are not made, the Issuer will not be able to make any payments in respect of the Notes.

Various agreements governing the Group’s debt may restrict, and in some cases, may prevent the ability of the
members of the Group to transfer funds within the Group. In such circumstances, holders of the Notes would have
to rely upon claims for payment under the Guarantees, and payment under the Guarantees is subject to the risks
and limitations described in the “Risks Relating to the Notes—Certain of the Note Guarantees will be limited to a
_specified amount, and each Note Guarantee will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be_
_limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability.” The_
members of the Group that do not guarantee the Notes have no obligation to make payments with respect to the
Notes.

**The Notes will each be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of non-Guarantor subsidiaries.**


-----

Some, but not all, members of the Group will guarantee the Notes. The Guarantors generated 78.1% and 79.9%
of the Group’s Adjusted Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA, respectively, for the twelve months ended
September 30, 2013, and held 95.7% of the Group’s total assets (and 63.4% of the Group’s tangible and
intangible assets, excluding goodwill) as of September 30, 2013. Our non-Guarantor subsidiaries generated
21.9% and 21.1% of the Group’s Adjusted Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA, respectively, for the twelve months
ended September 30, 2013, and held 4.3% of the Group’s total assets (and 36.6% of the Group’s tangible and
intangible assets, excluding goodwill) as of September 30, 2013. Certain of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries are
not wholly owned.

Unless a company is a Guarantor, such company will not have any obligation to pay amounts due under the
Notes or to make funds available for that purpose. Generally, holders of indebtedness of, and trade creditors of,
non-guarantor subsidiaries, including lenders under our Project Finance Facilities and bank financing agreements,
are entitled to payments of their claims from the assets of such subsidiaries before these assets are made
available for distribution to any Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder. As of September 30, 2013, the NonRecourse Entities had €102.2 million of outstanding non-recourse indebtedness which would be structurally
senior to the Notes.

Accordingly, in the event that any non-Guarantor subsidiary becomes insolvent, is liquidated, reorganized or
dissolved or is otherwise wound up other than as part of a solvent transaction:

- the creditors of the Issuer (including the holders of the Notes) and the Guarantors will have no right to proceed
against the assets of such subsidiary; and

- creditors of such non-Guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors, will generally be entitled to payment in full
from the sale or other disposal of the assets of such subsidiary before any Guarantor, as a direct or indirect
shareholder, will be entitled to receive any distributions from such subsidiary.

As such, the Notes and each Note Guarantee will be structurally subordinated to the creditors (including trade
creditors) and any preferred stockholders of non-Guarantor subsidiaries.

**The Issuer may not be able to recover any amounts under the Funding Loans because its right to receive**
**payments under the Funding Loans is subordinated to all third-party liabilities of Empark.**

Under Spanish insolvency law, as described below, the Funding Loans will be characterized as subordinated
obligations of Empark, and will be subordinated in an insolvency proceeding to the preferential and ordinary debts
of Empark since the Issuer and Empark will be considered “specially related entities” for the purposes of Spanish
insolvency law. Therefore, if Empark is declared insolvent, the claims of both preferred and ordinary third-party
creditors shall rank prior to the claims of the Issuer and such third-party creditors shall first receive all available
funds until their claims are satisfied. In such circumstances, there may not be sufficient funds remaining to repay
amounts outstanding under the Funding Loans, either in whole or in part.

**Risks Relating to the Notes**

**Creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging liabilities are entitled to be repaid in full**
**with the proceeds of the Collateral sold in any enforcement sale in priority to the Notes.**

The obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees are secured on a first-ranking basis with security
interests over Collateral which also secures our obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain
hedging obligations on a pari passu basis. The Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement also permit
the Collateral to be pledged to secure additional indebtedness in accordance with the terms thereof and the
Intercreditor Agreement.

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the liabilities under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging
obligations will have priority over the Notes with respect to amounts received from the sale of the Collateral
pursuant to an enforcement action taken with respect to the Collateral. As such, in the event of a foreclosure of
the Collateral, holders of the Notes will receive less from the proceeds of security in an enforcement or insolvency
scenario than if they were not required to share the proceeds. Moreover, holders of the Notes may not be able to
recover on the Collateral if the then outstanding claims under the Revolving Credit Facility and such amount in
respect of priority hedging obligations are greater than the proceeds realized.

Any proceeds from an enforcement sale of the Collateral by any creditor will, after all priority obligations under the
Revolving Credit Facility and such amount in respect of such hedging obligations have been discharged from
such recoveries, be applied pro rata in repayment of the Notes and any other obligations ranking pari passu with
the Notes and secured by the Collateral. The Intercreditor Agreement provides that a common Security Agent,


-----

who will also serve as the security agent for the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility, hedging obligations
and any additional secured debt permitted to be incurred by the Indenture or the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement, will act only as provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement. In general, the facility agent under the
Revolving Credit Facility and any agent with respect to any permitted future secured debt will have, subject to
certain restrictions in connection with, among others, the ability to provide enforcement instructions to the Security
Agent, the right to enforce the shared Collateral.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent shall act on instructions provided by Majority Super
Senior Creditors (as defined under “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement—Enforcement
_by Holders of Secured Debt”) and the Majority Pari Passu Creditors (as defined under “Description of Other_
_Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement—Enforcement by Holders of Secured Debt”). The Security Agent will act_
in accordance with enforcement instructions received from the Majority Pari Passu Creditors; provided, however,
that the Security Agent will act in accordance with enforcement instructions received from the Majority Super
Senior Creditors if (a) the obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain Super Senior hedging
obligations have not been fully discharged within six months of such enforcement instructions first being issued,
(b) the Majority Pari Passu Creditors have not either made a determination as to the method of enforcement they
wish the Security Agent to pursue or appointed a financial adviser to assist them in making such a determination
within three months of the date such instructions are issued, (c) the Majority Pari Passu Creditors have not either
made a determination as to the method of enforcement they wish the Security Agent to pursue or appointed a
financial adviser to assist them in making such a determination and the Majority Super Senior Creditors determine
in good faith that a delay in issuing enforcement instructions could reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on the proceeds expected to be realized from the enforcement, or (d) an Insolvency Event (as
defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) occurs in respect of an obligation of an obligor or a Material Company.
See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement—Enforcement by Holders of Secured Debt”.
The lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging counterparties or lenders of any other future
class of debt that ranks pari passu with the indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility may have interests
that are different from the interests of holders of the Notes and they may, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement, elect to pursue their remedies under the Security and Guarantee Documents at a time when it would
be disadvantageous for the holders of the Notes to do so.

**The Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Collateral that has been granted as**
**security for the Notes and the Note Guarantees, and such security may not be sufficient to satisfy the**
**obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.**

If there is an event of default on the Notes, the holders of the Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value
of the Collateral granted as security for the Notes. Not all our assets secure the Notes. In the future, the
obligations to provide additional guarantees and grant additional security over assets, or a particular type or class
of assets, whether as a result of the acquisition or creation of future assets or subsidiaries, the designation of a
previously unrestricted subsidiary as a restricted subsidiary or otherwise, is subject to the Indenture, the Agreed
Security Principles and the Intercreditor Agreement. The Agreed Security Principles (as set out in the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement) set out a number of limitations on the rights of the holders of the Notes to require
granting of, or payment or enforcement under, a guarantee or security in certain circumstances. Accordingly, the
Agreed Security Principles may affect the value of the guarantees and security to be provided by us and our
subsidiaries. The terms of the security documents securing obligations under the Notes and applicable guarantee
limitations may result in, among other things, the amount recoverable under any guarantee or security provided
by any subsidiary being limited or security not being granted over a particular type or class of assets. Accordingly,
the Agreed Security Principles may affect the value of the guarantees and security provided by us and our
subsidiaries. The validity and enforceability of the guarantees and security may also be affected by local law
limitations. See “Risks Relating to the Notes—Certain of the Note Guarantees will be limited to a specified
_amount, and each Note Guarantee will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by_
_applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability.”_

The Collateral comprises (i) a first-ranking security interest over 99.9% of the issued and outstanding shares of
Empark, (ii) a first-ranking security interest over all the issued and outstanding shares of the Issuer, Emparque
(but only following the conversion of the shares thereof to bearer form), Dornier, S.A., Femet, S.A.,
Estacionamientos Guipuzcoanos, S.L. and Balsol 2001, S.A., (iii) a first-ranking security interest over 43.0% of
the issued and outstanding shares of EULSA, (iv) a first-ranking security interest over 24.5% of the issued and
outstanding shares of SMASSA, (v) a first-ranking security interest over all the Issuer’s credit rights under the
Funding Loan Agreements and the Issuer Intercompany Loan Agreement, (vi) a first-ranking security interest over
all the credit rights under certain of the Guarantors’ Spanish off-street concessions (which includes the rights to


-----

receive compensation, payments and owed amounts under the concession agreements) and (vii) a first-ranking
security interest over certain bank accounts of the Issuer and the Spanish Guarantors, as more specifically
described under “Description of the Notes—Security”. No appraisals of any Collateral have been prepared, and
there is no requirement to provide funds to enhance the value of the Collateral if it is insufficient. The proceeds of
any sale of the Collateral following an event of default with respect to the Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy,
and may be substantially less than, amounts due on the Notes.

The value of the Collateral and the amount to be received upon an enforcement of such Collateral will depend
upon many factors, including whether or not our business is sold as a going concern, the jurisdiction in which the
enforcement action or sale is completed, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, economic conditions
where operations are located and the availability of buyers. Further, there may not be any buyer willing and able
to purchase our business as a going concern, or willing to buy the Collateral in the event of an enforcement
action. The Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value.

By its nature, some or all the Collateral may not have a readily ascertainable market value or may not be saleable
or, if saleable, there may be substantial delays in its disposal. To the extent that other first-priority security
interests, pre-existing liens, liens permitted under the Indenture or the Revolving Credit Facility and other rights
encumber the Collateral securing the Notes, those parties may have or may exercise rights and remedies with
respect to the Collateral that could adversely affect the value of the Collateral and the ability of the Security Agent
to realize or foreclose on the Collateral. There may also be other practical problems generally associated with the
realization of security interests in the Collateral. For example, under Luxembourg law, the enforcement of share
pledges, whether by means of a sale or an appropriation, is subject to certain specific requirements. The Security
Agent may also need to obtain the consent of a third party to enforce a security interest. We cannot assure you
that the Security Agent will be able to obtain any such consents. We also cannot assure you that the consents of
any third parties will be given when required to facilitate a sale of, or foreclosure on, such assets. Accordingly, the
Security Agent may not have the ability to sell or foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Collateral may
significantly decrease.

Each security interest granted over the Collateral will be limited in scope to the value of the relevant assets
expressed to be subject to that security interest, and enforcement of each Security and Guarantee Document
would be subject to certain generally available defenses. These laws and defenses include those that relate to
corporate benefit, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate interest,
capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. See “EU,
_Spanish, Portuguese and Luxembourg Insolvency Laws” and “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the_
_Note Guarantees and Security Interests”._

If the proceeds of any sale of Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes and the Note
Guarantees, holders of the Notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would
have only an unsecured claim against the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ remaining assets. Each of these factors or
any challenge to the validity of the Collateral or the intercreditor arrangements governing our creditors’ rights
could reduce the proceeds realized upon enforcement of the Collateral. In addition, there can be no assurance
that the Collateral could be sold in a timely manner, if at all. Proceeds from enforcement sales of the Collateral
must first be applied in satisfaction of certain priority obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and
counterparties under certain hedging obligations (and any other future indebtedness that ranks pari passu with
the Revolving Credit Facility and such hedging obligations) and thereafter towards application to repay on a pari
_passu basis the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantor under the Notes and any other pari passu debt. In_
addition, the Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will allow the incurrence of certain additional
permitted debt in the future that is secured by the Collateral on a priority or pari passu basis.

**The issuance of the indebtedness contemplated under the Refinancing may not be permitted by certain of**
**our financing agreements as of the Issue Date.**

We have sought waivers under certain of our existing financing agreements in order to facilitate the Refinancing,
including the Offering of the Notes. To the extent that we are unable to obtain such waivers, the issuance of the
Notes and the incurrence of indebtedness under our Revolving Credit Facility may not be permitted under such
existing financing agreements. As a result, we may be required to repay and terminate such facilities. As of
September 30, 2013, the aggregate outstanding amount under those existing financing agreements was
approximately €5 million.

We intend to repay in full the Existing Credit Facilities and to terminate the Existing Credit Facilities in connection
with the Refinancing. We will instruct the Initial Purchasers to direct the payment of the proceeds of this Offering,
together with the borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility on the Issue Date, to repay the Existing Credit


-----

Facilities and related expenses. See “Use of Proceeds”. Under the Existing Credit Facilities Agreement, we are
required to provide ten business days’ prior notice to the facility agent in order to prepay all outstanding amounts
due thereunder. Although we intend to repay the Existing Credit Facilities in full on the Issue Date, we will not
deliver such prepayment notice to the agent until the Issue Date and as a result, such Existing Credit Facilities
may not be discharged on the Issue Date. To the extent that the Existing Credit Facilities are not discharged on
the Issue Date, the incurrence of the indebtedness under the Notes and the borrowings under the Revolving
Credit Facility will not be permitted under the Existing Credit Facilities Agreement. As a result, the Refinancing,
including this Offering, may trigger a breach under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Indenture during the ten
business day period between the Issue Date and the date of discharging the Existing Credit Facilities.

**The Notes and the Note Guarantees will not be secured by the Collateral on the Issue Date.**

Although the Security and Guarantee Documents will be entered into on the Issue Date, the Notes and the Note
Guarantees will not be secured by the Collateral on the Issue Date. The discharge of the Existing Credit Facilities
is expected to occur within ten business days following the Issue Date. Furthermore, the secured parties under
the Existing Credit Facilities are permitted to refuse to release the security thereunder for up to 15 business days
following the discharge of the Existing Credit Facilities with respect to the Portuguese security, and up to 20
business days following the discharge of the Existing Credit Facilities with respect to the Spanish security. The
Issuer has agreed to take all necessary actions to perfect and make effective the security interest in the Collateral
to be granted in favor of the Security Agent (for the benefit of the holders of the Notes, among others), subject to
the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security and Guarantee Documents, as soon as practicable and
in any event substantially concurrently with the perfection of the security interest in the Collateral granted to
secure the obligations of the obligors under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Security and Guarantee Documents
will become effective only following the satisfaction of the conditions subsequent set forth therein, including the
release of the security pledged in connection with the Existing Credit Facilities. In addition, the Collateral may be
subject to certain perfection requirements in order to be enforced. Accordingly, although we will endeavor to
complete all steps necessary to perfect the security over the Collateral as soon as practicable, we cannot provide
any assurances as to when the security to be granted over the Collateral to secure the Notes and the Note
Guarantees will be perfected, if at all. See “Description of the Notes—Security—General” and “—The Security
_Agent may not be able to enforce a portion of the Collateral if certain actions are not taken to register and perfect_
_the security interests in the Collateral”._

**Certain of the Note Guarantees will be limited to a specified amount, and each Note Guarantee will be**
**subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain**
**defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability.**

Each Note Guarantee provides the holders of the Notes with a direct claim against the relevant Guarantor.
However, the Note Guarantees of Emparque and Esli-Parques de Estacionamento, S.A. will each be limited to a
maximum amount of €29.97 million and €25.32 million, respectively. The Indenture will provide that each Note
Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by the relevant Guarantor without
rendering the relevant Note Guarantee, as it relates to that Guarantor, voidable or otherwise ineffective or limited
under applicable law, and enforcement of each Note Guarantee would be subject to certain generally available
defenses. Enforcement of any of the Note Guarantees against any Guarantor will be subject to certain defenses
available to Guarantors in the relevant jurisdiction. Although laws differ among these jurisdictions, these laws and
defenses generally include those that relate to financial assistance, corporate interest or benefit, fraudulent
conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, insolvency or bankruptcy challenges, preservation of share capital,
thin capitalization, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors
generally. If one or more of these laws and defenses is applicable, a Guarantor may have no liability or decreased
liability under its Note Guarantee depending on the amounts of its other obligations and applicable law.
Limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in New York courts in such jurisdictions could limit the
enforceability of any Note Guarantee against any Guarantor.

Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under bankruptcy or insolvency law and other laws, a
court could (i) avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Note Guarantee, (ii) direct
that the holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Note Guarantee to the relevant Guarantor or to a
fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s creditors or (iii) take other action that is detrimental to you, typically if the
court found that:

- the relevant Note Guarantee was incurred with actual intent to give preference to one creditor over another,
hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the Guarantor or, in certain jurisdictions, when the


-----

granting of the Note Guarantee has the effect of giving a creditor a preference or when the recipient was aware
that the Guarantor was insolvent when it granted the relevant Note Guarantee;

- the Guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value or corporate benefit for the
relevant Note Guarantee and the Guarantor was: (i) insolvent or rendered insolvent because of the relevant
Note Guarantee, (ii) undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the relevant Note Guarantee or
(iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity;

- the relevant Note Guarantee was held to exceed the corporate objects of the Guarantor or not to be in the best
interests or for the corporate benefit of the Guarantor (under these circumstances any Note Guarantee granted
within two years in Spain or Portugal prior to a declaration of insolvency may be unconditionally extinguished);
or

- the amount paid or payable under the relevant Note Guarantee was in excess of the maximum amount
permitted under applicable law or against financial assistance laws.

These or similar laws may also apply to any future guarantee granted by any of our subsidiaries pursuant to the
Indenture.

We cannot assure you which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor was “insolvent” at
the relevant time or that, regardless of method of valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor was
insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor was
insolvent on the date its Note Guarantee was issued, that payments to holders of the Notes constituted
preferences, fraudulent transfers or conveyances on other grounds.

The liability of each Guarantor under its Note Guarantee will be limited to the amount that will result in such Note
Guarantee not constituting a preference, fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise
being set aside. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court will apply in making a
determination of the maximum liability of each Guarantor. There is a possibility that the entire Note Guarantee
may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished.

If a court decided that a Note Guarantee was a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance and voided such
Note Guarantee, or held it unenforceable for any other reason, you may cease to have any claim in respect of the
relevant Guarantor and would be a creditor solely of the Issuer and, if applicable, of any other Guarantor under
the relevant Note Guarantee which has not been declared void. In the event that any Note Guarantee is invalid or
unenforceable, in whole or in part, or to the extent the agreed limitation of the Note Guarantee obligations apply,
the Notes would be effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor, and if we cannot satisfy
our obligations under the Notes or any Note Guarantee is found to be a preference, fraudulent transfer or
conveyance or is otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you that we can ever repay in full any amounts
outstanding under the Notes.

**_Spanish Guarantee Limitations_**

Spanish law prohibits financial assistance for Spanish stock companies (sociedades anónimas) in relation to the
acquisition of their own shares or the shares of any direct or indirect parent company. Therefore, any guarantee,
security or indemnity granted or assumed pursuant to the Indenture by the Spanish Guarantors shall not extend to
any payment obligation incurred by the Issuer for the purpose of acquiring the shares of such Guarantor or the
shares of its direct or indirect parent company, to the extent that such guarantee or indemnity would constitute
unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of Section 150 of Spanish Companies Act (Real Decreto
_Legislativo 1/2010, de 2 de julio, por el que se aprueba el texto refundido de la Ley de Sociedades de Capital)._
Guarantees or indemnities granted in breach of financial assistance limitations can be considered null and void,
and can result in the imposition of fines to the relevant directors of the companies committing the infraction.

**_Portuguese Guarantee Limitations_**

Under Portuguese law, claims may become time-barred (20 years being the ordinary term set forth under article
309 of the Portuguese Civil Code and may be or become subject to the defense of set-off or counterclaim.

The terms “enforceable”, “enforceability”, “valid”, “legal”, “binding” and “effective” (or any combination thereof)
mean that all of the obligations assumed by the relevant party under the relevant documents are of a type
enforced by Portuguese courts; the terms do not mean that these obligations will necessarily be enforced in all
circumstances in accordance with their terms. Enforcement before the courts will, in any event, be subject to:

- the degree to which the relevant obligations are enforceable under their governing law;

- the nature of the remedies available in the courts; and


-----

- the availability of defenses such as (without limitation) set-off, fraud, abuse of rights (abuso de direito), violation
of public policy principles, duress, misrepresentation, undue influence, conflict of interests, force majeure,
exception non adimplenti contractus, error, abatement and counterclaim.

As a general rule, under Portuguese law, any guarantee, pledge or mortgage must guarantee or secure another
obligation to which it is ancillary, which must be clearly identified in the relevant guarantee or security agreement.
Therefore, the guarantee or security interest follows the underlying obligation in such a way that nullity of the
underlying obligation entails nullity of the guarantee or security and termination of the underlying obligation entails
termination of the guarantee or security. In the event that the security providers are able to prove that there are no
existing and valid guaranteed obligations, Portuguese courts may consider that the security providers’ obligations
under the relevant guarantees or security are not enforceable.

Pursuant to Portuguese Law the provision of Guarantees or Collateral in favor of third parties is not allowed,
unless (i) the company has a justified corporate interest in the granting of the Guarantees and/or of the Collateral
or (ii) the company is in a group or control relationship with the beneficiary of the Guarantees and/or of the
Security.

In addition, the obligations under Guarantees or Collateral granted by the Portuguese Guarantors shall not extend
to any use of the proceeds of the Notes for the purpose of acquiring shares representing the share capital of such
Guarantor or shares representing the share capital of the Parent Guarantor, or refinancing a previous debt
incurred for the acquisition of shares representing the share capital of such Guarantor or shares representing the
share capital of its Parent Guarantor, i.e. said obligations cannot include granting of Guarantees or Collateral
which would constitute unlawful financial assistance pursuant to article 322 of the Portuguese Companies Code,
approved by Decree Law 262/86 of September 2 (Código das Sociedades Comerciais), which might arise since
part of the Existing Credit Facilities were used to purchase Emparque. In this respect, all provisions of such
Guarantee or Collateral shall be construed accordingly in the sense that in no case can any Guarantee or
Collateral granted by a Portuguese Guarantor secure repayment of the above-mentioned funds.

Guarantees or indemnities granted in breach of financial assistance limitations will be considered null and void,
and may result in the imposition of fines to the relevant directors of the companies committing the infraction.

Moreover, the Portuguese Guarantors will be entitled to claim for themselves immunity from suit, execution,
attachment or other legal process in respect of their obligations under the Note Guarantees to the extent that their
assets are covered by the immunities legally set forth, which include, but are not limited to, assets that are part of
the public domain of the Portuguese Republic (domínio público do Estado) or allocated to public service
purposes.

**The Security Agent may be required to pay certain Portuguese stamp taxes on behalf of the holders of the**
**Notes in order to enforce the security interest over the issued and outstanding shares of Emparque in**
**Portugal.**

The first-ranking security interest over all the issued and outstanding shares of Emparque will be limited to a
maximum amount of €40 million with respect to the Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility. The security interest
over the issued and outstanding shares of Emparque will be granted in favor of the Security Agent for the benefit
of the holders of the Notes and the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility. Under Portuguese law, certain
stamp taxes are required to be paid at the time of enforcement in Portugal with respect to a pledge over the
bearer shares of a Portuguese company granted outside Portugal. The Security Agent may be required to pay
stamp tax in order to enforce the Portuguese share pledge at the time of such enforcement. The payment of such
stamp taxes by the Security Agent would reduce the amount recovered in the event of an enforcement action in
Portugal.
**There are circumstances other than the repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Collateral**
**securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be released automatically, without your consent or the**
**consent of the Trustee.**

Under various circumstances, the Collateral securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be released
automatically, including:

- in connection with any sale or other disposition of the assets of a Guarantor, if the sale or other disposition
does not violate the “Asset Sale” provisions of the Indenture;

- if Empark designates any restricted subsidiary to be an unrestricted subsidiary in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the Indenture;


-----

- upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture as provided under
“Description of the Notes—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” and “Description of the Notes—
_Satisfaction and Discharge”;_

- in accordance with the “Amendment, Supplement and Waiver” provisions of the Indenture; or

- as otherwise set forth under “Description of the Notes—Security—Release”.

In addition, under various circumstances, the Note Guarantees will be released automatically, including:

- in connection with any sale or other disposition of all or substantially all the assets of a Subsidiary Guarantor
(including by way of merger or consolidation) to a person that is not Empark or one of its restricted subsidiaries
if the sale or other disposition does not violate the “Asset Sale” provisions of the Indenture, and all obligations
of that Subsidiary Guarantor with respect to other Indebtedness of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries
are also released;

- in connection with any sale of all the capital stock of a Subsidiary Guarantor to a person that is not (either
before or after giving effect to such transaction) Empark or one of its restricted subsidiaries, if the sale or other
disposition does not violate the “Asset Sale” provisions of the Indenture, and all obligations of that Subsidiary
Guarantor with respect to other Indebtedness of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries are also
released;

- if Empark designates any restricted subsidiary that is a Guarantor to be an unrestricted subsidiary in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the relevant Indenture;

- upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture as provided under
“Description of the Notes—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance”;

- in accordance with the “Amendment, Supplement and Waiver” provisions of the Indenture; or

- as otherwise set forth under “Description of the Notes—Release of Note Guarantees”.

In addition, the Note Guarantees and Collateral will each be subject to release upon an enforcement sale as
contemplated under the Intercreditor Agreement. Unless consented to, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that
the Security Agent shall not, in an enforcement scenario, exercise its rights to release the relevant Note
Guarantees or security interests in the Collateral unless the relevant sale or disposal is made:

- for consideration, all or substantially all of which is in the form of cash;

- to the extent there is a release of Note Guarantees or security granted for the benefit of the holders of Notes,
concurrently with the discharge or release of the indebtedness of the disposed entities to certain other
creditors, including the creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility and holders of the Notes; and

- pursuant to a public auction, or if a fairness opinion has been obtained from an internationally recognized
investment bank or accounting firm selected by the Security Agent.
See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of the Notes”.

**The security interests in the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to the**
**holders of the Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce certain of the Collateral may be**
**restricted by local law.**

The security interests in the Collateral that will secure the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the
obligations of the Guarantors under the Note Guarantees will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes
but will be granted only in favor of the Security Agent, except for the Collateral governed by Spanish and
Portuguese law, which will be granted in favor of the holders of the Notes acting through the Security Agent. The
Indenture will provide (along with the Intercreditor Agreement) that only the Security Agent has the right to enforce
the Security and Guarantee Documents. As a consequence, holders of the Notes will not have direct security
interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes, except
through the Trustee, who will (subject to the provisions of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement) provide
instructions to the Security Agent in respect of the Collateral.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if enforcement of any security interest in Spain and Portugal was to be carried out
by the Security Agent in Spain and Portugal, it may be necessary to prove that the Security Agent is duly and
expressly empowered for such purpose by means of duly notarized powers of attorney granted in favor of the
Security Agent by each of the actual or future creditors, if necessary, with the Apostil of The Hague Convention


-----

dated October 5, 1961. Therefore, there could be a delay in the execution of the Collateral in Spain and Portugal
while the Security Agent obtains such powers.

The granting of security interests in favor of a foreign security agent (acting for and on behalf of third-party
beneficiaries) would be recognized under Luxembourg law (i) to the extent that the designation of such security
agent is valid under the law governing its appointment and (ii) subject to the type of the security interests granted.
Generally, according to article 2(4) of the Luxembourg law dated August 5, 2005 concerning financial collateral
arrangements, as amended (the “Collateral Act 2005”), a security interest which constitutes financial collateral (in
accordance with the provisions of the Collateral Act 2005) may be provided in favor of a person acting on behalf
of the beneficiary(ies) of such security interest(s), a fiduciary or a trustee in order to secure the claims of thirdparty beneficiaries, whether present or future, provided that these third-party beneficiaries are determined or may
be determined. Without prejudice to their obligations vis-à-vis the third party beneficiaries of the security, persons
acting on behalf of beneficiaries of the security interest(s), the fiduciary or the trustee benefit from the same rights
as those of the direct beneficiaries of the security interest(s) provided under the Collateral Act 2005.

**The Security Agent may not be able to enforce a portion of the Collateral if certain actions are not taken to**
**register and perfect the security interests in the Collateral.**

The liens on certain of the Collateral securing the Notes may not be enforceable with respect to the claims of the
Notes if we, or the Security Agent, fail or are unable to take certain actions to register, record or cause the
recognition of these liens.

The amendment of paragraph 6 of section 1 of article 90 of the Spanish Insolvency Law (Ley 22/2003 de 9 de
_julio, Concursal), which became effective on January 1, 2012, could be interpreted to require registration with a_
public registry of pledges over future credit rights (prenda de derechos de crédito futuros) or pledges securing
future credit rights (prenda en garantía de derechos de crédito futuros) prior to a pledgor’s declaration of
insolvency in order to maintain the Security Agent’s security interests in the Collateral. Empark and the Issuer
have agreed to take all necessary actions to perfect the security interests in the Collateral to the extent required
under the relevant Security and Guarantee Documents executed on the Issue Date, subject, in each case, to the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (including the Agreed Security Principles) and the requirements set forth in
such Security and Guarantee Documents, as soon as practicable and in any event substantially concurrently with
any perfection of the security interest in the Collateral granted to secure the obligations of the obligors under the
Revolving Credit Facility. As a result, registration of the pledges of certain of the Guarantors’ Spanish off-street
concessions and the first-ranking pledges over certain bank accounts of the Issuer and the Spanish Guarantors
with the relevant registries will not be completed until after the closing of the Offering. The existing doctrine
regarding the interpretation of this article is not settled, therefore no uniform interpretation of either this article or
the scope of the obligation to register the pledge can be provided.

With respect to the pledge over 43.0% of the issued and outstanding shares of EULSA, there are no legal
impediments under public law or in the terms of tender to validly pledge the shares of EULSA. However, the
current secretary of the Board of EULSA, which is not controlled by Empark but is part of the relevant municipal
council, has indicated that EULSA will not recognize this pledge of shares and that this pledge will not be
recorded in the share register. The pledge of 43.0% of the issued and outstanding shares of EULSA is being
made by Empark through Dornier, S.A., which is wholly-owned and controlled by Empark. As a result, in the event
of an enforcement, neither EULSA nor the other shareholders will necessarily recognize the pledge of shares or
recognize any party other than Dornier, S.A. as a shareholder of EULSA.

Failure or inability to take actions to register, record or cause the recognition of liens on certain of the Collateral
securing the Notes could impair the Security Agent’s ability to enforce that Collateral.

**The Issuer and the Guarantors will have control over the Collateral securing the Notes, and the sale of**
**particular assets could reduce the pool of assets securing the Notes.**

The Security and Guarantee Documents will allow the Issuer and the Guarantors to remain in possession of,
retain exclusive control over, freely operate, and collect, invest and dispose of any income from the Collateral
securing the Notes. So long as no default or event of default under the Indenture would result therefrom, the
Issuer and the Guarantors may, among other things, without any release or consent by the Security Agent,
conduct ordinary course activities with respect to the Collateral, such as selling, factoring, abandoning or
otherwise disposing of the Collateral and making ordinary course cash payments, including repayments of
indebtedness.

**We may not be able to obtain the funds required to repurchase Notes upon a Change of Control.**


-----

The Indenture will contain provisions relating to certain events constituting a “Change of Control” of Empark. Upon
the occurrence of a Change of Control, we will be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes at a price
equal to 101% of their principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any,
to the date of repurchase. If a Change of Control were to occur, we cannot assure you that we would have
sufficient funds available at such time, or that we would have sufficient funds to provide to the Issuer to pay the
repurchase price of the outstanding Notes or that the restrictions in our Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the
Intercreditor Agreement or our other then existing contractual obligations would allow us to make such required
repurchases. A Change of Control may result in a prepayment event or an event of default under, and the
acceleration of, our Revolving Credit Facility and other indebtedness. The repurchase of the Notes pursuant to
such an offer could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not. The
ability of the Issuer to receive cash from other members of the Group to allow the Issuer to pay cash to the
holders of the Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by our existing financial
resources. In addition, under the terms of our Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, under certain circumstances,
we are required to repay a pro rata amount of debt under our Revolving Credit Facility if we repay all or a portion
of the principal under the Notes. Sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required
repurchases. If an event constituting a Change of Control occurs at a time when the Group is prohibited from
providing funds to the Issuer for the purpose of repurchasing the Notes, we may seek the consent of the lenders
under such indebtedness to the purchase of the Notes or may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain
such prohibition. If such consent to repay such borrowings is not obtained, the Issuer will remain prohibited from
repurchasing any Notes. In addition, we expect that we would require third-party financing to make an offer to
repurchase the Notes upon a Change of Control. We cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain such
financing. Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes would constitute a default under the Indenture
which would, in turn, constitute a default under the Revolving Credit Facility. See “Description of the Notes—
_Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change of Control”._

The Change of Control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event
of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring, merger or other similar transaction
involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power
or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a “Change of Control” as defined in the Indenture.
Additionally, there are certain exceptions to the definition of “Change of Control” which allow changes in the
ownership of Empark if certain conditions are satisfied. Except as described under “Description of the Notes—
_Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change of Control”, the Indenture will not contain provisions that would_
require the Issuer to offer to repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a reorganization, restructuring,
merger, recapitalization or similar transaction.

The definition of “Change of Control” in the Indenture will include a disposition of all or substantially all the assets
of the Parent Guarantor and its restricted subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any person. Although there is a
limited body of New York case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all”, there is no precise established
definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of
uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” the Parent
Guarantor’s assets and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a
change of control has occurred and whether the Issuer is required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes.

**The interests of holders of Floating Rate Notes and the interests of the holders of Fixed Rate Notes may**
**be inconsistent.**

The Floating Rate Notes and the Fixed Rate Notes will be issued pursuant to a single indenture and will vote as a
single class with respect to amendments, waivers or other modifications of the Indenture other than with respect
to amendments, waivers or other modifications that will only affect the Fixed Rate Notes or the Floating Rate
Notes. The Floating Rate Notes will bear interest at a floating rate, will have a different call schedule and call
protection and will have other features that will differ from the Fixed Rate Notes. As a result of these differences,
the interests of holders of the Floating Rate Notes and the interests of holders of the Fixed Rate Notes could
conflict. In addition, the holders of one series of Notes may be in a position to agree to certain terms in a consent
solicitation that would be beneficial to such series of Notes but adverse to the economic interest of the other
series of Notes; however, to the extent the relevant amendment or waiver is approved by the holders of a majority
in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (subject to the limited exceptions described above),
all holders of the Notes will be bound by such amendment.

**If Spanish tax authorities determine that income derived from the Notes or the Note Guarantees should be**
**treated as Spanish source income, tax at a 21% rate could apply. Such tax might be collected by**


-----

**withholding or by payment by holders of the Notes. In certain situations, we could be required to gross-**
**up any such payments or reimburse holders for the amount of any tax imposed and this could materially**
**affect our financial position.**

Under the Spanish Non-Resident Income Tax Legislation, the Spanish tax authorities may determine that, under
certain circumstances, payments on the Notes or the Note Guarantees should be treated as Spanish source
income subject to tax at a 21% rate. By virtue of Royal Decree-Law 20/2011, tax rates mentioned in this section
were increased in principle only for 2012 and 2013. Nevertheless, the draft national budget bill for 2014 (currently
under discussion in the Spanish Parliament) amends that rules, and establishes an extension of the increased tax
rates for 2014.

We have been advised that, under applicable Spanish tax rules, holders of the Notes should not be subject to
such tax, and that all payments of principal and interest made with respect to the Notes or the Note Guarantees
should be made free and clear of any withholding or deduction of any taxes, duties, assessments or governmental
charges of any nature whatsoever which may be imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by the Kingdom
of Spain or any political subdivision or authority thereof or therein. However, there is no clear precedent to support
this position.

If such tax were imposed by withholding any payments on the Notes or the Note Guarantees, the Indenture
requires us, in certain situations, to gross-up any such payments to cover the full amount of the taxes required to
be withheld. If you are obligated to make payments as a result of such tax, we would be obligated under the
Indenture to reimburse you for the full amount of the taxes required to be paid. The amounts we would be
required to gross-up or reimburse could be substantial and could materially adversely affect our financial condition
and results of operations.

**There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may**
**be limited.**

We cannot assure you as to the liquidity of any market in the Notes, your ability to sell your Notes or the prices at
which you would be able to sell your Notes. Future trading prices for the Notes will depend on many factors,
including, among other things, prevailing interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities.
Historically, the market for non-investment grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused
substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. The liquidity of a trading market for the Notes
may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities and is subject to disruptions
that may cause volatility in prices. The trading market for the Notes may attract different investors and this may
affect the extent to which the Notes may trade. It is possible that the market for the Notes will be subject to
disruptions. Any such disruption may have a negative effect on you, as a holder of the Notes, regardless of our
prospects and financial performance. As a result, there is no assurance that there will be an active trading market
for the Notes. If no active trading market develops, you may not be able to resell your Notes at a fair value, if at
all.

Although an application will be made for the Notes to be listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange and admitted to trading on the Euro MTF market, we cannot assure you that the Notes will be or will
remain listed. Although no assurance is made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of the admission to
trading on the Euro MTF market, the failure to be approved for listing or the delisting (whether or not for an
alternative admission to listing on another stock exchange) of the Notes from the Official List of the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange may have a material effect on a holder’s ability to resell the Notes, as applicable, in the
secondary market.

**Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may be**
**subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time.**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The credit ratings address
our ability to perform our obligations under the terms of the Notes and credit risks in determining the likelihood
that payments will be made when due under the Notes. The ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all risks
related to the structure, market and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes, including the additional
risk factors discussed above. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be
subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No assurance can be given that a
credit rating will remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or
withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. A
suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the Notes by one or more of the


-----

credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost and terms and conditions of our financings and could
adversely affect the value and trading of the Notes.

**The transfer of the Notes is restricted, which may adversely affect their liquidity and the price at which**
**they may be sold.**

The Notes and the Note Guarantees have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act or
the securities laws of any state or any other jurisdiction and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold in
the United States, except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration
requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and the applicable securities laws of any state or any other jurisdiction.
We have not agreed to or otherwise undertaken to register any of the Notes or the Note Guarantees, and do not
have any intention to do so. See “Notice to Investors”. It is the obligation of holders of the Notes to ensure that
their offers and sales of the Notes within the United States and other countries comply with applicable securities
laws.

**You may be unable to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities laws violations.**

We are organized under the laws of Luxembourg. All our directors and executive officers and the directors and
executive officers of the Guarantors are non-residents of the United States and all their assets are located outside
the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process within the
United States upon us, the Guarantors or our or their respective directors and executive officers, or to enforce any
judgments obtained in U.S. courts predicated upon civil liability provisions of the U.S. securities laws. In addition,
we cannot assure you that civil liabilities predicated upon the Federal securities laws of the United States will be
enforceable in Luxembourg, Spain or Portugal. See “Enforcement of Civil Liabilities”.

**The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form, and therefore you must rely on the procedures of the**
**relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies.**

Owners of the book-entry interests will not be considered owners or holders of the Notes unless and until
definitive notes are issued in exchange for book-entry interests. Instead, the common depositary (or its nominee)
for Euroclear and Clearstream will be the sole registered holder of the Notes in global form.

Payments of principal, interest and other amounts owing on or in respect of the Notes in global form will be made
to Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, the Principal Paying Agent, which will make payments to Euroclear and
Clearstream. Thereafter, such payments will be credited to Euroclear and Clearstream participants’ accounts that
hold book-entry interests in the Notes in global form and credited by such participants to indirect participants.
After payment to the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, none of the Issuer, the Guarantors, the
Trustee or any paying agent will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or
payments of interest, principal or other amounts to Euroclear and Clearstream, or to owners of book-entry
interests. Accordingly, if you own a book-entry interest in the relevant Notes, you must rely on the procedures of
Euroclear and Clearstream and, if you are not a participant in Euroclear and/or Clearstream, on the procedures of
the participant through which you own your interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of the Notes
under the Indenture.

Owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right to act upon our solicitations for consents or requests
for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes, including enforcement of security for the Notes. Instead, if
you own a book-entry interest, you must rely on the common depositary (as registered holder of the Notes) to act
on your instructions and will be permitted to act directly only to the extent you have received appropriate proxies
to do so from Euroclear and Clearstream or, if applicable, from a participant. We cannot assure you that
procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies will be sufficient to enable you to vote on any requested
actions or to take any other action on a timely basis.

**Provisions of the EU Savings Directive and other legislation may adversely affect your investment in the**
**Notes.**

Under EC Council Directive 2003/48/EC on the taxation of savings income (the “EU Savings Directive”), each
Member State is required to provide to the tax authorities of another Member State details of payments of interest
or other similar income (which, arguably, may include payments made under guarantees) paid by a person within
its jurisdiction to, or collected by such a person for, an individual resident or certain limited types of entities
established in that other Member State; however, for a transitional period, Austria and Luxembourg may instead
apply a withholding system in relation to such payments, deducting tax at 35 percent. The transitional period is to
terminate at the end of the first full fiscal year following agreement by certain non EU countries to the exchange of

information relating to such payments. In April 2013, the Luxembourg Government announced its intention to
abolish the withholding system with effect from January 1, 2015 in favor of automatic information exchanges
under the EU Savings Directive.

A number of non EU countries (including Switzerland), and certain dependent or associated territories of certain
Member States, have adopted similar measures (either provision of information or transitional withholding) in
relation to payments made by a person within its jurisdiction to, or collected by such a person for, an individual
resident or certain limited types of entities established in a Member State. In addition, the Member States have
entered into provision of information or transitional withholding arrangements with certain of those dependent or
associated territories in relation to payments made by a person in a Member State to, or collected by such a
person for, an individual resident or certain limited types of entities established in one of those territories.

The European Commission has proposed certain amendments to the EU Savings Directive, which may, if
implemented, amend or broaden the scope of the requirements described above. Investors who are in any doubt
as to their position should consult their professional advisers.

In addition, the Issuer undertakes that it will ensure that it maintains a paying agent in a Member State of the
European Union that is not obliged to withhold or deduct tax pursuant to European Council Directive 2003/48/EC
or any other Directive implementing the conclusions of the European Council of Economics and Finance Ministers
(“ECOFIN”) meeting of November 26-27, 2000 or any law implementing or complying with, or introduced in order
to conform to, such Directive.

# Use of Proceeds

The gross proceeds from the Offering will be €384,250,000, after giving effect to the original issue discount with
respect to the Floating Rate Notes as stated on the cover of this offering memorandum. The Issuer will use the
gross proceeds from the Offering to make the Funding Loans to Empark pursuant to the Funding Loan
Agreements. Empark will apply the gross proceeds of the Funding Loans, together with borrowings under the
Revolving Credit Facility and cash in hand, to, directly or indirectly, (i) prepay and discharge all outstanding debt
under the Existing Credit Facilities, together with all accrued interest thereon, (ii) pay break costs and termination
fees in connection with the repayment and cancellation of the Existing Credit Facilities and the unwinding of
certain interest rate swaps relating to the Existing Credit Facilities and (iii) pay other costs and expenses related
to the foregoing transactions, as further described below.

The following table sets forth the estimated sources and uses of funds in connection with the Refinancing on the
Issue Date:

**Sources of Funds** **Uses of Funds**

**(€ in millions)** **(€ in millions)**

Notes offered hereby[(1)] ....................... 385.0

Revolving Credit Facility[(2)] .................. 22.5 Repayment of Existing Credit Facilities[(3)] 399.2

Cash in hand...................................... 12.7 Transaction costs and expenses[(4)] .... 21.0

**Total Sources...................................** **420.2 Total Uses ........................................** **420.2**

(1) The gross proceeds from the offering of the €150,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate Notes will be €149,250,000, reflecting an
issue price of 99.50%. The net proceeds of the Notes were €378,475,000.

(2) We expect to enter into the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement on or prior to the Issue Date. The Revolving Credit Facility thereunder will provide
for up to €30 million of borrowings. We intend to draw €22.5 million of borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility on the Issue Date, which we
expect to repay using proceeds received in connection with the Calle Sevilla Parking Facility Sale. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—
_Revolving Credit Facility Agreement”._

(3) The amount shown includes €390.1 million of principal amount outstanding under the Existing Credit Facilities as of September 30, 2013 and €9.1
million of accrued interest to September 30, 2013. Accrued interest from September 30, 2013 to the Issue Date, which we estimate to be in the
amount of €5.7 million, has not been included in the amount shown in the table. The Existing Credit Facilities will be repaid in full no later than ten
business days after the Issue Date with the proceeds from this Offering, borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and cash in hand. The
Existing Credit Facilities bear interest at EURIBOR plus a margin of 4% or 4.5%, depending on the tranche, and have a maturity of July 2016 or
July 2017, depending on the tranche.

See footnote (2) under “Capitalization” for a reconciliation of the amount of outstanding indebtedness under the Existing Credit Facilities as of
September 30, 2013 (including accrued interest to September 30, 2013 and excluding unamortized debt issue costs) to the amount of
indebtedness required to be repaid under the Existing Credit Facilities in order to repay and discharge such facilities in full.

(4) The amount shown represents estimated fees and expenses associated with the Refinancing, including (i) certain break costs and termination
fees in connection with the repayment and cancellation of the Existing Credit Facilities, (ii) €9.4 million of costs in connection with the unwinding of
certain interest rate swaps relating to the Existing Credit Facilities, (iii) discounts and commissions of the Initial Purchasers, (iv) financing fees
associated with the Revolving Credit Facility and (v) other transaction costs and advisory and professional fees in connection with the Refinancing.

cash and other equivalent liquid assets shown at September 30, 2013 may not be representative of actual amounts of cash and other equivalent
liquid assets at subsequent dates.

(2) Represents outstanding indebtedness under the Existing Credit Facilities as of September 30, 2013 (including accrued interest to September 30,
2013 and excluding unamortized debt issue costs). All amounts outstanding under the Existing Credit Facilities, including accrued interest,
together with break costs and termination fees in connection therewith, if any, will be repaid in full as part of the Refinancing and the Existing
Credit Facilities will be fully discharged and cancelled.

The following table presents a reconciliation of the principal amount of indebtedness under our Existing Credit Facilities as of September 30, 2013
(including accrued interest to September 30, 2013 and excluding unamortized debt issue costs) to the amount of indebtedness required to be

# Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

_The following is a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations (1) as of and for the_
_years ended December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012 as derived from the audited consolidated financial statements of_
_the Group for the same periods, except as otherwise indicated, in each case prepared in accordance with IFRS_
_and (2) as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 and 2013 as derived from the unaudited_
_consolidated financial statements of the Group for the same periods, except as otherwise indicated, in each case_
_prepared in accordance with IAS 34._

_You should read this discussion in conjunction with the sections entitled “Presentation of Financial and Other_
_Information”, ‘‘Summary—Summary Financial, Operating and Other Information’’, “Selected Historical_
_Consolidated Financial Information” and ‘‘Capitalization’’, as well as the consolidated financial statements and the_
_accompanying notes included elsewhere in this offering memorandum._

_This discussion includes forward-looking statements, which, although based upon assumptions that we consider_
_to be reasonable, are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from_
_those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. For a discussion of the risks and uncertainties_
_which we face, see “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors’’._

**Overview**

We are the largest concessionaire and operator of parking infrastructure in the Iberian Peninsula, as measured by
number of parking spaces and revenues. We mainly operate underground car parks (“off-street”) and parking
areas on city streets (“on-street”) under concessions and surface rights agreements from public authorities. As of
September 30, 2013, our portfolio comprised over 310 concessions with more than 160 municipalities and other
contracts with customers such as AENA and ANA, under which we manage over 355,000 parking spaces in
Spain and Portugal. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2013, our net turnover was €177.6 million, our
Adjusted Revenue was €180.4 million and our Adjusted EBITDA was €62.4 million. Our operations in Spain
represented 76.1% of our net turnover, 76.2% of our Adjusted Revenue and 66.7% of our Adjusted EBITDA for
the twelve months ended September 30, 2013.

We have served the Iberian market since the late 1960s, when there were fewer competitors in the developing car
park sector. We believe this has given us a “first mover” advantage, whereby we have secured long-term
concessions and built a portfolio of prime parking locations in Spain and Portugal, including in city centers,
airports and other high density traffic areas, such as hospitals and business districts. Due to a variety of physical,
regulatory and other constraints, we believe that there is limited opportunity to develop alternative parking options
in many of these prime areas, allowing us to benefit from captive demand with limited competition.

We generate revenues under three business lines:

- _Off-street concessions. Our off-street concession business primarily comprises long-term concessions granted_
by municipalities to develop and operate underground or multi-story parking facilities, and represented 46.3%
of our Adjusted Revenue and 78.6% of Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended September 30, 2013.
Under these contracts, we are generally required to invest in the construction of a new parking facility (a “green
_field” concession) or make an upfront payment to the municipality for an existing parking facility (a “brown field”_
concession). We operate each parking facility on a long-term basis and generate our fees based on tariffs
charged to car park users, as set out in the relevant concession or surface rights agreement, which typically
increase each year in line with inflation. We generally retain all fees generated from operating the relevant
parking facility and are responsible for all expenses relating to operating and maintaining the parking facility
during the term of the concession. With respect to “brown field” concessions, we may pay an annual
concession fee to the municipality. In addition, we sell a limited number of parking spaces to local residents as
an ancillary activity in connection with the development of some parking facilities. As of September 30, 2013,
we had 172 off-street concession contracts with 76 municipalities. The Weighted average remaining duration of
our off-street concessions is approximately 28 years.

- _On-street concessions. Our on-street concession business comprises concessions granted by municipalities to_
manage meter-controlled on-street parking, and represented 41.1% of our Adjusted Revenue and 22.1% of
Adjusted EBITDA in the twelve months ended September 30, 2013. For these types of contracts, we typically
receive fixed fees that are inflation-indexed and which cover the yearly amortized amount of our initial


-----

investment and operating costs. In a number of concessions, the contract also includes a variable incentive
element (which may be based on a percentage of the collected meter receipts, the number of parking spaces
or certain other quality indicators) to align the concessionaire’s objectives with optimizing revenue collection.
As of September 30, 2013, we had 139 on-street concession contracts with 125 municipalities. The Weighted
average remaining duration of our on-street concessions is approximately seven years. Since the beginning of
2010, we have renewed approximately 80% of our expiring on-street concessions for which we submitted bids.
In addition, we also won a number of our competitors’ contracts and overall our Adjusted EBITDA from onstreet concessions grew in each of 2010, 2011 and 2012.

- _Off-street contract management. Our off-street contract management business involves contracts to manage_
parking facilities on behalf of public authorities, primarily airports, as well as a limited number of private entities.
Our off-street contract management business represented 12.6% of our Adjusted Revenue and had Adjusted
EBITDA of €(0.4) million in the twelve months ended September 30, 2013. Under these contracts, we operate
and manage parking facilities on behalf of third parties in exchange for a fixed fee. Although it is a relatively
small part of our overall business, our off-street contract management business line allows us to leverage our
expertise in managing car parks to improve our cash flow with minimal capital costs.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2013 and the year ended December 31, 2012, the Adjusted Revenue
and Adjusted EBITDA represented by each of our business lines was as follows:

**Factors affecting results of operations**

**_Business lines_**

Our Adjusted EBITDA margins vary by business line among our off-street concession, on-street concession and
off-street contract management business lines. In general, our long-term off-street concessions have the highest
Adjusted EBITDA margins among our different types of concessions, but also involve the largest up-front
investments. There is significant variation in Adjusted EBITDA margins among our off-street concessions, with
some concessions generating significantly greater Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margins than others.
Our on-street concession and off-street contract management businesses tend to have lower Adjusted EBITDA
margins than our off-street concession business, but also require minimal investment and face lower demand risk
because a smaller proportion of our revenue depends on volumes or occupancy. For our off-street concessions,
as well as many of our on-street concessions and other contracts, our revenue comes primarily from the
payments we receive from customers to use the parking spaces on a “pay as you go” (hourly) or subscription
(monthly or yearly) basis. We also generate revenue from the sale of parking spaces, primarily to local residents.
In our on-street concessions, we generate revenue under a number of different pricing models. The most
common model is for us to receive a fixed fee which we withhold from the funds collected from the metered
parking spaces. In a number of concessions, the contract also includes a variable incentive element (which may


-----

be based on a percentage of the collected meter receipts, the number of parking spaces or certain other quality
indicators) to align the concessionaire’s objectives with optimizing revenue collection. Under some of our onstreet concessions, we receive the entire amount of tariffs collected from users. For our contracts in the off-street
contract management business, our revenue primarily consists of the fixed fees we receive from the owner of the
facility for managing the parking facilities.

**_Concession cycle_**

Our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA are affected by how much time has passed since our new off-street
concessions became operational. The revenue and Adjusted EBITDA of new car parks gradually increase in the
first three to four years after they become operational, and then remain fairly stable with, in most cases, moderate
increases due to inflation adjustments and volume increases (largely reflecting increased demand due to traffic
increases in cities) for the remaining duration of the concession. Off-street concessions can generate significant
net turnover and Adjusted EBITDA in the first year they become operational if we sell parking spaces to local
residents as an ancillary activity in connection with the development of some parking facilities since we record the
sale of such parking spaces as net turnover at the time of sale. We have developed and commenced operating
several large parking facilities since 2010. As a result, 9.9%, 12.6% and 0.2% of our net turnover was attributable
to the sale of parking spaces to local residents, as required by the terms of the relevant concession in the years
ended December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively. See “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Cash flows
_from investment activities” below. We do not expect that sales of parking spaces will remain a significant factor_
affecting our results of operations in future periods.

**_Demand risk_**

The revenues from our off-street concessions are influenced by demand and volumes, which primarily depends
on the location of the particular concession. On-street concessions and off-street contract management
arrangements have less demand risk because the bulk of the revenues from such arrangements are based on a
fixed fee. Our concessions are also affected by changes in the traffic flow in cities, which in turn directly impacts
demand. Traffic flow in urban areas can be affected by a number of factors, including changes in economic
activity in an area, local traffic regulations and gasoline prices. Parking can also be affected by general economic
conditions, but we believe to a lesser degree than in other infrastructure businesses because end users view
many trips during which they use our parking facilities as non-discretionary. We have experienced a decline in
volumes during the recent economic downturn but our Adjusted EBITDA remained relatively stable due to the
inflation indexing under our concessions and contracts, growth in our concession portfolio and the diversified mix
in our business lines under which some of our revenues are fixed. In addition, we have implemented various
measures to increase our revenues and improve EBITDA as further described under “Summary—Strategy—
_Maintain focus on growing revenue and improving EBITDA”._

**_Obtaining new concessions and contracts_**

Off-street concessions, which represented 78.8% of our Adjusted EBITDA in 2012, offer stable cash flows given
the long-term nature of these contracts (which can be up to 50 years if they include the obligation to carry out
construction works). The Weighted average remaining duration of our off-street concessions and contracts is
approximately 28 years. Cash flows with respect to our on-street concession business are potentially less stable
because such concessions come up for renewal more frequently (approximately every seven years). Increasing
our revenues is dependent in part on obtaining new concessions and winning concessions from our competitors
when they are up for renewal, while maintaining our existing concessions. Since the beginning of 2010, we have
achieved a renewal rate of approximately 80% with respect to on-street contracts and concessions for which we
submitted bids when they came up for tender. Furthermore, in both Spain and Portugal, we have won
approximately 63% of the tenders for new on-street contracts and concessions, and approximately 36% of the
expiring on-street contracts and concessions that were previously operated by our competitors, in each case for
which we submitted bids since the beginning of 2010. Recently, municipalities have increased the duration for
certain on-street concessions put up to tender in exchange for higher initial fee payments payable by the
concessionaire. For example, we have an on-street concession with a term of 20 years in Huelva. We also have
an on-street concession which runs for 15 years in Huesca and in Madrid we recently won an on-street
concession which runs for 12 years. We believe this trend of increasing the duration of on-street concessions in
exchange for higher upfront payments by the concessionaire benefits us given our size, scale and well
established position within the market. In addition, from time to time we may make acquisitions which meet our
stringent financial requirements, which will in turn expand our portfolio of concessions.


-----

**_Cost control initiatives and EBITDA improvements_**

We seek to increase our revenue through obtaining new concessions and winning concessions from our
competitors when they are up for renewal. We also seek to increase our revenue in our off-street concession
business by increasing volumes and occupancy through a well defined pricing policy, including with respect to our
season ticket offering, tariff structure and special offers and promotions. In our on-street concession business, we
seek to grow our revenue by improving our on-street revenue collection through the implementation of best
practices, so as to improve our variable incentive compensation payments under the relevant concession.
Additionally, we anticipate that revenues from our large parking facilities opened in the past three years will
increase over the coming years as they are currently in the “ramp up” phase. Since a substantial portion of our
revenue is largely stable and predictable as a result of being generated under existing long-term concessions and
contracts, one of the drivers of EBITDA is our ability to control costs. The nature of our costs varies between our
business lines. In our off-street concession business, we are generally required to make a significant capital
expenditure upfront in connection with our investment in a new parking facility or an upfront payment to the
municipality for an existing facility. Once that initial expense has been incurred, our off-street costs primarily relate
to personnel costs, maintenance costs (primarily cleaning and painting) and utilities and such costs are largely
fixed. In our on-street concession business, our upfront costs are considerably lower and may consist of a lumpsum payment to the municipality or relate to the acquisition and installation of on-street parking control equipment,
such as parking meters. After that initial investment has been made, most of our on-street costs consist of
personnel costs. In our off-street contract management business, our costs consist primarily of personnel costs
and the fixed fees that we pay to the owner of the parking facility, with maintenance accounting for only a small
portion of costs. We have implemented a number of measures by which we have successfully reduced costs,
including the introduction of technological innovations to help increase productivity and the number of parking
spaces covered per employee. We have introduced a centralized system to control and manage a substantial
majority of our off-street parking facilities from a remote location, which has allowed us to reduce personnel costs
by reducing headcount while maintaining our high quality of services and customer satisfaction levels. In addition,
such measures have helped us to reduce our reliance on external service providers by enabling us to reallocate
personnel to perform certain functions previously performed by third party service providers. Furthermore, we
have introduced energy saving measures to drive energy efficiency improvements, such as implementing
automatic devices to regulate lighting in our car parks, as well as carrying out active monitoring and management
of energy prices through negotiation with utility providers. We continue to seek opportunities to further reduce
costs and improve EBITDA.

**Key Line Items**

**Net turnover**

Net turnover consists primarily of the parking fees and other revenue we receive from customers for use of
parking spaces and fees from municipalities and other entities for managing parking spaces and facilities. The
fees we charge users and the fees we receive for managing parking spaces and facilities are typically indexed to
inflation. Net turnover also includes revenue from the sale of parking spaces to local residents as an ancillary
activity in connection with the development of some parking facilities. For the sale of parking spaces, we
recognize revenues at the time the parking space is sold, which coincides with the time at which the relevant
contract is signed. In our on-street concession business, in which we may be paid a fixed fee by the municipality,
we recognize revenue with respect to such fixed fees when the service is provided to the municipality. Revenue is
recognized when the value can reliably be determined and all contingencies have been resolved, and it is
probable that we will receive the future economic benefits. In our off-street concession business, revenues are
recorded either when the hourly rate is paid or on an accrual basis for season ticket holders. For those
concessions in respect of which we are paid a fee linked to the amount of collected meter receipts, we recognize
revenue with respect to such fee at the time of such collection.

**Other operating income**

Other operating income consists of revenue from certain basic amenities provided to car park users within our
parking facilities (for example, revenue from vending machines and car washes) and other services and products
provided or sold to car park users, as well as other non-recurrent revenue which is “one off” in nature.

**Adjusted Revenue**

We define Adjusted Revenue as net turnover plus other operating income less other non-recurrent revenue less
other “one off” or non-recurring gains and losses (including gains and losses realized from the sale of parking


-----

spaces to local residents and gains and losses realized on the sale of parking facilities). Adjusted Revenue is a
non-IFRS measure that we use to evaluate our operating and financial performance and should not be considered
as an alternative measure to accounting measures under IFRS. See “Presentation of Financial and Other
_Information”._

**Variation in stock of finished products and products in process**

Variation in stock of finished products and products in process represents the costs of the parking spaces that are
sold. We determine these costs by allocating the construction costs associated with such spaces. Such expense
is recognized at the time the corresponding revenue for the sale is recognized. See “—Amortization of fixed
_assets” below._
**Supplies**

Supplies consists of the cost of goods and materials bought that are necessary to provide customers with the
relevant services, including tickets for our automated ticket machines and other materials.

**Personnel costs**

Personnel costs includes employee wages, salaries and other expenses, as well as redundancy payments, social
security, pensions and similar costs. The majority of our personnel costs are incurred with respect to our on-street
concession business and, to a lesser extent, our off-street contract management business.

**Other operating expenses**

Other operating expenses primarily consists of costs for external services including information technology and
other outsourced services such as security and shuttle buses at airports. This expense category also includes
overhead costs, local taxes, concession fees and non-recurring operating expenses.

**Amortization of fixed assets**

Under IFRIC 12, we record the capital cost of developing and constructing parking structures and installing
parking meters under concession contracts as intangible assets on our balance sheet. Amortization expenses
primarily include the amortization of these capital costs over the term of the concession agreement on a straight
line basis. It also includes amortization on equipment and other tangible assets accounted for using the straight
line method over the estimated useful life of the asset. To the extent an agreement is terminated early, we write
off any remaining cost of capital on our balance sheet.

**Provisions and loss through unrecoverable receivables**

Provisions and loss through unrecoverable receivables consists of expenses that we reserve for in the relevant
estimated amount to take account of the potential insolvency of our customers. In general, we do not make
provision for municipalities or other public bodies with which we do business. For private bodies, we make
provision within 90 to 180 days after the due date for collection and do so on a case by case basis with the
relevant contract manager.

**Impairment and result through disposal of fixed assets**

Impairment and result through disposal of fixed assets primarily consists of gains or losses on the sale of
concessions or parking facilities. It also includes any asset impairment charges made at the end of each year to
reduce the holding value of assets to recoverable value, if lower. The recoverable value is the lower of the market
value and the value in use of the asset.

**Financial result**

Financial result comprises financial profit or loss primarily attributable to interest expense on our debt and any
interest income we receive, usually from cash held at banks. It also includes hedging profits or loss from our
hedging instruments. During the period under review, our hedging comprised interest rate swaps on our variable
rate debt.

**Share in results of equity-consolidated companies**

Share in results of equity-consolidated companies consists of our proportionate share of the income from
companies in which we hold minority interests. We generally hold minority interests in companies when necessary


-----

to obtain concessions where the municipalities have required that the controlling interest be held by the
municipality.
**Corporate income tax**

We recognize corporate income tax on our income statement both for amounts payable in the current year and
any applicable deferred tax attributable to the current year. In past years, we have accumulated significant tax
credits from our large capital expenditure program, which we expect to reduce our taxes payable on a cash basis
in future years.

**Results attributed to minority interests**

Results attributed to minority interests consists of the proportionate share of the income attributable to third
parties holding a minority interest in the relevant Group company.

**EBITDA**

We define EBITDA as consolidated results from ordinary operations excluding corporate income tax, financial
result, amortization of fixed assets and provisions and losses through unrecoverable receivables. EBITDA is a
non-IFRS measure that we use to evaluate our operating and financial performance and should not be considered
as an alternative measure to accounting measures under IFRS. See “Presentation of Financial and Other
_Information”._

**Adjusted EBITDA**

We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted for (i) non-recurring headquarter operating expenses (including
redundancy payments and other related personnel costs), (ii) non-recurring business unit expenses and (iii) other
“one off” or non-recurring gains and losses (including gains and losses realized from the sale of parking spaces to
local residents and gains and losses realized on the sale of parking facilities). Adjusted EBITDA is a non-IFRS
measure that we use to evaluate our operating and financial performance and should not be considered as an
alternative measure to accounting measures under IFRS. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information”.

**Adjusted EBITDA by business line**

We define Adjusted EBITDA by business line as the EBITDA for the relevant business line adjusted for (i)
reallocation of overhead costs and non-recurring headquarter operating expenses, (ii) non-recurring business unit
expenses (including redundancy payments and other related personnel costs) and (iii) other “one off” or nonrecurring gains and losses (including gains and losses realized from the sale of parking spaces to local residents
and gains and losses realized on the sale of parking facilities).

**_Net turnover_**

Our net turnover decreased by 2.4% from €136.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2012 to
€132.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013, primarily as a result of the expiration of certain
concessions, which were not renewed, including our Recoletos off-street concession in Madrid, our Montañeta
off-street concession in Alicante and our Estaçao de Oriente off-street concession in Lisbon.

**_Other operating income_**

Other operating income decreased by 14.3% from €2.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2012 to
€1.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013, primarily as a result of a decrease in the sale of
products and services through the amenities we make available to our customers within our parking facilities. In
addition, we received an indemnity payment of €0.8 million in 2012 in connection with the early termination of our
concession in Cascais, Portugal by the relevant municipality before the end of its term.

**_Adjusted Revenue_**

Our Adjusted Revenue decreased by 2.6% from €137.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2012 to
€134.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013, primarily as a result of a decrease in Adjusted
Revenue in our off-street concession business, partially offset by an increase in Adjusted Revenue in our onstreet concession business. Adjusted Revenue from our off-street concession business decreased by 6.8%
primarily as a result of the expiration of certain concessions reaching the end of their term, including our
Recoletos off-street concession in Madrid, our Montañeta off-street concession in Alicante and our Estaçao de
Oriente off-street concession in Lisbon. This decrease was partially offset by Adjusted Revenue generated by two
new parking facilities. Adjusted Revenue from our on-street concession business increased by 1.8% primarily as
a result of the operation of new concessions, including our concessions in Almería (which is currently in the “ramp
up” phase) and Empuries, as well as the expansion of our concession in Pamplona to cover additional parking
spaces. Adjusted Revenue from our off-street contract management business remained relatively stable for the
nine months ended September 30, 2013 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2012.
**_Variation in stock of finished products and products in process_**

Variation in stock of finished products and products in process decreased by 50.0% from €0.2 million in the nine
months ended September 30, 2012 to €0.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013.

**_Supplies_**


-----

Supplies increased by 50.0% from €0.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2012 to €0.6 million in
the nine months ended September 30, 2013, primarily as a result of an increase in the purchase of tickets for our
automated ticket machines and other materials.

**_Personnel costs_**

Our personnel costs decreased by 5.3% from €58.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2012 to
€55.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013, primarily as a result of the restructuring of our
workforce undertaken at the end of 2012 and the implementation of measures designed to centralize the
management and control of our parking facilities which resulted in a reductions in our employee headcount.

**_Other operating expenses_**

Other operating expenses decreased by 8.0% from €34.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2012
to €32.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013, primarily as a result of the cost savings program
we implemented in 2012 to optimize both our operating expenses and overhead costs. For example, as a result of
our implementation of measures to centralize the management and control of our parking facilities, we were able
to reduce our reliance on external service providers by reallocating personnel to perform certain functions
previously performed by third party service providers. The following table shows the components of other
operating expenses for the relevant periods.

**Nine months ended September 30**

**(€ in millions)** **2012** **2013**

External services ................................................................................. 32.3 29.5
Taxes ................................................................................................... 2.1 2.2

Other non-recurrent operating expenses ............................................ 0.1 0.2

**Total** ................................................................................................ **34.9** **32.1**

**_Amortization of fixed assets_**

Amortization of fixed assets decreased by 3.2% from €22.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2012
to €21.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013, primarily as a result of the expiration of certain
concessions, including our Recoletos off-street concession in Madrid, our Montañeta off-street concession in
Alicante and our Estaçao de Oriente off-street concession in Lisbon.

**_Provisions and loss through unrecoverable receivables_**

Provisions and loss through unrecoverable receivables decreased by 10% from €1.0 million in the nine months
ended September 30, 2012 to €0.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013, primarily as a result of
a reduction in the level of potential customer insolvencies.

**_Impairment and result through disposal of fixed assets_**

Impairment and result through disposal of fixed assets increased from nil in the nine months ended
September 30, 2012 to €48,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2013.
**_Financial result_**

Financial expense decreased by 4.8% from €29.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2012 to
€27.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013, primarily due to lower interest expense as a result of
a decrease in the rate of EURIBOR during the period, which is used to calculate the rate of interest payable under
our Existing Credit Facilities and local credit facilities.

**_Share in results of equity-consolidated companies_**

Share in results of equity-consolidated companies decreased by 33.3% from €1.2 million in the nine months
ended September 30, 2012 to €0.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013, primarily as a result of
a decrease in the result of entities in which we hold a minority equity interest, particularly SMASSA, in the nine
months ended September 30, 2013.


-----

**_Corporate income tax_**

Corporate income tax decreased by 38.9% from €1.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2012 to
€1.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013, driven primarily by the decrease in our result for the
period.

**_Results attributed to minority interests_**

Losses attributed to minority interests increased from €20,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2012 to
€0.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013, primarily as a result of an increase in the result of
companies within the Group in which third parties hold a minority interest.

**_EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA_**

Our EBITDA increased by 4.5% from €44.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2012 to €46.4 million
in the nine months ended September 30, 2013, primarily as a result of a decrease in our personnel costs and
other operating expenses. Adjusted EBITDA decreased by 3.7% from €48.9 million in the nine months ended
September 30, 2012 to €47.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013, primarily as a result of the
expiration of certain concessions reaching the end of their term, including our Recoletos off-street concession in
Madrid, our Montañeta off-street concession in Alicante and our Estaçao de Oriente off-street concession in
Lisbon. This decrease was partially offset by Adjusted EBITDA generated by two new parking facilities.

**_Year ended December 31, 2012 compared to year ended December 31, 2011_**

The following table shows our net turnover, Adjusted Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA, by business line, in each
case for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2012.

**Total ...............................................................................................** **64.3** **64.2** **(0.2)%**

**_Net turnover_**

Our net turnover decreased by 15.0% from €212.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 to €180.9 million
in the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily as a result of a significant decrease in the sale of parking spaces
to local residents in the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the year ended December 31, 2011. In the
year ended December 31, 2012, sales of parking spaces to local residents generated net turnover of €0.3 million,
as compared to €26.9 million generated in the prior year. Our net turnover for the year ended December 31, 2012
was also adversely impacted by the early termination of our concession in Cascais, Portugal by the relevant
municipality in 2011 before the end of its term. This concession accounted for 0.5% of our net turnover in 2010.

**_Other operating income_**

Other operating income increased by 50.0% from €2.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 to
€3.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily as a result of an indemnity payment of €0.8 million in
2012 in connection with the early termination of our concession in Cascais, Portugal by the relevant municipality
before the end of its term.

**_Adjusted Revenue_**


-----

Our Adjusted Revenue decreased by 2.1% from €187.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 to
€183.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily as a result of a decrease in Adjusted Revenue in
our off-street concession business. Adjusted Revenue from our off-street concession business decreased by
4.6% primarily as a result of a slight reduction in volumes. Adjusted Revenue from both our on-street concession
and off-street contract management businesses remained generally stable for the year ended December 31, 2012
compared to the year ended December 31, 2011.

**_Variation in stock of finished products and products in process_**

Variation in stock of finished products and products in process decreased from €18.4 million in the year ended
December 31, 2011 to €0.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2012. This variation was primarily attributable
to the sale of parking spaces to local residents in our new parking facilities at Plaza de Cataluña and La Concha
in San Sebastián in 2011.

**_Supplies_**

Supplies decreased by 20.0% from €1.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 to €0.8 million in the year
ended December 31, 2012, primarily as a result of a decrease in the purchase of tickets for our automated
machines and other materials.

**_Personnel costs_**

Our personnel costs increased by 5.9% from €74.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 to €79.0 million
in the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily as a result of redundancy payments made in connection with a
restructuring of our workforce undertaken at the end of 2012.

**_Other operating expenses_**

Other operating expenses decreased by 7.2% from €51.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 to
€47.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily as a result of the cost savings program we
implemented in 2012 to optimize both our operating expenses and overhead costs. For example, as a result of
our implementation of measures to centralize the management and control of our parking facilities, we were able
to reduce our reliance on external service providers by reallocating personnel to perform certain functions
previously performed by third party service providers. The following table shows the components of other
operating expenses for the relevant periods.

**Year ended December 31**

**(€ in millions)** **2011** **2012**

External services .............................................................................................. 44.9 42.6
Taxes ................................................................................................................ 2.9 2.8
Other operating expenses ................................................................................ 0.2 0.4
Other non-recurrent operating expenses ......................................................... 3.3 1.8

**Total** ............................................................................................................. **51.3** **47.6**

**_Amortization of fixed assets_**

Amortization of fixed assets increased from €29.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 to €29.5 million in
the year ended December 31, 2012.

**_Provisions and loss through unrecoverable receivables_**

Provisions and loss through unrecoverable receivables decreased by 10.0% from €2.0 million in the year ended
December 31, 2011 to €1.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily as a result of a reduction in
the level of potential customer insolvencies.

**_Impairment and result through disposal of fixed assets_**

Impairment and result through disposal of fixed assets was €8,000 for the year ended December 31, 2012,
compared to nil for the year ended December 31, 2011.


-----

**_Financial result_**

Financial expense decreased by 1.5% from €38.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 to €38.3 million in
the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily due to lower interest expense as a result of a decrease in the rate
of EURIBOR during the period, which is used to calculate the rate of interest payable under our Existing Credit
Facilities and local credit facilities.

**_Share in results of equity-consolidated companies_**

Share in results of equity-consolidated companies decreased by 41.7% from €1.2 million in the year ended
December 31, 2011 to €0.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily as a result of a decrease in
the result of entities in which we hold a minority equity interest, particularly SMASSA, in the year ended
December 31, 2012.

**_Corporate income tax_**

Corporate income tax decreased by 47.0% from €5.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 to €2.7 million
in the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily driven by the decrease in our overall result for 2012 and the
significant deductions made in connection with our investments in fixed assets in 2011 as part of our capital
program.

**_Results attributed to minority interests_**

Results attributed to minority interests increased from a loss of €4.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2011
to a gain of €0.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily as a result of a decrease in the result of
companies within the Group in which third parties hold a minority interest.
**_EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA_**

Our EBITDA decreased by 19.2% from €69.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 to €56.5 million in the
year ended December 31, 2012, primarily due to the fact that a higher amount of net turnover was generated by
sales of parking spaces to local residents in 2011 as part of our capital program, as compared to the year ended
December 31, 2012, in which significantly fewer parking space sales were made. Adjusted EBITDA remained
generally stable for the year ended December 31, 2012 at €64.2 million, as compared to €64.3 million in the year
ended December 31, 2011.

**Year ended December 31, 2011 compared to year ended December 31, 2010**

The following table shows our net turnover, Adjusted Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA, by business line, in each
case for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2011.

**Year ended December 31**

**Total ...............................................................................................................** **60.3** **64.3** **6.6%**

**_Net turnover_**

Our net turnover increased by 4.2% from €204.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2010 to €212.9 million in
the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily as a result of an increase in the sale of parking spaces to local
residents in the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. In the year


-----

ended December 31, 2011 such sales of parking spaces to local residents generated net turnover of €26.9 million
compared to €20.4 million generated in the previous year.

**_Other operating income_**

Other operating income decreased by 24.1% from €2.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2010 to
€2.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily due to the fact that the subsidy we received from the
relevant municipality in connection with our concession in Avilés for the year ended December 31, 2010 no longer
applied in respect of the year ended December 31, 2011.

**_Adjusted Revenue_**

Our Adjusted Revenue increased by 1.4% from €185.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2010 to
€187.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily as a result of an increase in Adjusted Revenue in
our off-street concession business and our off-street contract management business, partially offset by a
decrease in Adjusted Revenue in our on-street concession business. Adjusted Revenue from our off-street
concession business increased by 1.3% primarily as a result of the commencement of new concessions at Plaza
de Cataluña and La Concha in San Sebastián. Adjusted Revenue from our on-street concession business
decreased by 1.6% primarily as a result of our concession in Zaragoza reaching the end of its term. Adjusted
Revenue from our off-street contract management business increased by 13.2% from €19.7 million in 2010 to
€22.3 million in 2011, primarily driven by the increase in net turnover generated by our UK business as a result of
our winning the contract to manage parking at Edinburgh Airport.

**_Variation in stock of finished products and products in process_**

Variation in stock of finished products and products in process increased by 30.5% from €14.1 million in the year
ended December 31, 2010 to €18.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily as a result of the sale
of parking spaces to local residents in our new parking facilities at Plaza de Cataluña and La Concha in San
Sebastián in 2011.

**_Supplies_**

Supplies decreased by 41.2% from €1.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2010 to €1.0 million in the year
ended December 31, 2011, primarily as a result of a decrease in the purchase of tickets for our automated ticket
machines and other materials.

**_Personnel costs_**

Our personnel costs increased by 1.5% from €73.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2010 to €74.6 million
in the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily as a result of an increase in salaries for employees in Spain and
Portugal in accordance with the consumer price index.

**_Other operating expenses_**

Other operating expenses increased by 3.2% from €49.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2010 to
€51.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily as a result of an increase in our external services
driven by the opening of our new parking facilities at Plaza de Cataluña and La Concha in San Sebastián. The
following table shows the components of other operating expenses for the relevant periods.

**Year ended December 31**

**(€ in millions)** **2010** **2011**

External services .............................................................................................. 38.3 44.9
Taxes ................................................................................................................ 4.4 2.9

**Total** ............................................................................................................. **49.7** **51.3**

(1) In the year ended December 31, 2011, we incurred €1.8 million in non-recurring fees and expenses in connection with a financing transaction.

**_Amortization of fixed assets_**


-----

Amortization of fixed assets increased by 12.6% from €26.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2010 to
€29.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily as a result of the application of a new accounting
regulation IFRIC 12 in 2011, pursuant to which the capital cost of constructing parking structures and installing
parking meters was no longer recorded as an expense in the profit and loss account, but amortized over the term
of the concession on a straight line basis.
**_Provisions and loss through unrecoverable receivables_**

Provisions and loss through unrecoverable receivables increased by 42.9% from €1.4 million in the year ended
December 31, 2010 to €2.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily as a result of an increase in
the level of potential customer insolvencies and delays in payment on our outstanding receivables. In addition, we
recorded an expense of €0.2 million in 2011 in connection with the insolvency of Spanair.

**_Impairment and result through disposal of fixed assets_**

Impairment and result through disposal of fixed assets for the year ended December 31, 2010 was €4.1 million,
as compared to nil for the year ended December 31, 2011. This change can be attributed primarily to the gains
realized with respect to the sale of our hospital parking facility in Pamplona.

**_Financial result_**

Financial losses increased by 14.1% from €34.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2010 to €38.9 million in
the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily as a result of an increase in our outstanding debt under our Existing
Credit Facilities and Project Finance Facilities, as well as the introduction of a new accounting regulation IFRIC 12
in 2011, which requires us to account for the future fee payments we are required to make to a municipality under
the relevant concession as debt, resulting in an interest expense in connection therewith.

**_Share in results of equity-consolidated companies_**

Share in results of equity-consolidated companies increased by 9.1% from €1.1 million in the year ended
December 31, 2010 to €1.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily as a result of an increase in
the result of entities in which we hold a minority equity interest.

**_Corporate income tax_**

We had corporate income tax of €1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. We had a corporate income
tax benefit of €5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. This change was primarily driven by our overall
result for the year and the significant deductions made in connection with our investments in fixed assets in 2011
as part of our capital program.

**_Results attributed to minority interests_**

Losses attributed to minority interests increased by 72.0% from a loss of €2.5 million in the year ended
December 31, 2010 to a loss of €4.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily as a result of an
increase in the result of companies within the Group in which third parties hold a minority interest due to the sale
of parking spaces to local residents (mainly in our new parking facilities at Plaza de Cataluña and La Concha in
San Sebastián).

**_EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA_**

Our EBITDA decreased by 3.3% from €72.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2010 to €69.9 million in the
year ended December 31, 2011, primarily as a result of the sale of our hospital parking facility in Pamplona in
2010. Adjusted EBITDA increased by 6.6% from €60.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2010 to
€64.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily as a result of the commencement of new
concessions at Plaza de Cataluña and La Concha in San Sebastián.
**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

We had cash and other equivalent liquid assets of €23.9 million as of September 30, 2013, compared to
€28.0 million as of September 30, 2012. As of September 30, 2013, after giving pro forma effect to the
Refinancing, our cash and other equivalent liquid assets would have been €11.2 million.

The following table shows our statement of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012
and for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 and 2013.

Cash flows from financing activities............................. 24.6 35.5 (21.9) (15.9) (6.1)

**Cash flows from operating activities**

Our on-street concession business generally requires greater working capital, due to the dynamics associated
with the payment of receivables from municipalities under the relevant concessions. Our off-street concession
business generally requires less working capital, due to the immediate collection of tariffs from car park users (if
they do not pay then they cannot exit the car park) and the receipt of payment for season tickets in advance.
Generally, our working capital is fairly stable with minimal effects from seasonality.

We seek to maintain a business model that enjoys negative working capital primarily as a result of the direct
payments we receive from end users of our off-street parking facilities. However, in the year ended December 31,
2011, we experienced an increase in working capital of €41.5 million as a result of two primary factors. Firstly, our
cash flow was impacted by delays in payment by certain municipalities in Spain, which payments amounted to
€14.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 and arose solely with respect to our on-street concession
business. The municipalities in question made the necessary payments under the concessions eventually and
none entered bankruptcy. However, certain of our private counterparties have entered bankruptcy in the past,
including Spanair. In addition, in 2011 we were nearing the end of our capital program, which involved the
construction of eight large parking facilities. Accordingly, we made payments in 2011 to our various construction
contractors and suppliers under the program, and also sold a large number of parking spaces within our new
parking facilities to local residents. As a result of all the above factors, our cash flow from operations was
impacted and our working capital increased. However, in 2012, the Spanish government implemented a number
of initiatives to reduce payment delays by the various municipalities with respect to concessionaires. Furthermore,
we have since completed our capital program and do not expect to make any additional significant expansionary
capital expenditure or sell a significant number of parking spaces to local residents in connection therewith in the
near future. As a result, we have improved our working capital management, as demonstrated by a decrease in
working capital between December 31, 2012 and September 30, 2013.
The following table sets forth a reconciliation of our result for the financial year before tax to cash flows from
operating activities for each of the years ended December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012 and the nine months ended
September 30, 2012 and 2013.

**Cash flows from operating activities.............................** **41.7** **(11.1)** **18.1** **26.6** **28.2**

For the nine months ended September 30, 2013, our cash flows from operating activities consisted of a cash
inflow of €28.2 million, driven primarily by adjusting amortizations and provisions of €22.3 million on the negative
result for the first nine months of the year before tax of €2.9 million and, to a lesser extent, by a decrease in
debtors and other accounts receivable of €7.0 million. Working capital decreased by €6.5 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2013, driven primarily by a decrease in debtors and other accounts receivable. The
decrease in stock in the amount of €0.1 million was primarily due to a decrease in the sale of parking spaces to
local residents. The decrease in debtors and other accounts receivable in the amount of €7.0 million was primarily
a result of the payment by municipalities of fees under our concessions. The decrease in creditors and other
accounts payable in the amount of €6.3 million was primarily due to our purchase of our new Mazarredo parking
facility in Bilbao, a final payment to the relevant contractor in connection with the construction of our Sancho Ávila
parking facility in Barcelona and, to a lesser extent, the payment of a waiver fee under our Existing Credit
Facilities.

For the year ended December 31, 2012, our cash flows from operating activities consisted of a cash inflow of
€18.1 million, driven primarily by adjusting amortizations and provisions of €31.2 million on the negative result for
the year before tax of €12.4 million. Working capital decreased by €2.5 million for the year ended December 31,
2012, driven primarily by (i) an increase in stock in the amount of €3.5 million, related to parking spaces in our
Mazarredo parking facility in Bilbao and our Passeig Nou parking facility in Barcelona, (ii) a decrease in debtors
and other accounts receivable in the amount of €3.9 million, primarily as a result of improvements in timing for
payments from municipalities in our on-street concession business, and (iii) an increase in creditors and other
accounts payable in the amount of €0.8 million.
For the year ended December 31, 2011, our cash flows from operating activities consisted of a cash outflow of
€11.1 million, driven primarily by pre-tax results of €0.8 million, increased by €29.4 million for amortization of fixed
assets and an increase in working capital in the amount of €41.5 million. Working capital increased by
€41.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, driven primarily by an increase in debtors and other
accounts receivable and a decrease in creditors and other accounts payable. The increase in the balance of
debtors and other accounts receivable in the amount of €20.4 million was driven primarily by the significant
increase in the sale of parking spaces to local residents during that year (mainly in our new parking facilities at
Plaza de Cataluña and La Concha in San Sebastián), as well as an increase in the balance of receivables in our
on-street concession business during the year. The decrease in the balance of creditors and other accounts
payable in the amount of €23.8 million driven was driven primarily by (i) the significant increase in the sale of
parking spaces to local residents during that year (mainly in our new parking facilities at Plaza de Cataluña and
La Concha in San Sebastián) for which we received payment from our customers upfront and the proceeds of
which we were, in turn, able to apply towards the cost of construction for the relevant facilities and (ii) to a lesser
extent, the payment to municipalities of concession fees at Plaza de Cataluña and La Concha.

For the year ended December 31, 2010, our cash flows from operating activities consisted of a cash inflow of
€41.7 million, driven primarily by pre-tax results of €11.9 million, increased by €26.9 million for amortization of
fixed assets and a decrease in working capital in the amount of €2.9 million. Working capital decreased by
€2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, driven primarily by (i) a decrease in debtors and other
accounts receivable in the amount of €3.1 million, mainly in connection with a decrease in amounts due from tax
authorities when we changed from quarterly to monthly VAT filings, and (ii) an increase in creditors and other
accounts payable in the amount of €2.5 million in connection with the payment of concession fees due to the
relevant municipalities in 2011 with respect to our new parking facilities at Plaza de Cataluña and La Concha in
San Sebastián, partially offset by a decrease of €2.9 million in other current liabilities.

**Cash flows from investment activities**


-----

We invested an aggregate of €124.6 million in car parks between 2010 and September 30, 2013. Specifically, we
invested €65.3 million, €35.9 million and €11.4 million in the years ended December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012,
respectively, and €12.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013. As of September 30, 2013, we had
approximately €6.3 million in outstanding capital commitments for constructing new car parks, of which we expect
to invest approximately €2.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 and the remainder in 2014.

The following table sets forth our capital expenditure for the periods indicated:

**Nine**

**months ended**

**Year ended December 31** **September 30**

**(€ in millions)** **2010** **2011** **2012** **2012** **2013**

**Total..................................................................................** **65.4** **52.2** **11.4** **11.3** **12.0**

During the nine months ended September 30, 2013, our main investment activities related to the following parking
facilities:

- Baixa Chiado: €3.6 million in connection with the acquisition of an off-street parking facility in Lisbon, which has
been completed and is fully operational;

- Alves Redol: €1.7 million in connection with the construction of an off-street parking facility in Lisbon, which has
been completed and is fully operational;

- Don Luis I: €0.6 million in connection with the construction of an off-street parking facility in Portugal, which we
expect to be completed in the first half of 2014;

- Ponferrada: €0.5 million in connection with an on-street concession in Northern Spain, which is fully
operational; and

- Pamplona: €0.3 million in connection with an on-street concession in Northern Spain, which is fully operational.

In 2012, we successfully completed the capital program initiated by our prior parent company in 2009, which
involved the construction of eight large parking facilities and a total capital expenditure for the period 2010 to 2012
of approximately €81.5 million. As a result of this program, we believe we are now a well invested company and
we therefore do not expect to make any additional significant expansionary capital expenditure in the near future.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2013, our cash flows from investment activities consisted of a cash
outflow of €11.9 million, driven primarily by investments made in on-street and off-street concessions, which
investment activities are described above.


-----

For the year ended December 31, 2012, our cash flows from investment activities consisted of a cash outflow of
€10.6 million, driven primarily by investments in: (i) our Passeig Nou parking facility in the amount of €1.2 million,
(ii) our parking facility in Voramar in the amount of €1.3 million, (iii) our Alves Redol parking facility in the amount
of €1.2 million, (iv) our Sancho de Avila parking facility in the amount of €0.7 million and (v) our on-street
concession in Almería in the amount of €0.8 million, all of which have been completed and are fully operational.

For the year ended December 31, 2011, our cash flows from investment activities consisted of a cash outflow of
€35.0 million, driven primarily by investments in: (i) our parking facility in San Agustin in the amount of
€14.9 million, (ii) our parking facility at Plaza de Cataluña in San Sebastián in the amount of €10.0 million and
(iii) our parking facility at La Concha in San Sebastián in the amount of €8.9 million, all of which have been
completed and are fully operational.

For the year ended December 31, 2010, our cash flows from investment activities consisted of a cash outflow of
€49.2 million, driven primarily by investments in: (i) new concessions at La Concha in San Sebastián in the
amount of €15.9 million, (ii) new concessions at Plaza de Cataluña in San Sebastián in the amount of €9.2 million,
(iii) new concessions at Oquendo in San Sebastián in the amount of €3.3 million and (iv) new concessions at
Centro Hospitalario in Pamplona in the amount of €7.3 million, with any remaining amount comprising capital
expenditure for maintenance and investments in renewed concessions. This was partially offset by gains of
€12.9 million realized from the sale of parking spaces at Oquendo in San Sebastián and €4.8 million realized from
the sale of our parking facility at Clínica Universitaria in Pamplona.
The following tables set forth a breakdown of our capital expenditure for the periods indicated, as adjusted to
exclude the effects of movements in financial assets and other items we do not normally consider to be capital
expenditure.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2013, our cash flows from financing activities consisted of a cash
outflow of €6.1 million, driven primarily by the repayment and servicing of outstanding debt in the amount of
€8.1 million.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2012, our cash flows from financing activities consisted of a cash
outflow of €15.9 million, driven primarily by the repayment and servicing of outstanding debt in the amount of
€19.1 million.

For the year ended December 31, 2012, our cash flows from financing activities consisted of a cash outflow of
€21.9 million, driven primarily by the repayment and servicing of outstanding debt in the amount of €21.9 million.

For the year ended December 31, 2011, our cash flows from financing activities consisted of a cash inflow of
€35.5 million, driven primarily by a drawdown of new debt in the amount of €62.9 million to finance capital
expenditure under our capital program in respect of our parking facilities in San Sebastián, which was partially
offset by the repayment and servicing of outstanding debt in the amount of €27.7 million.

For the year ended December 31, 2010, our cash flows from financing activities consisted of a cash inflow of
€24.6 million, primarily as a result of the borrowing of €27.5 million under our capital expenditure credit facility and
our Project Finance Facilities. This inflow was partially offset by an outflow of €3.4 million, which was lent on
behalf of our partners in our majority owned subsidiaries.

**Available liquidity**

Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and other equivalent liquid assets, cash flows from operations and
our short term credit lines. As of September 30, 2013, after giving pro forma effect to the Refinancing, we would
have had €6.3 million of availability under these credit lines and no material amounts outstanding. Following the
completion of the Offering, our short term facilities will be supplemented by our €30 million Revolving Credit
Facility, of which €22.5 million will be drawn as of the Issue Date. We expect to repay such amount using
proceeds received in connection with the Calle Sevilla Parking Facility Sale. See “Use of Proceeds”. As of
September 30, 2013, after giving pro forma effect to the Refinancing, our total indebtedness would have been
€515.5 million, consisting of €385.0 million outstanding under the Notes, €22.5 million outstanding under our
Revolving Credit Facility, €10.5 million outstanding under our capital leases, €4.6 million outstanding under our
local short term credit facilities and €92.9 million outstanding under our Project Finance Facilities. See
“Capitalization”. For further details with respect to our indebtedness, see “Description of Other Indebtedness” and
“Description of the Notes”.
**Project Finance Facilities**

One of the primary sources of financing for the construction and acquisition of new parking facilities by our nonwholly owned subsidiaries has been our Project Finance Facilities. The following table shows our Project Finance

(1) Empark owns 50% of the capital stock of Aparcamientos de Bilbao, S.A. and a Spanish law right of use (usufructo) over 25% of the capital stock
of the aforementioned company. As a result, Empark has a 75% economic interest in Aparcamientos de Bilbao, S.A.
(2) Represents amount outstanding including accrued interest and excluding unamortized debt issue costs.

**Other Concession Financing**

We also utilize capital leases as a source of financing for the construction of parking facilities. As of
September 30, 2013, we had 28 such leases outstanding, under which borrowings of €10.5 million were
outstanding, of which €9.3 million represents indebtedness of the Non-Recourse Entities. The outstanding amount
under our capital leases is capitalized over the term of the respective leases.
We extend performance bonds and guarantees provided by banks to local authorities for our performance under
our concessions agreements. The aggregate face amount outstanding under these performance bonds and
guarantees was €55.3 million as of September 30, 2013 and no amounts were drawn under such performance
bonds.

**Hedging transactions**


-----

Currently, we hedge our variable rate obligations through the use of interest rate swaps. As of September 30,
2013, we had swaps in place to hedge outstanding debt obligations in the amount of €284.5 million under our
Existing Credit Facilities and Project Finance Facilities. We intend to unwind and terminate our outstanding
interest rate swaps that we previously entered into in connection with our Existing Credit Facilities.

**Cash collections**

As a result of day-to-day activity at our parking locations, we collect significant amounts of cash. For our off-street
concessions, we collect cash in advance for hourly, daily and monthly charges, and use a portion of this to pay
the fees to the concession owners. For our on-street concessions, we generally collect cash daily at the time of
service, with the cash in excess of our fees remitted to the municipalities at fixed intervals. For our off-street
contract management business, we collect the cash from users and net it against payments owed from the facility
owners and pay the remainder to the facility owners as required under the contract. Some municipalities and
other clients require us to deposit the cash receipts into client accounts and the clients then reimburse us for our
fees.

**Contractual obligations**

(1) Represents non-recourse project financing arrangements entered into by certain of our non-wholly owned subsidiaries to finance the construction
of parking infrastructure under concession contracts. “Non-recourse” means that the lenders under the facilities have recourse only against the
subsidiary that is the borrower under the arrangement (and its assets and, in some cases, its capital stock), and not to other members of the
Group.
(2) Represents capital lease (or finance lease) obligations entered into to finance the construction of parking facilities, among other things.
(3) Does not include borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, which borrowings may be drawn, repaid and redrawn at any time. We intend to
draw €22.5 million under the Revolving Credit Facility on the Issue Date, which we expect to repay using proceeds received in connection with the
Calle Sevilla Parking Facility Sale. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Revolving Credit Facility Agreement”.
(4) Relates principally to outstanding capital commitments for the construction of new parking facilities.
We are required to pay annual concessionary fees to municipalities under many of our concessions. Fixed fees
paid to municipalities in the year ended December 31, 2012 amounted to €3.2 million.

**Off balance sheet arrangements**

Aside from the performance bonds, guarantees and operating leases described above and any non-recourse
factoring that we may undertake from time to time, we do not utilize any forms of off balance sheet arrangements.

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk**

**Interest rate risk**

Our primary market risk exposure consists of risks related to changes in interest rates. The Floating Rate Notes,
the Revolving Credit Facility and most of our local credit facilities bear interest at variable rates. This exposes us


-----

to fluctuations or variability in interest payments due to changes in interest rates. If interest rates increase, our
interest expense will also increase, and conversely, if interest rates decrease, our interest expense will also
decrease. Additionally, increases in interest rates would cause financing to be more expensive for future projects
and acquisitions and would increase the cost of our short-term debt. Currently, we hedge our variable rate
obligations through the use of interest rate swaps. We intend to unwind and terminate our outstanding interest
rate swaps that we previously entered into in connection with our Existing Credit Facilities. We may decide to
undertake hedging with respect to the Floating Rate Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility or any other variable rate
obligations we may have outstanding in the future.

**Foreign currency risk**

We are exposed to foreign currency risk on those transactions or assets and liabilities that are in a currency other
than our reporting currency, the Euro. This exposure is currently limited in our business, with our primary foreign
currency exposures relating to the British pound and the Turkish lira. For the year ended December 31, 2012, our
operations in the United Kingdom and Turkey amounted to 3.9% and 2.1% of our net turnover, respectively.

**Liquidity risk**

Liquidity risk is the risk of not being able to fulfill present or future obligations if we do not have sufficient funds
available to meet such obligations. Liquidity risk arises mostly in relation to cash flows generated and used in
financing activities, and particularly by servicing our debt, in terms of both interest and capital, and our payment
obligations relating to our ordinary business activities.

We believe that the potential risks to our liquidity include:

- a reduction in operating cash flows due to a lowering of net turnover from our operations, which could be due
to downturns in our performance or the industry as a whole;

- adverse working capital developments; and

- exposure to increased interest rates in relation to our borrowings that bear interest at a variable rate, including
our Floating Rate Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility.

If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources (including borrowings under the Revolving
Credit Facility) are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be
forced to:

- reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditures;

- reduce or delay our planned acquisitions;

- sell assets;

- obtain additional debt or equity capital; or

- restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity.

We cannot assure you that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on
satisfactory terms, if at all. In addition, the terms of our debt, including the Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility,
limit our ability to pursue these alternatives, as may the terms of any future debt.

**Critical Accounting Policies**

This “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” discusses our
consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS. Accounting estimates are
an integral part of the preparation of the financial statements and the financial reporting process and are based
upon current judgments. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reported period. Certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their
complexity and the possibility that future events affecting them may differ materially from our current judgments
and estimates.


-----

This listing of critical accounting policies is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all our accounting policies.
In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by IFRS, with no need
for management’s judgment regarding accounting policy. We believe that of our significant accounting policies,
the following policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity.

**Revenue and cost recognition**

We recognize revenue when it can be reliably valued and it is probable that we will receive the funds. In the case
of our off-street concession business, this occurs when we receive fees from our clients, which are recognized on
an accrual basis for season ticket holders. In the case of our on-street concession business and off-street contract
management business, revenue is recognized at the time the service is provided based on the set fee we are
entitled to receive plus, in most cases, the incentive payment, which is based on the funds collected. We must
make a calculation in order to determine the amount of revenue earned as an incentive payment, and sometimes
we also need to determine if and how to allocate certain costs, which can involve judgment on the part of
management.

When we sell off-street parking spaces, we recognize both expenses and revenues at the time of delivery, which
is generally when the contract is signed. This requires us to allocate costs of a particular project to the space at
such time. Generally, we allocate costs by allocating the construction cost associated with the parking spaces
sold. We perform this allocation based on an engineering report prepared by an external advisor.

**Impairment of goodwill**

We perform a yearly impairment test to identify any instances where book value is greater than the recoverable
value of goodwill. Since our goodwill consists of individual car parks acquired upon prior acquisitions, we calculate
impairment by comparing the value of these assets with fair value. Typically fair value is based on the price at
which the asset could be sold, but since there is often no relevant market comparison, especially for concessions,
we typically use a discounted future cash flow model in this analysis. This model requires us to make
assumptions about estimated future cash flow, the risk-free discount rate, the risk of the asset and market
premium. Additionally, we include in our model an estimate of any residual value based on renewal of the contract
and growth. If any discrepancies are identified in the course of our annual impairment testing, we write-down book
value to the fair value of the asset.

**Taxes**

We recognize income taxes based on both the current taxes and any deferred taxes that relate to the current
period. Due to differences in depreciation and other accounting policies used in determining our income taxes, our
tax payments often occur in a different period than the period in which profits are recognized for accounting
purposes. We recognize assets or liabilities for amounts expected to be paid or recovered from tax authorities. In
making these determinations we only recognize tax assets to the extent that we believe there will be future
taxable profits which could be used to compensate for temporary differences. For these purposes, we must make
calculations relating to when expense items will be recognized for tax purposes and whether our future income
will be sufficient to allow us to use such deductions and tax credits recognized as assets.

**Introduction**

Parking plays a pivotal role in transportation, building design, quality of life and environmental issues. Generally,
the parking infrastructure and management business, and in particular the concession-based portion of the
industry, has lower demand risk and limited direct competition. Additionally, the industry benefits from a degree of
regulatory protection and stability because it provides a critical service to municipalities. The number of car
parking spaces has been growing in Iberia mainly as a result of the increase in urbanization and an increase in
the number of cars. The profitability of the sector is generally improving, supported by the efficient implementation
of cost savings programs and the utilization of innovative industry technology, among other factors.

**Market segmentation**

The car park industry can be divided into three general categories:

- _Off-street concessions: Consists of parking in purpose-built facilities which can be located on private land or,_
more commonly, commissioned by the local authority on public land as part of its urban planning activities.
Users can rent car park spaces by the minute, hour, day, week, month or year. Parking spaces may also be
sold to local residents for a single lump-sum payment. Concessions are awarded via a public tender process
and often require the winning party to build or upgrade a parking facility. Given the required initial capital
investment, off-street concessions generally have longer terms than on-street concessions, typically up to 40 or
50 years, depending on the type of contract. A concession agreement regulates the tariff which can be charged
by the concessionaire, which is linked to inflation or another agreed formula.

- _On-street concessions: Consists of parking in dedicated parking bays located “on the street”. As part of its_
urban planning activities, municipalities will identify parking zones which are reserved for local residents, zones
available for general parking and zones for mixed use. Municipalities limit the area of on-street car parking and
generally outsource the management and enforcement of on-street parking to specialized firms via a public
tender process. If a concessionaire wins a public tender for an on-street concession, it normally will not face
any competition for that concession until the concession agreement expires and a new awardee starts to
operate the service. On-street concession length typically runs between 5 and 20 years and are typically
structured either on a “cost plus fee” basis with low demand risk, or on a basis where the concessionaire pays
an up-front fee to the municipality but retains all the on-street revenue and therefore bears demand risk.

- _Off-street contract management: Off-street contract management activities consist of private or public entities_
outsourcing the day-to-day management of off-street parking facilities. These contracts tend to have more
variable terms than concessions and generally are for shorter terms. Additionally, the bidding process for these
contracts is more competitive and, as a result, margins on these contracts tend to be lower than with
concessions. Off-street contract management arrangements with private entities are typically structured so that
the parking operator pays an annual rental charge to the parking infrastructure owner and in return retains all
the revenue, effectively bearing all the demand risk. Contracts with public or quasi-public entities typically carry
less demand risk because the operator’s compensation is primarily an annual inflation linked fee for managing
the parking operation.

The off-street concession business is Empark’s largest business line, representing 46.3% of the Adjusted
Revenue and 78.6% of Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended September 30, 2013. The on-street


-----

concession and the off-street contract management represented 41.1% and 12.6% of the Adjusted Revenues and
22.1% and (0.6)% of the Adjusted EBITDA in the twelve months ended September 30, 2013, respectively.

**Business models**

The major off-street car park companies mainly operate under one of two separate businesses:

- _Concessionaire : Under the concessionaire model, the operator constructs the facility which is referred to as_
“green field” concession or pays a fee to the municipality for an existing facility which is referred to as “brown
_field” concession and enters into an agreement with the municipality for the exclusive right to operate, maintain_
and invest in car parking activities for a given number of years. The concessionaire generally pays an upfront
fixed sum or an annual fee (which can be fixed and/or be based on a percentage of revenue) to the
municipalities.

- _Car park operator: Under the car park operator model, the operator enters into a contract management_
arrangement with a private client to operate the parking facility. Typically, the operator collects the revenues
generated from users and pays the client a fixed fee or a fee plus a percentage of revenues. Therefore, the
operator retains most of the demand risk, which can result in lower revenues and margins during economic
downturns, because in many cases parking facilities owned by private clients are not located in as favorable
locations as facilities developed by municipalities and other public authorities.

These two business models have significant differences, with the concessionaire model generally requiring an
initial investment in exchange for concessions with higher margins, longer terms and generally lower levels of
demand risk. The car park operator business model is subject to more intense competition due to lower barriers to
entry and short contract duration. We operate primarily under the concessionaire model. Due to the fundamental
structural differences between the models, the economic and other factors applicable to businesses operating
under the car park operator model are not fully representative of our business; rather, we believe our business
more closely resembles the business of infrastructure companies operating under long-term concessions.

**Car parking locations**

The car park industry can be divided into various segments with different characteristics:

_•_ _City Centre_

    - High frequency / supply constraint

    - 24 hour operation

_•_ _Office_

    - Control of access (visitor, staff)

    - Mainly daily parking 5/7 days

_•_ _Shopping Centre_

    - Regulation of access to parking facilities and traffic management

- _Hotel_

    - Mainly overnight / medium-term parking

    - 24 hour operation

- _Residential_

    - 24 hour operations

- _Hospital_

    - Control of access to hospital premises (visitor, patient, staff)

- _University_

    - Control of access to university premises (students, staff)


-----

- _Station /Airport_

    - Medium (station) to large (airport) number of spaces

    - Short and long term parking

    - Dedicated car rental spaces

    - 24 hour operation, strong peaks

- _Stadium/Events_

    - Often large number of spaces

    - High peaks

    - Short to medium-term parking

    - Highly seasonal business

- _Tourism_

    - Highly seasonal

**Key characteristics of the concessionaire parking industry**

The concessionaire parking industry benefits from several characteristics that are exhibited by infrastructure
assets:

- _Demand risk: Demand risk for parking operators is primarily driven by location and contract type. On-street_
parking concessions typically have low demand risk since the operator’s income is primarily based on a fixed
fee. Off-street parking concessions have a higher demand risk which is closely tied to location, however, for
attractive locations in city centers or near hospitals or other locations with consistent traffic, demand risk is
lower.

- _Limited direct competition: We believe that car park users typically do not park more than a short walk from_
their ultimate destination. Therefore, for off-street parking facilities, competition is essentially on a street-bystreet basis, restricted to small geographic areas near the parking facility which tends to be limited, especially
for unique locations in city centers. For on-street activities, the typical concession provides for a territory
defined by the municipality and, as such, there is no competition for other public on-street parking. For offstreet activities, planning permission for “green field” developments is generally difficult for developers to obtain
given limited space. As a result, competition between industry players is normally focused on the tender
process. Once a tender is awarded, operators are generally able to accurately estimate demand for their
parking facilities.

- _An essential asset for municipalities: Parking, in all its forms, has become a fundamental amenity used by_
municipalities in city planning and for transit regulation, especially as oversights in planning can lead to
negative consequences on the traffic and functionality of the city. Local governments in Europe have increased
the amount of overall area used for parking under management which includes both regulated on-street areas
and areas off public thoroughfares. Beyond city planning, municipalities look to parking as one of the most
basic and essential services they provide to businesses, commuters and tourists. Parking also provides a
reliable source of revenue for municipalities, with low capital intensity. As a result, municipalities have a vested
interest in ensuring the availability and reliability of high-quality parking in their jurisdictions, creating
opportunities for the car park industry to continue to expand.

- _Nature of customer base: We believe that the off-street parking categories of the parking industry mainly cater_
to more affluent individuals such as professionals and other skilled workers that commute daily to their
workplaces and require parking spaces on a recurring basis. Demand from this segment of the workforce tends
to have a low level of elasticity and contributes to the stability of volumes and revenues even during economic
downturns.

- _Capital intensity: For off-street parking concessions, there is typically a large initial capital outlay in order to_
build the facilities; however, relatively low levels of capital expenditures are required to maintain the facilities
over the term of the contract. Minimal capital is required for on-street parking concessions.

- _Manageable operating cash costs: The car park operator’s ongoing cash cost base consists primarily of labor_
costs, which can be increased or decreased with some flexibility, especially when compared to other


-----

infrastructure assets. This labor flexibility can provide potential cost savings when employee productivity
increases through the use of technology.

- _Regulatory regime: Concessions are governed by public laws and regulations in Spain and Portugal similar to_
those that govern toll roads and other public concessions. As a result, concessionaires, unlike car park
operators, have benefitted from financial rebalancing provisions contained in such laws and in Terms of Tender
in some circumstances. These provisions require the municipality to compensate the concessionaire
(amending the contract) if fundamental changes occur in the economic arrangements of the contract after its
execution. See “Regulation”.

**Market developments**

Several factors have contributed to the development and improvement of the car park industry in Europe.

- _Urbanization and growth in number of cars: The car park industry has an inherent growth factor due to_
population and the continued increase in urbanization. As population levels grow, the number of cars tends to
increase leading to higher demand for parking, especially in city centers where the supply is rigid due to the
difficulties of developing new infrastructure in these areas. Over the last decade, the number of people in urban
areas has increased to two-thirds of the European population. Continued urbanization contributes to the growth
of the car park industry. Between 1995 and 2011, the number of cars owned has increased from 380 cars per
1,000 residents to 483 cars per 1,000 residents in the European Union. According to the DBK Report and the
Spanish Statistical Office (Instituto Nacional de Estadística), in 2012, there were approximately 27 million cars
in Spain and Portugal. The increasing number of cars on the road, combined with continued urbanization, is a
significant contributor to demand for car parking services.

- _Increase value added services: The car park industry can benefit from providing consumers with value-added_
services, including electric vehicle charging docks, car washing services, bicycle rentals and mobile telephone
coverage. These services can result in increased revenue sources and higher levels of customer satisfaction
and loyalty.

- _Technology utilization: The car park industry has begun to develop technology that leads to more profitable and_
efficient operations, and responds effectively to user needs. Innovations in the automation of car park
management systems and advancements in centralized control systems and operations are important
developments in off-street parking facilities, which reduce the amount of labor required, making management
more efficient and effective. Technology platforms are being utilized for our on-street parking operations in
order to more efficiently manage the area covered by the concession.

- _Outsourcing: Using a car park company often leads to cost savings and complementary income for the_
operators such as hospitals, municipalities and shopping malls.

- _Environmental: As the environmental impact of urbanization becomes an increasingly important issue for local_
authorities, parking planning and parking fees are important tools for municipalities to control the volume and
flow of traffic.

- _Traffic control: There are growth opportunities for more parking facilities within cities, even in mature markets_
throughout Europe. As densely populated cities continue to develop, municipalities may seek to increase the


-----

amount of available parking through the development of additional underground parking structures.
Additionally, as municipalities increasingly view paid parking as a means to generate revenue, municipalities
are increasing the number of metered on-street parking spaces, which tends to result in higher demand for offstreet parking spaces. In some cities in Europe, municipalities have implemented congestion charges and
other measures to reduce traffic and benefit the environment. However, we believe that it is unlikely such
measures will be implemented in Spain or Portugal as public transport is well developed and we believe such
measures would be politically unpopular.

**Spanish car park industry**

The car park industry in Spain has a long history, with concessions going back to the 1960s. The Spanish
Association of Car Parks and Garages (ASESGA), which was formed in 1977, has 1,000 company members that
manage an estimated 850,000 parking spaces in 2,050 lots, garages or parking zones in Spain. According to the
DBK Report, there are approximately 1.1 million on-street and off-street parking spaces throughout Spain, 47% of
which are on-street parking and 53% of which are off-street parking, including car parks in residential areas,
short-term parking structures in hospitals, airports and shopping centers among others. There has been an
increase in the supply of parking spaces in Spain in response to, amongst others, rising population levels in urban
areas and an increase in automobiles.

According to the European Automobile Manufacturing Association (ACEA) report in 2011, Spain accounted for
9.2% of all the cars in use throughout the European Union. Despite the economic downturn, the purchase of new
automobiles has continued, although at slightly reduced levels; ACEA reported that in 2012 Spain accounted for
approximately 0.7 million new private vehicles and SUV registrations which represented 5.6% of all new private
vehicles and SUV registrations in Europe (ranked 5th after Germany, UK, France and Italy).

According to DBK, the car park industry in Spain has a market size of €810 million measured by recurring
revenue in 2012. For purposes of this “Industry” section, recurring revenue refers only to rentals and excludes
sales of parking spaces, publicity or other revenue. The DBK Report estimates that in 2012, the five largest
parking operators accounted for roughly 43% of the total market. Additionally, there is a large “tail” of smaller
participants with highly localized operations.

On-street parking is increasing in Spain, as it is commonly becoming an important component of urban planning.
We have also observed a trend towards outsourcing the management of facilities in public places such as
shopping centers, hospitals, train stations and universities. The autonomous communities of Madrid and Cataluña
account for the largest concentration of off-street parking spaces, totaling 44% of all operating parking spaces in
2012. The autonomous communities of Andalucía and Valencia account for the second highest concentrations,
with 10% of the total amount in each.

As indicated by the graphs below, according to the DBK Report, the car park industry in Spain has exhibited
resiliency during the current economic downturn, experiencing only minor decreases in market size between 2008
and 2012 (CAGR: -1.5%). The number of cars in Spain has shown a positive performance, having increased
consecutively in the last four years. While the ability to generate revenue is largely determined by the portfolio of
contracts and concessions, we believe that some operators and concessionaires are well positioned to benefit
from strong growth in the coming years as parking volumes start to show early signs of stabilization.

In addition, as already described, there has been an increase in the supply of parking spaces in Spain due to
increased population levels in urban areas and more cars. The number of parking spaces (on-street plus offstreet) has increased over the last five years as shown in the graph below:

**Portuguese car park industry**

In Portugal, the development of the car park industry began to accelerate in the 1990s with the initiation of
municipal auctions for car park concessions. The Portuguese National Association of Car Park Businesses
(ANEPE) was formed in 1996 and currently has 19 member businesses that manage 130,000 parking spaces
throughout Portugal. In 2012, the Portuguese Association of Cars (ACAP) reported, there were 4.5 million cars in
Portugal. While the total number of cars remained stable as compared to previous years, the ACEA reported
approximately 95,000 new private vehicle and SUV registrations in 2012. The city of Lisbon and Oporto
accounted for approximately 37% of total vehicles in 2011. In 2011, the density of cars in Portugal was 447 cars
per 1,000 inhabitants below the European average of 483 cars per 1,000 inhabitants.

In 2012, the total market size measured by revenue of the car parking industry was €110 million and there were
285,000 parking spaces in Portugal, including 195,000 off-street parking spaces and 90,000 regulated on-street
spaces. Of 2012 turnover in the industry, 70% came from off-street parking management. The car parking market
in Portugal is geographically concentrated, principally in the areas of Lisbon and Oporto which account for 39%
and 18% of total off-street parking spaces, respectively. Construction projects for new car parks in other areas
have also been completed in recent years, and there is increasing expansion of regulated on-street parking in
mid-size towns. The number of car parking spaces in Portugal has grown from 265,000 parking spaces in 2009 to
285,000 in 2012, which represents an average annual growth rate of approximately 2.5%, as a result of a higher
demand due to more cars and more population in urban areas.

The graphs below exhibit the strong growth the Portuguese car park industry market experienced before the
economic downturn and the resiliency of the industry during the last several years, only experiencing more
significant decreases in the last year due to the extreme difficulties Portugal went through as a result of the
austerity measures imposed by the Portuguese state as a condition of its bailout by the European Union. The
parking market in Portugal is currently at the same level as of 2009, providing room for sustainable growth in the
upcoming years.

**Competition in Iberia**

We compete with a range of large, medium and small-sized operators in each of our three business lines. Many of
our competitors have larger proportions of on-street concessions and off-street contract management, in
particular with private entities. Additionally, many of our competitors focus on specific regions of the Iberian
Peninsula. Competition tends to depend on the nature of the contract or concession.

We believe that most customers generally do not park more than a short walk away from their destination, and
competition tends to be concentrated in small areas. Accordingly, the competition between different parking
options is limited, especially in city centers and other densely populated areas. Our experience has been that
competition in Spain and Portugal from new car parks is limited given the difficulties and economic impracticality
of building new facilities in prime locations. Additionally, given the high level of car usage and limited alternative
forms of transport, there is limited competition from public transportation. Due to these factors, the primary area of
competition among different car park operators is in winning new concessions and renewing existing concessions.

For off-street parking concessions, competition is essentially on a street-by-street basis with on-street parking and
off-street parking alternatives. Competition is minimal for prime locations since the high density of city centers and
planning regulations make the approval process for “green field” car parks difficult. Therefore concession


-----

operators, especially those in prime locations, typically face limited competition within the local area near the
facility.

For on-street parking concessions, there are several barriers to entry such as technology and relevant
administrative qualifications. As a result, the on-street parking concession business is concentrated among a
limited number of operators, including Empark. Once an operator has won a concession, the operator has
exclusivity on the on-street parking within the concession area. Additionally, since the remuneration in these
contracts tends to be more from fixed fees, these concessions have limited exposure to demand risk.

The off-street contract management sector has lower barriers to entry than on-street parking concessions and
competition among operators for contracts is more intense. Similarly to on-street parking concessions, the
remuneration under the contracts tends to come more from fixed fees, so the operators have limited exposure to
demand risk. Additionally, for contracts in certain locations such as airports and ferries (which are the types of
contracts Empark has in this sector), the parking facility typically has no direct competition in the area.

The following tables show the five largest operators of parking facilities (by parking spaces) in Spain and Portugal.

and Portugal in 2012:

_Source: DBK Sectores: Aparcamientos (Spain and Portugal), March 2013_

Note: Market size based on revenues has been obtained from the rentals of off-street and on-street parking spaces only (it does not include revenues
from sale of car parking spaces or other revenues obtained from publicity and/or other value added activities).

AENA and Barcelona Serveis Municipals have not been taken into account when determining the market share of
the top 5 operators, but they have been included to reach the total market size. This is because they are owners
of parking spaces but not operators.

The difference in market share when comparing market share by revenues to car parking spaces illustrates the
different dynamics and prices of on-street concessions and off-street concessions. For example, EMEL has
roughly the same market share by car parking spaces (17%) as Empark but only has 17% of the market share by
revenues while Empark has 29% of the market share by revenues. Empark is a market leader in the Iberian car
parks industry both in terms of car parking spaces and revenues.

# Regulation

The following is a brief summary of the regulatory regimes of Spain and Portugal applicable to our business.

**Spain**

**General**

Car parks in Spain may be developed either privately or through the public concessionary regime. Car parks
developed through the public concessionary regime are usually located on publicly owned land and involve the
exercise of public administrative powers (principally by municipalities) relating to the regulation of traffic and local
public highways. The legal regime governing car parks developed through the public concessionary regime is
more complex than that for private car parks. The operation of public car parks, which is usually granted to private
parties under administrative concessions, is subject to the ongoing control of the public authorities that grant the
concessions.

In contrast, car parks that are privately developed are usually built on privately owned land and are subject to a
less complex regulatory regime than the regime applicable to car parks developed through the public
concessionary regime. Private car park operators are generally required to obtain municipal licenses (which
generally cover environmental matters) in order to build and operate car parks and are subject to certain
legislation governing the car park industry, particularly with respect to tariffs and consumer rights. For example,
Law 40/2002 of November 14, which regulates car park agreements and sets forth the duties of car park
operators and their liabilities for personal injury and property damage, is applicable to privately developed car
parks.

Under the relevant Spanish laws, the operator of a parking facility is liable for any damages to the vehicle and its
contents. The provider of parking services is liable for movable components, accessories or objects when certain
conditions are met, including that such movable components, accessories or objects are expressly declared by
the user, that the provider of parking services expressly accepts their custody, and that the user complies with
security measures.

The following summary applies to car parks developed through the public concessionary regime and accordingly
subject to the public regulatory regime.

**Applicable legislation**

The construction and operation of off-street parking facilities and on-street parking services pursuant to
concessions granted by public authorities are regulated in Spain by public laws which govern the construction,
maintenance and operation of public car parks and contractual arrangements between private parties and
Spanish public authorities (mainly municipalities). Public laws also impose certain requirements and limitations
with respect to various types of contracts entered into with public authorities.

In general, contracts entered into with public authorities in Spain are currently governed by the Public Sector
Contracts Law, a consolidated text approved by Legislative Royal Decree 3/2011 of November 14 (the
“TRLCSP”). Contracts entered into prior to the effectiveness of the TRLCSP are governed by the legislation on
contracts in force when such contracts were entered. Prior to the effectiveness of the TRLCSP, the relevant
legislation was the Public Sector Contracts Law, 30/2007 of October 30 (the “LCSP”). Prior to the effectiveness of
the LCSP, the relevant legislation was the Law of Contracts with Public Authorities, a consolidated text approved
by Legislative Royal Decree 2/2000 of June 16. Prior to the effectiveness of this law, Law 13/1995 of May 18, on
Contracts with the Public Authorities was the relevant legislation in force.

In addition, contracts entered into with municipalities are also usually governed by the Local Public Bodies
Services Regulations, approved by the Decree of June 17, 1955, as currently in force. In addition, certain of
Spain’s autonomous regions have enacted legislation with respect to matters involving local public authorities and
local matters. For example, in the Catalonian autonomous region, Decree 179/1995 of June 13, regulates certain
activities of local public authorities in Cataluña.

**Public tender process and award**

Concessions for public car parks and on-street parking are generally awarded through a public tender process.
Pursuant to the relevant legislation, the public authorities enter into contracts for the concessions with private
parties selected through the public tender process. Under the public tender process, interested parties may


-----

submit their bids for the concession. The specific conditions of the concession contract are set forth in the terms
of tender (Pliegos de Condiciones Administrativas y Técnicas) (the “Terms of Tender”) and in the contract itself.
These conditions may differ and establish particular legal, economic and technical terms for each type of contract
and for each project. The specific legal and contractual regime applicable to each concession contract is
determined by the contract and the Terms of Tender for the concession, as well as the relevant legislation in
effect at the time the concession was awarded.

**Types of contracts**

The relevant legislation contemplates that public car parks may be operated generally under three different types
of contracts: (i) a contract for the management of a public service without works, which is for the management
and/or maintenance of a previously built car park (a “brown field” concession); (ii) a contract for the management
of a public service with works; and (iii) a contract for a concession of public works. In this context, “works” refers
to the construction of a parking facility (a “green field” concession). In some cases, significant repair, restructure
or redesign work on the parking facility, as well as the construction of a secondary infrastructure connected to the
principal one, may also be considered “works”. A contract for concession of public works is considered under the
relevant legislation to be a different type of contract than one for the management of a public service with works,
but they are functionally similar. There are no significant differences between regulations applicable to
(a) contracts for the concession of public works; (b) contracts for the management of public services with works;
and (c) contracts for the management of public services without works, except for: (i) the maximum duration of the
contract, which is between 40 and 46 years, in the case of (a), and 50 years, in the case of (b), and 25 years in
the case of (c); and (ii) the possibility of securing the financing of the construction or works by mortgaging or
pledging the concession, subject to authorization of the grantor of the concession, which is regulated by law for
the concession of public works and may be permitted in contracts for the management of public services with
works, but generally is not permitted in contracts for the management of public services without works.

In general, most contracts for the operation of on-street parking usually take the form of a concession for the
management of a public service without works, provided that it is not necessary to build any infrastructure for the
operation. Off-street car parks are usually operated under a contract for management of a public service with
works, since it is usually necessary to build the cark park. However, Law 13/2003 of May 23, on the public works
concession agreement (“Law of Public Works Concession Agreements”), which came into force in 2003, was
integrated in the LCSP and is currently included in the TRLCSP, reinforced and promoted the use of the contract
for a concession of public works. The primary type of contract used for the building and subsequent operation of
off-street car parks is a contract for a concession of public works.

Certain concessions may be governed by Public Assets Law 33/2003, of November 3, but such concessions are
rarely used in practice to operate car parks, because the regime of public assets would not be the optimal way to
operate car parks from a legal point of view as parking concessions can be developed through the different
classes of concessions specifically regulated in the TRLCSP.
**Term and renewal of administrative concessions**

In general, contracts for the management of a public service have a maximum statutory term of 50 years if they
require the construction of a facility, and 25 years if they do not include works. Contracts for a concession of
public works have a maximum term of 40 years, extendable in certain circumstances for another six years (or
15% of the initial term). For any contract, the contract and the Terms of Tender will establish the contract’s term,
which term may not exceed the maximum term permitted by the relevant legislation.

In certain circumstances, the term may be extended provided that such possibility of extension had been
contemplated in the Terms of Tender and that the maximum term permitted by the relevant legislation is not
exceeded.

After the term of the contract expires (including the envisaged extensions), the contract may not be renewed
without undergoing a public tender process.

**Concept of economic-financial rebalancing**

The public authority that awards a concession contract has the authority to interpret the terms of the contract and
to amend the terms of the contract for “reasons of public interest” and for other justified grounds. As a result, the
municipality cannot amend the contract based on any political initiative but only under these limited
circumstances.


-----

The concept of reasons of public interest is not clearly defined in case law, and there is a risk in the interpretation
of this concept by the awarding authority. In any event, the awarding authority must justify the existence of the
reason of public interest in each particular case, and this interpretation may be challenged in court.

In general, contracts are executed on the “principle of risk and venture” of the contractor, whereby the contractor
must assume the consequences that, in economic terms, may arise from the execution of the contract, as they
were agreed. Under Spanish law, the concept of financial rebalancing arises as a means to modulate the
application of the “principle of risk and venture” since its strict application could imply serious damage for the
contractor and for the public interest in certain events that could result in the failure of the concession, and
accordingly, of the public service inherent in it.

The public authority may rebalance the economic terms of the contract upon the occurrence of three general
types of events if such events result in a change to the disadvantage of the concessionaire in the fundamental
economic balance that existed when the contract was awarded (and not just in a mere reduction of the expected
profits of the concessionaire):

(i) a direct amendment by the public authority that granted the concession of the features of the works or
services that are the subject matter of the contract (such as the quality, quantity, time or place of
performance of the obligation);

(ii) the adoption of general administrative measures that have a direct and material effect on the contract, thus
making the contract more burdensome for the concessionaire; or

(iii) non-contractual and extraordinary causes that were unforeseen at the time the parties entered into the
contract.

The concessionaire can make a claim to the public authority for financial rebalancing and must provide evidence
of the event and demonstrate the repercussions that results in the imbalance of the previously agreed terms. The
public authority may apply various measures to rebalance the economic-financial terms of the contract. In
general, the public authority will provide compensation for the imbalance that such amendments, measures or
events imply for the concessionaire or the loss and damage caused. The scope of the rebalancing will be the
amount necessary, in terms of prices, costs or other elements, to adjust, reasonably, the economic-financial
situation to that agreed in the concession contract. The degree of compensation (complete or partial) granted will
depend, essentially, on the cause of the imbalance.
The TRLCSP generally contemplates, depending on the circumstances, the following measures to achieve
rebalancing:

(i) amending the tariffs payable by the users;

(ii) in certain circumstances, amending the term of the contract (however, this would be subject to the
maximum legal term for the concession); and

(iii) amending the clauses that contain the substantive economic terms of the contract.

The Terms of Tender and the terms of the concession contract may specifically limit the scope of the
circumstances under which a claim for financial rebalancing is available.

In addition to the provisions of TRLCSP, the procedure to exercise the right to economic rebalancing is
established under Law 29/1998 of July 13. According to this law, the party seeking to enforce such right must first
notify the awarding authority of the breach of the economic balance and petition the awarding authority to fulfill its
contractual obligation by carrying out an economic rebalancing of the concession. If, after a three-month period
has lapsed, the concessionaire and the awarding authority have not reached an agreement to rebalance the
concession or the concessionaire determines that the resolution was insufficient, the concessionaire may then
appeal to the courts. The duration of such court proceedings depends on many factors, such as the number of
appeals required to obtain a definitive judicial resolution (generally two appeals) and the volume of cases handled
by the relevant court at the particular time. Typically, court proceedings to obtain an order for economic
rebalancing of a concession take approximately one year to complete the first trial and two additional years until a
decision is affirmed on appeal if successful, but there can be no assurance that such court proceedings will be
completed within this time frame.

The recognition of the financial rebalancing in favor of the concessionaire generally implies an amendment to the
terms of the contract. Therefore, the rebalancing provisions are considered to be effective from the moment of the
contract amendment, without prejudice to the possibility of taking into consideration when the change that
prompted the rebalancing occurred when deciding the scope of the rebalancing.


-----

**Concession tariffs and other remuneration arrangements**

The Terms of Tender and the contract establish the tariff scheme to remunerate the concessionaire.

Usually off-street car parks are remunerated in accordance with the use of the parking spaces. Thus, short-term
parking spaces (rotación) are usually remunerated by a regulated tariff which is adjusted regularly according to
the consumer price index or another formula relating to inflation. It is customary for the concessionaire to include
the tariffs in its offer and subsequently request approval from the public authority for changes to the tariffs
established in the contract, accordingly to the Terms of Tender.

In addition, as an ancillary activity, we can sell a limited number of parking spaces to local residents for a price
established in the contract, accordingly to the Terms of Tender.

Concessionaires are usually remunerated under on-street concession contracts through a flat fee or by reference
to a percentage of the amount collected for the provision of the service less costs or a fee.

**Authorizations and change of control clauses**

Under some contractual arrangements, public authorities impose certain restrictions on the transfer of ownership
of the concessionaire and the guarantees and security interests that the concessionaire can grant to third parties.
For example, the concession contract may require the prior authorization of the public authority in order for the
concessionaire to grant a mortgage
over the concession. In some cases, a concession contract may contain a change of control clause, which
prohibits the transfer of the ownership of the concessionaire without the prior approval of the public authority. In
addition, public authorities may terminate the concession in the event that insolvency or winding-up proceedings
are instituted against the concessionaire.

General public procurement laws (including TRLCSP, and the precedent LCSP, LCAP, TRLCAP) do not regulate
transfers of shares in companies holding contracts or concessions. Although a legal theory of the Council of State
(the supreme consultative council of the Spanish government) attempts to consider changes of control through
the transfer of shares the same as events of assignment of contracts or concessions (thus requiring authorization
of the municipality for such transfer), the successive public procurement laws passed have not adopted this
approach. However, the Terms of Tender and specific contracts may contain provisions requiring prior
communication and authorization for direct or indirect transfers of shares. Additionally, local municipalities may
choose to apply this theory of the Council of State which would require prior authorization for direct or indirect
changes of control of the concessionaire, even though this is not explicitly required in the Terms of Tender, the
contract or applicable regulations.

The Autonomous Community of Cataluña approved Decree 179/1995, of June 13 covering the transfer of shares
in companies that manage local services. Such regulation is in force and applies to our concessions in Cataluña,
despite some controversy as to whether or not it contravenes basic State laws. Article 241 of said Decree
contemplates as an event of termination of the concession “…in the case of companies, the transfer of shares
that is material and implies a change of management or of control of the company or a material modification of the
conditions on which the contract was executed”. This provision regulates the direct transfer of the shares of the
concessionaire of the local service but does not expressly contemplate the indirect transfer through a parent
company of the concessionaire. Consequently, we believe such provision should not apply to indirect transfers.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, there is a risk that one or more municipal councils might consider, in practice, that
an indirect transfer also falls within the scope of said article. Should the municipal councils of Cataluña apply such
provision to indirect changes of control, it could be argued that such application goes beyond the stated legal
provision. However, in the event of an enforcement action under the terms of the Notes or Note Guarantees which
resulted in the transfer of ownership of Empark, or a change in the shareholder composition of Empark for other
reasons, the local authorities may attempt to cancel our concessions in Cataluña on such basis.

**Termination of the concession**

Under the current regulatory regime, a concession contract can be terminated under the following circumstances:
(i) extinguishment of the legal personality of the concessionaire through winding up and liquidation; (ii) court order
of insolvency in a “concurso” proceeding or in any other proceeding; (iii) mutual agreement between the authority
and the concessionaire; (iv) delay in the performance of the terms by the concessionaire or a breach of the term
for commencement of the performance of the contract; (v) delay in payment by the public authority beyond the
legal established term for payment, which is six months; (vi) breach of the essential contractual obligations,
classified as such in the Terms of Tender or in the contract; (vii) impossibility of performance of the obligation on
the initially agreed terms or certain probability of causing serious damage to the public interest should the


-----

obligation continue to be performed on such terms, where it is impossible to amend the contract; (viii) the
confiscation of the concession, the recovery of the public service and the termination in the management of a
public work or service for public interest reasons; and (ix) any other circumstances expressly contemplated in the
contract.

**Liability and compensation for termination of concession contract**

In the event of the termination of a concession contract due to breach by the public authority, the authority will be
liable for payment of the loss and damage caused to the concessionaire. Likewise, a termination of the contract
due to the intentional breach by the concessionaire will result in the concessionaire being liable for indemnifying
the authority for the loss and damage caused. Such indemnification will be enforced first against the performance
bond provided by the concessionaire to the public authority.

In general (and unless the Terms of Tender and concession contract provide otherwise), in the event of an early
termination of a concession, regardless of whether or not such termination is attributable to the concessionaire,
the public authority will pay to the concessionaire an amount representing the investment the concessionaire has
made to develop the concession. In determining the amount of such investment, the amortization of the
investment will be taken into account according to the time remaining to the expiry of the concession and to the
terms of the economic-financial plan provided by the concessionaire in its bid containing the estimated economics
expected under the concession.

**Portugal**

**General**

As in Spain, in Portugal car parks may be developed either privately or through the public concessionary regime.
Similar to Spain, car parks developed through the public concessionary regime are located on publicly owned
land and involve the exercise of municipal administrative powers relating to the regulation of traffic and local
public highways. The legal regime governing car parks developed through the public concessionary regime is
more complex than that for private car parks. Car parks developed through the public concessionary regime are
managed by a private party under an administrative concession or similar arrangement granted by a public
authority, and they are subject to the ongoing control of the public authorities that grant the concession or
arrangement.

Car parks that are privately developed are usually built on privately owned land and are subject to a less complex
regulatory regime than the regime applicable to car parks developed through the public concessionary regime.
The terms and conditions applicable to privately operated car parking facilities are contractual in nature although
subject to the applicable mandatory private law provisions. Enforceability of rights under the above mentioned
agreements towards third parties may depend on their prior registration before the competent land registry offices,
notably in the case of ownership rights, surface rights and lease agreements with a term equal or in excess to six
years. Private car park operators generally are required to obtain municipal licenses in order to build and operate
the car park and are subject to certain legislation governing the car park industry, particularly with regard to tariffs
and consumer rights. For example, Decree-Law 81/2006 of April 20, which regulates the use and access
conditions to car parks, is applicable to privately developed car parks.

There is no specific legislation relating to the liability of car park operators for injury and property damage in car
parks and therefore the general liability rules of the Portuguese Civil Code are applicable. According to the
applicable general rules, car park operators may be liable for injury and property damage to the extent that the
damage in question results from an intentional or negligent violation of a third party right. In off-street car parks,
car park operators may also be liable for damages caused by third parties (for example theft) in cases where the
car park operator assumes an obligation to assure the safety of the vehicles parked. However, in most cases, car
park operators explicitly exclude these obligations in the terms and conditions of use posted in the facility for
damages caused by third parties to the vehicles parked. There are court decisions recognizing the validity of this
exclusion in situations where the car operator had included such exclusion in the conditions of use posted in the
facility.

The following summary covers car parks operated through the public concessionary regime and accordingly
subject to the public regulatory regime.
**Applicable legislation**

The construction and operation of public parking structures and on-street parking normally takes place under
concession agreements (typically for on-street parking) or under surface rights agreements (typically for off-street
parking), usually entered into with municipalities.


-----

The construction and operation of public parking structures and on-street parking are regulated through the
enactment of public laws which govern the formation and execution of public contracts by municipal regulations
and by contractual arrangements with municipalities.

An administrative concession is used by public authorities to promote the development of public works by private
entities that will subsequently operate such public works (a “public works concession”) or to contract a private
entity to operate a certain public service, in principle, without involving any kind of construction (a “public service
_concession”), although some public service concessions may imply also some construction works as an ancillary_
obligation.

A surface right is a right to build and maintain a certain construction for a specified period of time over the
property of the granting authority. Surface rights agreements entered into with public entities for the construction
of off-street parking facilities whilst subject to the rules applicable to the formation and execution of public
contracts as referred above may also be subject to private law.

The concessions for the construction and management of parking facilities and on-street parking are currently
regulated in Portugal through the Public Contracts Code, approved by Decree-Law 18/2008 of January 29
(“Public Contracts Code”). The Public Contracts Code includes provisions relating to the formation, execution and
termination of concession agreements. Prior to the Public Contracts Code, these agreements were regulated by
Decree-Laws 59/99 of March 2 (that governed public works contracts), 390/82 of September 17, that also
imposed certain rights and obligations with respect to any concessions granted by municipalities. These prior laws
still govern the concession agreements which formation procedures were initiated before the Public Contracts
Code was enacted. One of the most relevant differences between the Public Contracts Code and the former
legislation with regard to administrative concessions is that, upon the enactment of the Public Contracts Code, the
duration of an administrative concession is no longer subject to a strict limitation rule. In the past, administrative
concessions awarded by municipalities, which is the case of all concessions currently operated by the Group in
Portugal, could not exceed 20 years. Instead the duration of such contracts is determined in the contract in line
with the period required to amortize the investment and obtain remuneration under normal market conditions. In
addition, the concessions in the public domain are also subject to Decree-Law 280/2007 of August 7 that sets
forth the legal regime applicable to the management of public property. In some situations the public-private
partnership regulation set forth in Decree-Law 86/2003, of April 26, as amended by Decree-law 14/2006, of
July 27, may apply.

Historically, the term limitation has caused public authorities to adopt surface rights agreements (instead of
concession agreements) in respect of off-street parking in order to allow longer duration periods given that
construction of parking facilities involves investments that could not be amortized within such a short period of
time. Surface rights are not subject to any specific term limitation.

According to the applicable rules, the construction and operation of off-street parking facilities with respect to
publicly owned land subject to the public domain legal regime (the “public domain”) should take place under
concession agreements and, conversely, the construction and operation of off-street facilities with respect to
publicly owned land not subject to the public domain legal regime (the “private domain”) could be made through
surface rights agreements. In order to overcome the above referenced term limitation applicable to concessions
and due to this distinction, the general practice adopted by municipalities has been to disaffect parcels of land
from the municipal public domain and re-incorporate those parcels in the municipal private domain precisely to
allow the execution of surface rights agreements in order to take advantage of the longer term permitted under
surface rights agreements.
Currently, the execution of surface rights agreements (in respect of public-owned properties) for the construction
of off-street parking facilities may also be subject to tender procedures established in the Public Contracts Code
(to the extent that they contain typical stipulations and characteristics of the agreements subject to this Code)
and, in addition, is subject to Decree-Law 280/2007 of August 7 that sets forth the legal regime applicable to the
management of public property. If the tender surface right contracts are qualified as administrative contracts, then
the execution regime of the Public Contracts Code will also apply. Prior to the enactment of this legislation, the
execution of such surface rights agreements was also subject to Decree-Laws 59/99 of March 2, 390/82 of
September 17 and to Decree-Law 794/76 of November 5. These prior laws still govern older surface rights
agreements which formation procedures were initiated before the Public Contracts Code was enacted.

**Public tender process and award**

The public authorities enter into contracts with the private parties selected through tender processes in which the
interested parties may submit their tenders. The specific conditions of these contracts are set forth in the Terms of
Tender (“Caderno de Encargos”) and in the contract. These conditions may differ among contracts and establish


-----

particular legal features for each specific project, while using the aforementioned legal framework as a reference.
Theoretically the grant of a surface right could be made, according to Decree-Law 280/2007 by direct award or
through a negotiated procedure, however, given the fact that the surface rights in question substantially contain
the typical elements of a concession, they are usually awarded through the aforementioned tender procedures.

**Types of contracts**

The legislation contemplates various types of contracts. Typically, car parks may operate under three different
classes of contract: (i) a contract for concession of management of a public service without works; (ii) a contract
for concession of public works; and (iii) a surface rights agreement.

Most contracts for the operation of on-street car parks take the form of a concession for the management of a
public service without works, provided that it is not necessary to build any relevant infrastructure for their
operation.

Most of the contracts currently in force for the off-street car parks are operated under surface rights agreements
awarded by the municipalities, since, as discussed above, prior to the Public Contracts Code’s adoption in 2008
concessions awarded by municipalities were limited to a term of 20 years. Although even after the enactment of
the Public Contracts Code the municipalities maintain the previous trend of resorting to surface rights agreements
for the off-street car parks, it is possible that in the future car parks developed through the public concessionary
regime will be more often awarded through concession contracts.

**Term and renewal of administrative concessions and surface rights**

Currently, the applicable legislation does not impose a specific term limit for administrative concessions. The law
establishes that the duration shall be determined in contract taking into account the reasonable period of time
required under normal market conditions to amortize the investment and obtain a fair return on the investment. In
the absence of such contractual clause stipulating the duration of the concession agreement, the Public Contracts
Code sets forth a 30 year term.

Upon expiration of the agreement, the contract may not be renewed without a prior public tender process.
Nevertheless, under certain circumstances, the agreement may be extended provided that such possibility had
been contemplated by the contract, however rights and certain preference rights for the grant of new surface
rights may be deemed null and void.

Surface rights agreements entered into in connection with publicly owned properties do not have a statutory term
limit but will have the term specified in the contract, in accordance with public interest criteria and taking into
account the economic balance of the service that will be operated under the agreement. The applicable legislation
does not allow the renewal of surface rights upon expiration of the contract. Surface rights agreements normally
have a long-term and, upon their expiration, a new agreement will need to be executed following a public tender if
the Public Contracts Code applies. Otherwise, a limited, a negotiated or a direct award procedure could apply.

**Economic-financial balance**

In general, public contracts are executed based on the principle that the business risk is assumed by the private
entity.

Notwithstanding this, the law foresees certain situations that may lead to a modification of the terms initially
agreed in order to ensure that the public service is not affected in the face of abnormal and unpredictable
circumstances or unilateral modification of the contract imposed on public interest grounds by the public entities.
In light of the Public Contracts Code, the concessionaire or the holder of a surface right (to the extent that such
right contains typical stipulations and characteristics of the agreements subject to the Code) is only entitled to the
re-establishment of the economic balance of the contract in the following situations:

(i) when the circumstances upon which the parties have grounded their decision to enter into contract suffer
an abnormal and unpredictable modification imputable to the awarding authority acting beyond the
contractual frame; or

(ii) when the agreement is modified by the public entity for public interest reasons.

According to the Public Contracts Code the means to re-establish the financial balance may be included in the
contracts. There are no legislative limits with respect to the mechanisms that may be adopted, but often such
mechanisms include revision of tariffs, adding parking spaces or a provision stating that the authority and the
concessionaire shall jointly seek an agreement to re-establish the financial balance of the contract. In the absence


-----

of contractual provisions, the Public Contracts Code (applicable to concessions and possibly to the surface rights
agreements if the tender program determines its applicability or because the contract is materially a concession
contract) stipulates that re-establishment of the balance shall be achieved through the extension of the
contractual term, through the revision of prices or through the payment of compensation. Any other situation
involving an abnormal and unpredictable modification of the circumstances will trigger the right to a modification of
the agreement or to receive compensation (without necessarily implying the re-establishment of the initial
economic balance).

The legal framework applicable under the former laws to concessions and surface rights agreements did not
specify the rebalancing right and mechanism, at least in such detail. However, either by appealing to general rules
and principles of Law or through the use of contractual conditions establishing the rebalance right, one could
sustain such rebalancing right in similar situations and therefore, from a practical point of view, the final applicable
framework may not differ substantially from the one currently in force.

There is no specific claim procedure prescribed by law to apply for the financial rebalancing of the contract. Under
circumstances that would trigger the rebalancing mechanism, the concessionaire or holder of the surface right
shall apply to the public entity within the contractual framework and in accordance with the general rules
applicable to contracts. In practical terms, a written notice should be sent to the awarding entity stating the facts
underlying to the request and the relevant legal provisions and proposing the modifications required to maintain
the economic balance of the contract. Normally, this will entail a negotiation with the awarding entity. Should the
latter accept the modification or compensation proposed, this would typically be formalized by means of an
amendment to the initial agreement which would be effective as of its date of execution. In the absence of a
favorable decision or in the absence of a decision within a reasonable period of time, a judicial claim may be filed
with the administrative courts or with an arbitral tribunal in cases where the agreement stipulates an arbitration
clause, in order to obtain a ruling ordering the re-establishment of the economic balance or the payment of
compensation. The duration of a court process is difficult to determine, as it depends on numerous factors, such
as the number of appeals to be completed in order to obtain a definitive judicial resolution (generally two appeals),
or the volume of affairs affecting, in each moment, the competent court. Currently in Portugal judicial procedures
in administrative courts may last more than three years but there is no assurance the process will be completed
within this time frame.

**Concession tariffs and other remuneration arrangements**

The Terms of Tender and the contract establish the tariff scheme to remunerate the concessionaire/holder of the
surface right.

Normally with off-street structures the concessionaire/holder of the surface rights is remunerated based on the
collection of the tariffs established in the contract, which are reviewed periodically based on the consumer price
index. In addition, a fixed price or an annual amount may also be payable by the concessionaire/holder of the
surface right to the municipality in consideration for the concession or surface right awarded.

With respect to on-street parking, normally the concessionaire agrees to deliver to the municipality a percentage
of the tariffs collected or, in some cases, a fixed amount and, in other cases a combination of a fixed amount plus
a percentage of the tariffs. It is customary for the concessionaire/holder of surface right to include the tariffs in its
offer to tender and subsequently propose to the awarding authority for its approval revisions of the tariffs as
allowed by the contract.

**Authorizations and change of control clauses**

In some of the contractual arrangements, municipalities impose certain restrictions on the shareholder of the
concessionaire and the guarantees that such concessionaire can grant to third parties, such as the need for prior
authorization to create a mortgage over the concession or, sometimes, change of control clauses.

Legislation relating to these matters does not expressly require prior authorization for share transfers of the
concessionaire or changes of control in it. Nevertheless, the specific Terms of Tender and contracts, or their
interpretation by the awarding authority, may require prior consent for such transactions. However, the applicable
legislation expressly requires prior authorization for mortgages or charges over assets included in the concession
or over the surface right. The need for authorization could also result from the fact that the public tender would
have established prerequisites for the qualification or the evaluation of the proposals that were met by the
tenderer with recourse of the parent company qualifications or expertise.

**Termination of the concession**


-----

Under the current regulatory regime, apart from a termination resulting from contractual breaches, concession
and surface rights agreements may be terminated by the public entity as a result of the following: (i) at any time
due to public policy reasons, provided that appropriate compensation is paid to the concessionaire/holder of the
surface rights (to be calculated according to the contractual regime or, in the absence of contractual provisions, in
accordance with the law); (ii) unauthorized assignment or transfer of the concession or surface right;
(iii) unauthorized creation of mortgages or other charges over the concession or surface right; and (iv) certain
other situations specified in the Public Contracts Code. In addition, the public entity may be entitled to assume the
management of the concession or surface right temporarily in case of severe breach of contract, such as the
failure to perform or pay amounts due. During such period the contract will be suspended and if the operation is
not resumed, the agreement may be terminated.
Contracts usually include provisions stipulating the formula that shall be used to calculate the indemnity payable
in event of early termination grounded on public interest. In general, the formulae are designed to reflect an
amount of indemnity calculated on the basis of the investment that was not amortized and such formulae do not
usually cover loss of profit, which needs to be claimed on the basis of general principles under law. If the
municipality and the concessionaire cannot agree on compensation, the concessionaire may bring an action
against the grantor.

**Liability and compensation for termination of concession contract**

In the event of termination of the contract due to breach by the public authority, the authority will be liable for
payment of the loss and damage caused to the concessionaire/holder of the surface right. Similarly, the
termination of the contract due to intentional breach by the concessionaire/holder of the surface right will result in
such entity being liable to indemnify the authority for the loss and damage caused. Such indemnification may be
enforced initially against the guarantee created, if applicable.

# Business

**Overview**

We are the largest concessionaire and operator of parking infrastructure in the Iberian Peninsula, as measured by
number of parking spaces and revenues. We mainly operate underground car parks (“off-street”) and parking
areas on city streets (“on-street”) under concessions and surface rights agreements from public authorities. As of
September 30, 2013, our portfolio comprised over 310 concessions with more than 160 municipalities and other
contracts with customers such as AENA and ANA, under which we manage over 355,000 parking spaces in
Spain and Portugal. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2013, our net turnover was €177.6 million, our
Adjusted Revenue was €180.4 million and our Adjusted EBITDA was €62.4 million. Our operations in Spain
represented 76.1% of our net turnover, 76.2% of our Adjusted Revenue and 66.7% of our Adjusted EBITDA for
the twelve months ended September 30, 2013.

We have served the Iberian market since the late 1960s, when there were fewer competitors in the developing car
park sector. We believe this has given us a “first mover” advantage, whereby we have secured long-term
concessions and built a portfolio of prime parking locations in Spain and Portugal, including in city centers,
airports and other high density traffic areas, such as hospitals and business districts. Due to a variety of physical,
regulatory and other constraints, we believe that there is limited opportunity to develop alternative parking options
in many of these prime areas, allowing us to benefit from captive demand with limited competition.

**Business Lines**

We operate our business through three business lines: off-street concessions, on-street concessions and offstreet contract management. The following table sets forth our Adjusted Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA by

**Off-street concessions**

Our off-street concession business is our largest business line, representing 78.6% of Adjusted EBITDA for the
twelve months ended September 30, 2013 and having a Weighted average remaining duration of approximately
28 years. This business line primarily consists of concessions with municipalities to operate parking facilities and
underground parking facilities. Under these contracts, we are generally required to invest in the construction of a
new parking facility (a “green field” concession) or make an upfront payment to the municipality for an existing
parking facility (a “brown field” concession). As of September 30, 2013, we operated 172 off-street parking


-----

facilities under this business line, consisting of over 88,800 parking spaces in 76 municipalities, principally in
Spain and Portugal. We also have a small number of off-street contracts and concessions in Turkey (our total net
turnover from Turkey was €3.8 million, or 2.1% of our total net turnover, in 2012) and Andorra (our total net
turnover from Andorra was €0.8 million, or 0.4% of our total net turnover, in 2012).

Our portfolio comprises parking infrastructure located in urban areas and other areas of high traffic density, such
as hospitals, and business and administrative centers. Due to our early entry into the Iberian car park sector, our
concessions include a number of car parks with prime locations that were originally constructed in the 1960s and
1970s. These prime locations include car parks at Plaza Mayor (Madrid), Plaza de las Cortes (Madrid), Praça dos
Restauradores (Lisbon), Praça Luis de Camões (Lisbon), La Concha (San Sebastian), Mercado de Colón
(Valencia) and Plaza de España (Burgos). Many of these locations are in highly transited areas that attract a large
number of visitors for a variety of purposes with limited free or paid alternative parking options. Demand for our
off-street parking facilities in such areas experience relatively low volatility and have remained relatively stable
even during difficult economic conditions.

Generally under off-street concessions, we design, build, finance and operate underground and multi-story
parking infrastructure facilities. These “green field” concessions generally require us to invest capital to build a
facility or make an upfront payment to the municipality for an existing facility in exchange for higher potential
margins and long-term concession contracts. Under our “brown field” concessions, we also pay an annual
concession fee to the municipality. Under the concession (or surface rights agreements, in Portugal), we charge
the end users a tariff (or fee) for the use of the facility. The fees are charged either on a per minute basis for
short-stay tickets or on a daily, weekly, monthly, seasonal or annual basis under a subscription arrangement. The
fees paid by end users are specified under the concession (or surface rights agreement) and generally
automatically increase annually in line with inflation. We generally retain all fees generated from operating our offstreet parking facilities and are responsible for all expenses relating to operating and maintaining the parking
facility during the term of the contract. Our off-street parking facilities are also subject to local taxes, for which we
are responsible. We also generate a small amount of income through some basic amenities we provide to car
park users within our parking facilities, such as vending machines and car washes.

In general, our off-street parking facilities are operated on a 24-hour a day/seven-day a week basis. Most of the
features of the parking facilities are automated, including entry and exit controls and ticket machines. Users can
obtain information about subscriptions and tariffs online and over the phone. The car parks are staffed and
operated by our own employees. We have introduced a centralized system to control and manage a substantial
majority of our off-street parking facilities from a remote location, which has allowed us to reduce personnel costs
by reducing headcount while maintaining our high quality of services and customer satisfaction levels. In addition,
such measures have helped us to reduce our reliance on external service providers by enabling us to reallocate
personnel to perform certain functions previously performed by third party service providers. We are also able to
realize certain economies of scale by using our on-street concession employees in managing our off-street
operations. Routine maintenance, including painting and cleaning, and security for our off-street parking facilities
are provided by both third party contractors and our own employees.
In Spain, contracts for the management of a public service can run for a maximum statutory term of 50 years if
they include works and 25 years if they do not include works. Contracts for a concession of public works can run
for a maximum term of 40 years, extendable in certain circumstances for up to another six years (or 15% of the
initial term).

In Portugal, the term of the concessions for the construction and management of parking facilities is not currently
subject to a strict limitation rule, but the duration of such contracts is determined in line with the period required to
amortize the investment and obtain remuneration under normal market conditions. However, all concessions we
currently operate in Portugal are subject to a prior legal regime whereby the term of administrative concessions
awarded by municipalities could not exceed 20 years. Notwithstanding this, certain of our off-street parking
facilities in Portugal are governed by surface rights agreements with longer terms, such as our 99-year term
Alexandre Herculano (Lisbon) concession. Surface rights agreements entered into in connection with publicly
owned properties do not have a statutory term, but their term is contractually specified in accordance with public
interest criteria and taking into account the economic balance of the service that will be operated under the
agreement.

The vast majority of off-street concessions in Spain and Portugal are awarded as a result of a public bidding
process conducted by the municipalities. Each municipality has authority to determine the location and economic
viability of car parks within its jurisdiction.

As municipalities generally do not want to own and operate the parking infrastructure, the incumbent
concessionaire is normally well positioned to negotiate an extension of the term of the concession (if permitted


-----

under the contract), or to obtain the renewal of the concession by using the information and experience it has
developed to bid successfully in the new public tender process.

In certain cases when new parking infrastructure is constructed, the municipality may require the concessionaire
to sell some parking spaces in the facility to local residents who typically pay the concessionaire the acquisition
price of the parking space in one single payment. We recognize revenues for the sale of parking spaces at the
time the parking space is sold, which coincides with the time at which the relevant contract is signed. These
spaces are usually sold at a discount compared to the market value and allow the purchaser to use the parking
space for the remaining duration of our concession agreement. The purchaser of the parking space is required to
pay us a periodic fee for maintenance.

In addition to retaining our existing concessions once their initial term has expired, we also seek to obtain new
concessions and win renewals from our competitors. For new projects, we engage a third party construction
company under a competitive bidding process to build the parking facility. We completed our capital program in
2012, which involved the construction of eight large parking facilities and a total capital expenditure for the period
2010 to 2012 of approximately €81.5 million. The largest of these investments were the construction of an offstreet parking facility in Oquendo (San Sebastian, Spain) that was completed in May 2010, an off-street parking
facility in La Concha (San Sebastian, Spain) that was completed in July 2011 and an off-street parking facility in
Plaza de Cataluña (San Sebastian, Spain) that was completed in June 2011. As of September 30, 2013, we had
approximately €6.3 million in outstanding capital commitments for constructing new car parks, of which we expect
to invest approximately €2.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 and the remainder in 2014.
**On-street concessions**

Our on-street concession business is our second largest business line, representing 22.1% of Adjusted EBITDA
for the twelve months ended September 30, 2013 and having a Weighted average remaining duration of
approximately seven years. As of September 30, 2013, we operated 139 on-street concessions consisting of over
215,600 parking spaces in practically all major Spanish and Portuguese cities. We have been a concessionaire in
a number of cities, including Madrid, Valencia and Lisbon, since the introduction of controlled on-street parking.

Under our on-street concessions, we primarily manage on-street meter-controlled parking spaces for
municipalities. Depending on the needs of the client and the terms of the concession, we provide a variety of
additional services, which can include: collecting revenue from meters; maintaining ticket dispensing machines;
monitoring parking ordinances (including ticketing or wheel clamping); and managing complaints and appeals.
Under some of our on-street concessions, we also provide vehicle removal services. We are not responsible for
the enforcement of fines and our remuneration is not linked to enforcement.

On-street concessions are typically awarded through public tenders. Under the terms of the concession, we are
generally required to make an initial investment which can consist of a lump-sum payment to the municipality and
the acquisition and installment of the on-street parking control equipment, such as parking meters and other
devices related to the monitoring of the parking meters. In exchange, we typically receive fixed fees that are
inflation-indexed and which cover the yearly amortized amount of our initial investment and operating costs. In a
number of concessions which have a fixed fee, the contract also includes a variable incentive element (which may
be based on a percentage of the collected meter receipts, the number of parking spaces or certain other quality
indicators) to align the concessionaire’s objectives with optimizing revenue collection. We believe that there is low
demand risk in most of these contracts since the bulk of our remuneration is fixed and our base fee is typically not
dependent on the amount of money collected. Even for those on-street concessions under which our
remuneration is dependent on collected revenues, we believe our exposure to demand risk is relatively low, as
the demand for on-street spaces tends to be greater than the limited supply of on-street parking spaces, even
during periods of relatively low demand.

Under a majority of our on-street concessions, the municipality receives the parking revenues generated by those
concessions and remits the relevant concession fee to us. As a result, we are exposed to the credit risk of the
applicable municipalities with respect to these concessions.

We operate our on-street concessions with our own employees. The operation of on-street concessions is more
labor intensive than our off-street concession operations. Accordingly, we have introduced a number of
technological innovations in order to more efficiently manage the area covered by our on-street concessions.

Our on-street concession contracts are usually for an initial term of approximately five to seven years, and some
agreements include extensions for an additional period under the same contractual terms. Recently,
municipalities have increased the duration for certain on-street concessions put to a tender process in exchange
for higher initial fee payments payable by the concessionaire. For example, we have an on-street concession with
a term of 20 years in Huelva. We also have an on-street concession which runs for 15 years in Huesca and in


-----

Madrid we recently won an on-street concession which runs for 12 years. Upon expiration of an on-street
concession, we are usually obliged to transfer to the municipality the ownership of the assets allocated to the
operation of the concession, such as parking meters, signage, towing equipment or other vehicles. Likewise, in
connection with the transfer of a concession at the end of its term, any of our employees assigned to that
concession will be transferred to the new operator, which will, by operation of law, be subrogated to our position
as employer in respect of such transferred employees. The same will apply when we win or acquire a concession
previously operated by one of our competitors.
The following table sets forth the number of on-street concessions we have renewed and won from our
competitors and the number of new contracts awarded to us, in each case compared to the number of bids we
submitted in each of the foregoing categories.

**Total**

**since**
**On-street concessions** **2010**

**Renewals**

Bids................................................................. 49
Renewed ........................................................ 39

**% of success** ..................................................... **80%**

**Won from competitors**

Awarded ......................................................... 10

**% of success** ..................................................... **36%**

**New contracts**

Bids................................................................. 32
Awarded ......................................................... 20

**% of success** ..................................................... **63%**

As shown above, since the beginning of 2010 we have renewed approximately 80% of the on-street contracts for
which we submitted bids, we won approximately 63% of the new on-street contracts for which we submitted bids,
and we won approximately 36% of the expiring on-street contracts for which we submitted bids and that were
previously operated by our competitors. We believe we have been able to achieve these outcomes mainly as a
result of the high barriers to entry in the business, the limited number of major participants in the business, our
technical competence and our ability to offer more competitive terms than our competitors due to our ability to
realize significant synergies from our overall operations.

**Off-Street Contract Management**

Our off-street contract management business is our smallest business line, which represented 12.6% of Adjusted
Revenue and had Adjusted EBITDA of €(0.4) million in the twelve months ended September 30, 2013. As of
September 30, 2013, we managed over 64,200 parking spaces in Spain, Portugal and the United Kingdom (our
total net turnover from the United Kingdom was €7.0 million or 3.9% of net turnover in 2012 through our off-street
contract management business), primarily at airports, including those serving Madrid, Lisbon, London (Stansted),
Edinburgh, Barcelona, Oporto and Santiago de Compostela. This business line also generates a small amount of
net turnover derived from providing operational and administrative assistance to other third parties in respect of
their concessions.

Our off-street management contracts are generally for shorter terms than our concession arrangements, generally
ranging from one to three years. However, in some cases we have entered into off-street management contracts
for up to five years plus two additional extensions of one year each at the discretion of the customer, as is the
case with our new contract with AENA to manage airport parking facilities on its behalf. Likewise, our off-street
management contracts generally generate lower Adjusted EBITDA margins compared to our off-street
concessions. However, these contracts require minimal investment and are not subject to significant demand risk.
Our two main clients with respect to our off-street contract management business are AENA and ANA, the
Spanish and Portuguese public airport operators, respectively. We also manage park-and-ride car parks.

Under our off-street management contracts, we operate parking facilities in exchange for a fixed fee, which is
generally inflation-indexed. In some limited cases, the contracts also include a variable incentive fee element
based on the amount of revenue generated and certain other quality indicators. We do not make an up-front
payment to manage the facilities and we are not required to make significant investments in the parking


-----

infrastructure. We typically operate the parking facility with our own employees. We utilize the expertise and
technology from our off-street concession operations in the management of these contracts.

The legislation governing off-street and on-street concessions is not applicable to our off-street management
contracts, so there is no ability to apply for economic rebalancing in these contracts.

**Rebalancing Provisions in Off-street and On-street Concessions**

Our off-street and on-street concessions in Spain and Portugal are primarily governed by administrative laws
similar to the laws that regulate highway and road infrastructure concessions in Spain and Portugal. These
concessions typically include a rebalancing clause which provides that, in certain cases, if the fundamental
economic balance that existed when the contract was awarded has changed to the disadvantage of the
concessionaire, the concessionaire can demand fair compensation from the public authority that granted the
concession. See “Regulation—Spain —Concept of Economic-Financial Rebalancing” and “—Portugal—
_Economic—Financial Balance”._

The changes that can give rise to a claim for compensation include the adoption of administrative measures or
other non-contractual and extraordinary causes that were unforeseen at the time the contract was made, which
affect the long-term economic benefit of the contract in a material way to the detriment of the concessionaire. For
example, a permanent road closure that adversely impacts the flow of traffic with respect to the location of the
concession may trigger a rebalancing of the concession terms. The compensation granted by the public authority
can include, depending on the circumstances, an extension of the concession term (subject to the maximum legal
term) or an increase in the tariffs chargeable to customers or paid by the contracting authorities (for on-street
concessions, when applicable). If applicable, the public authority may grant additional parking spaces under the
existing concession or another change of the economic terms of the concession contract between the municipality
and us. The application of the rebalancing clause is not an automatic procedure and the compensation granted
will vary on a case by case basis.

We have obtained such adjustments to our concessions and contracts on a number of occasions. In Portugal, for
example, an amendment was agreed and executed with the municipality of Faro in relation to a concession
contract for on-street parking. Under this agreement, the terms and conditions of the initial contract were modified
to compensate for the tariff modifications imposed by the awarding entity. Additionally, in certain concessions we
have been granted additional parking spaces in our on-street contract when the municipality permanently closed
certain streets to traffic.

**New Concessions and Investments**

In 2012, we completed our capital expenditure program. Since the beginning of 2010, we have completed the
construction of several large off-street parking facilities, including Oquendo (San Sebastian, Spain) in May 2010,
La Concha (San Sebastian, Spain) in July 2011 and Plaza de Cataluña (San Sebastian, Spain) in June 2011. In
2013, we acquired a parking facility in Lisbon, Portugal (Baixa Chiado), and three smaller parking facilities have
been constructed and become operational in Portugal (Alves Redol) and Spain (Ponferrada and Pamplona). We
expect our Don Luis I parking facility in Lisbon will commence operations in 2014. The revenue and Adjusted
EBITDA generated by new parking facilities gradually ramp up over the first three to four years after they become
operational, and then remain fairly stable with, in most cases, moderate increases due to inflation adjustments
and volume increases (largely reflecting increased demand due to traffic increases in cities) for the remaining
term of the concession.

We have a well-established and disciplined process for evaluating potential new concessions and other
investment opportunities. We maintain an investment committee comprising members of our senior management
team that reviews and evaluates all concession tenders where we consider submitting a bid. When evaluating a
potential opportunity, the committee considers targeted investment returns, the proposed financial models,
expected consumer demand for the parking facility, potential risks and possible economies of scale with existing
concession investments. Our investment committee supervises our business development department, which is
dedicated to the preparation of studies, project design and bid documentation for tenders for new concessions
and the evaluation of potential acquisitions of existing concessions and concession operators. Our business
development department works closely with our regional business units in the evaluation process. We believe that
this dedicated approach allows us to evaluate and respond in a timely and efficient matter to potential business
opportunities.

In general, the tender process for a new concession requires the preparation and submission of three categories
of documentation: documentation demonstrating that the bidder meets the legal and technical requirements to


-----

participate in the tender; documentation outlining the proposed economic terms of the bid, including fees payable
to the public authority and the tariffs charged to end users; and the technical specifications for the development
and operation of the parking infrastructure.

Generally, bids for off-street concessions and off-street management contracts are the most competitive, focusing
primarily on price and other economic terms. Bids for on-street concessions tend to be less competitive, as there
are often a limited number of potential operators, and they tend to focus on the technical specifications of the
concession and the demonstrated experience of the bidder. Once the term of the contract expires (including the
possible extensions, which cannot go beyond the maximum term provided by law for such concessions), it cannot
be renewed without a prior public tender process. For off-street contract management, each entity awarding the
contract may have its own awarding process and selection criteria, but it will generally be required to follow public
bidding rules.

**Joint Ventures**

For some of our concessions we have entered into joint venture arrangements (including special purpose
companies and temporary consortiums) with local minority partners for the purpose of satisfying certain specific
tender requirements or to take advantage of local market experience and knowledge. We typically do this through
“ring-fenced” non-recourse financing arrangements. As of September 30, 2013, we operated several majority held
joint ventures, and also held minority interests in joint ventures where the local municipality requires that it holds a
majority stake in the concessionaire.
Set forth below are certain entities in which we held an ownership interest of 50% or less as of September 30,
2013:

**Property**

We lease our main corporate offices in Madrid and Lisbon. We also lease regional offices in Spain and maintain
offices in the United Kingdom, Andorra and Turkey.

As described in “Regulation”, upon the expiration of the term of the concession, unless the concession is
renewed, the parking infrastructure reverts to the public authority that granted the concession.


-----

**Suppliers**

Historically, our primary suppliers have been construction companies and contractors who build our off-street
parking facilities. We also rely on suppliers of parking meter equipment and information technology. For parking
meter equipment, we fulfill our requirements from a limited number of international suppliers. For information
technology, we purchase from a variety of suppliers. Additionally, we outsource part of our information technology
needs and certain other limited services, including operating shuttle buses to and from our parking lots at airports.
We are not dependent on any single supplier.

**Clients**

We have two groups of clients. The first group comprises the parties with which we enter into concessions or offstreet contract management arrangements. The second group comprises the end users or customers.

Our client base with whom we enter into concessions or off-street contract management agreements includes
municipalities, semi-public entities and private companies. As of September 30, 2013, we had 172 off-street
concessions with 76 municipalities, 139 on-street concessions with 125 municipalities and off-street management
contracts with customers such as AENA and ANA. We manage our relationships with these clients on a
centralized, regional and local basis. In general, the same personnel that manage our contracts on an ongoing
basis are responsible for maintaining relationships with our clients. A number of our off-street and on-street
concessions are managed by personnel who have developed long-standing relationships with the municipalities
and private entities with whom we enter into concession management agreements.

The second group of clients we have are the end users that utilize the car parks that we operate. We are focused
on providing end users with a car park service that is high quality, easy to use, safe and efficient. We concentrate
on the image of our car parks by ensuring that our car parks are up to date, safe and convenient places for end
users.

**Information Technology**

We believe that automation and technology can enhance customer convenience, lower labor costs, improve cash
management and increase overall profitability. We have introduced a number of automation and technology
based services to the parking industry in recent years and have developed a proprietary set of in-house
information technology applications to optimize the utilization of internal resources and increase the quality of the
services provided. In our off-street concessions, we have centralized management which is controlled remotely
from a single 24-hour hub. As of September 30, 2013, approximately 73% of our car parks were equipped with
these systems.

**Employees**

As of September 30, 2013, we employed 2,917 individuals. As of December 31, 2012, we employed
approximately 2,914 individuals. Most of our employees in Spain are represented by a number of different labor
unions.

We believe that our relations with employees are satisfactory. We have occasionally experienced strikes and work
stoppages. However, such strikes and work stoppages have historically not had a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition or results of operations.

**Insurance**

We purchase comprehensive liability insurance covering certain claims that can occur at the parking facilities that
we operate. As is customary, these policies have deductibles that must be paid before the insurance companies
are required to reimburse us for costs and liabilities relating to covered claims. We also have directors and
officers insurance as well as life and personal insurance for our employees. We believe that our insurance
coverage, including the maximum coverage amounts and terms and conditions of the insurance policies, are both
standard for our industry and appropriate. We cannot, however, guarantee that we will not incur any losses or be
the subject of claims that exceed the scope of the relevant insurance coverage.

**Competition**

We face competition from other parking operators in the bidding process for off-street and on-street concessions
and contracts. We also face this competition when our concessions and contracts come up for renewal and when
we bid on concessions of others which are coming up for renewal. As the largest concessionaire of off-street and


-----

on-street parking in the Iberian Peninsula and due to our long-standing relationships with a diverse number of
local authorities, we believe that we are well positioned compared to our competitors. Since the Weighted
average remaining duration of our off-street concessions and contracts is approximately 28 years, we face limited
competition in the near future to maintain our off-street portfolio. Generally, the competition to obtain off-street
concessions is more intense than for on-street concessions. Additionally, there are several barriers to entry to
obtain new concessions, in particular for on-street concessions. These barriers to entry include having the
relevant administrative qualifications, relevant experience and technology.

Our parking facilities face competition for end users with nearby parking options. In general, we believe end users
are not willing to park more than a short walk from their intended destination so competition is generally based on
location and proximity to a customer’s intended location. However, we may face competition from parking
structures built nearby. We believe this competition is normally limited since many of our off-street parking
facilities have limited direct competition within easy walking distance and the risk of new structures being built is
mitigated by the cost and difficulty of developing new parking facilities in city centers due to the high density and
planning regulations. For our on-street concessions, the terms of the concessions provide us with exclusivity
within the areas covered by the relevant concession, subject to parking allocated to local residents.

**Legal Proceedings**

We are party to various legal proceedings involving routine claims that are incidental to our business. Although
our legal and financial liability with respect to such proceedings cannot be estimated with certainty, we do not
believe that the outcome of these legal proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

# Related Party Transactions

We have in the past from time to time entered into transactions with certain of our officers, directors and
shareholders and other entities in which certain of our officers, directors and shareholders hold ownership
interests. These transactions include, among others, financing arrangements, shareholder arrangements and
commercial arrangements. We also have in the past entered into transactions with entities that may be deemed to
be affiliates because the Group holds less than a majority ownership interest in such entities. The following
discussion is a brief summary of certain of the significant arrangements, agreements and transactions we have
with such related parties.

**Shareholders Agreement**

Certain of our shareholders are parties to a Shareholders Agreement. See “Major Shareholders—Shareholders
_Agreement”. Under the Shareholders Agreement, the shareholders are, among other things, entitled to appoint_
members of the Board of Directors of Empark as well as of entities controlled by Empark.

Additionally, in connection with the Shareholders Agreement, A. Silva & Silva—Imobiliário e Serviços, S.A.
(“ASSIS”), an affiliate of ASSIP, provides certain services to Empark, including assistance in preparing all
documents and procedures concerning the consolidated financial statements, tax consultancy and advice, legal
and contractual advice, management of common auditing services, providing administrative support as to the
management of the Group’s fleet, negotiation of supply contracts, negotiation of insurance coverage,
management of IT services, marketing and other similar services where a centralized group management can
provide scale economies and synergies.

As remuneration for such services, ASSIS is entitled to a monthly fee which is subject to increase on an annual
basis upon proposal from ASSIS and approval by our board of directors, prior recommendation of the chief
executive officer (for the avoidance of doubt, the directors nominated by ASSIP would not be entitled to vote such
proposal). For the year ended December 31, 2012, Empark paid to ASSIS a fee of €1.1 million.

**Management Service Agreements with ASSIP**

Empark and Emparque each have management services agreements with ASSIP—Consultoria e Serviços S.A.
(“ASSIP”), our largest shareholder. Under these agreements, ASSIP provides technical, financial, technical
engineering and operational advisory services and expertise to both Empark and Emparque. Under the
agreements, ASSIP charges a fee based on the total hours involved. In the year ended December 31, 2012, the
fee paid to ASSIP was €1.1 million for the services rendered to Empark and €0.5 million for the services rendered
to Emparque. In the nine months ended September 30, 2013, we paid a fee of €0.5 million to ASSIP pursuant to
the agreement with Empark and a fee of €0.3 million pursuant to the agreement with Emparque. The contracts
began on January 1, 2010, and are automatically renewed each year, unless terminated by either party with 180
days’ notice before the expiration of the period.

**Lease Agreement for Lisbon corporate headquarters**

We lease our corporate headquarters in Lisbon from Assimec-Imóveis e Construções de A. Silva & Silva, S.A.
(“Assimec”), an affiliate of ASSIP—Consultoria e Serviços S.A., our largest shareholder. Pursuant to the lease,
which commenced on November 4, 2002, we pay €0.1 million in rent per year, which is adjusted annually. For the
year ended December 31, 2012, we paid €0.2 million for the lease of our Lisbon office. We have made an
advance payment to Assimec of €1.8 million in
connection with an option to acquire the office space, which we are accounting for as a receivable until such time
as Assimec determines whether to sell the premises to us or not.
**Shareholder Loans to Empark**

In connection with the acquisition of Empark in July 2009, our shareholders which, collectively own approximately
99.9% of our shares, made a subordinated loan to Empark for a total amount of approximately €0.5 million with a
term of one year, subject to automatic renewals for successive one year periods, unless otherwise indicated in
writing by Empark to the shareholders on one month’s prior notice. Interest accrues on the loan at a rate of
8% per annum plus 1% of the positive net profits of Empark and is payable on the termination date of the
agreement or any of its extensions. As of September 30, 2013, the principal amount outstanding was €0.8 million.

**Cash Contribution and Issuer Intercompany Loan**

On or about the Issue Date, Empark will make an equity contribution in cash to the Issuer for an amount of
€2.0 million (the “Cash Contribution”), which Cash Contribution will be made in accordance with the terms and
conditions of a contribution agreement to be entered into between the Issuer and Empark. The Issuer intends to
lend to Empark an amount equal to the Cash Contribution pursuant to the terms of the Issuer Intercompany Loan
Agreement to be entered into between the Issuer and Empark on or about the Issue Date.

# Description of Other Indebtedness

_The following is a summary of the material terms of our principal financing arrangements in addition to the_
_Indenture after giving effect to the Refinancing. The following summaries do not purport to describe all of the_
_applicable terms and conditions of such arrangements and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the actual_
_agreements. Capitalized terms used in the following summaries and not otherwise defined in this offering_
_memorandum have the meanings ascribed to them in their respective agreements._

**Revolving Credit Facility Agreement**

**Overview and structure**

On or prior to the Issue Date, among others, (1) Empark, (2) J.P. Morgan Limited and other financial institutions
named therein as mandated lead arrangers, (3) the financial institutions named therein as original lenders (the
“Lenders”), (4) Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch as agent (the “Agent”) and (5) the Security Agent will enter
into the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement provides for borrowings up to an aggregate principal amount of
€30.0 million on a committed basis. The Revolving Credit Facility may be utilized by any current or future
borrower (subject to certain exceptions) under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement in euro by the drawing of
cash advances. Subject to certain exceptions, loans may be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed at any time during
the availability period. Borrowings will be available to be used for general corporate and working capital purposes
of the Group, provided that no amount borrowed under the Revolving Credit Facility may be used directly or
indirectly for the prepayment, repayment, purchase, defeasance, discharge or redemption of any Notes, any pari
passu debt liabilities or any other financial indebtedness of any member of the Group with a scheduled maturity
date six months or more from the date on which such financial indebtedness was incurred or of any debt of the
Non-Recourse Entities.

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement also provides for an uncommitted accordion facility pursuant to which
Empark may request by notice of not less than 15 business days that the commitments under the Revolving
Credit Facility are increased by an aggregate principal amount not exceeding €10.0 million. There is no obligation
on any lender under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement to provide or commit to any of the requested
increases in commitments.

**Availability**

The Revolving Credit Facility may, subject to satisfaction of customary conditions precedent, be utilized from the
Issue Date until the date falling one month prior to the maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.

**Borrowers and Guarantors**

Empark is an original borrower and original guarantor under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. A
mechanism is included in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement to enable certain of its subsidiaries to accede
as borrowers under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement subject to certain conditions. The Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement also requires that in the future each Material Company (which definition includes, among other
things, any member of the Group that has EBITDA representing 5% or more of EBITDA or gross assets
(excluding intra-Group items) representing 5% or more of the gross assets of the Group) becomes a guarantor
(subject to agreed security principles).
**Maturity and Repayment Requirements**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement matures on the date falling five years and six months from the date on
which the Notes are issued (the “Closing Date”). Each advance will be repaid on the last day of the interest period
relating thereto, subject to a netting mechanism against amounts to be drawn on such date. All outstanding
amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility must be repaid in full on or prior to the maturity date for the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement. Amounts repaid by the borrowers on loans made under the Revolving Credit Facility
may be reborrowed during the availability period, subject to certain conditions.

**Interest Rate and Fees**

The interest rate on cash advances under the Revolving Credit Facility will be the rate per annum equal to the
aggregate of the applicable margin and EURIBOR (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement). The


-----

initial margin under the Revolving Credit Facility will be 3.50%. Beginning from the date which falls twelve months
from the Closing Date, the margin on the loans will be reduced if certain leverage ratios (being the ratio of our
Total Net Debt to EBITDA) are met.

A commitment fee will be payable on the aggregate undrawn and uncancelled amount of the Revolving Credit
Facility from the Closing Date to (and including) the last day of the availability period for the Revolving Credit
Facility at a rate of 40% of the then applicable margin for the Revolving Credit Facility. The commitment fee will
be payable quarterly in arrears, on the last day of the availability period of the Revolving Credit Facility and on the
date on which a lender cancels its commitment. No commitment fee shall be payable unless the Closing Date
occurs.

Default interest will be calculated as an additional 1% on the overdue amount.

Empark is also required to pay customary agency fees to the agent and the security agent in connection with the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.

**Guarantees**

Subject to certain guarantee limitations, Empark will provide a guarantee of all amounts payable to the Agent, the
Arranger, the Security Agent or a Lender under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement or a hedge counterparty
(a “Hedge Counterparty”) under the Intercreditor Agreement (together, the “Finance Parties”) by any of its
subsidiaries which accedes to the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement as an additional borrower or an additional
guarantor and to the hedging banks under certain secured hedging agreements.

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement requires that (subject to agreed security principles) each subsidiary of
Empark that is, or becomes, a Material Company following the Closing Date will be required to become a
guarantor under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.

Empark is required to ensure that the guarantors represent not less than 90% of EBITDA (excluding that of any
Non-Recourse Entity) and consolidated gross assets of the Group (excluding that of any Non- Recourse Entity),
calculated by reference to the most recent annual financial statements of the Group (the “Guarantor Coverage
_Test”)._

**Security**

The initial security provided for the Revolving Credit Facility is described under the heading “Ranking and Priority”
in the summary of the Intercreditor Agreement set forth below. In addition, each holding company of any Material
Company which becomes a guarantor under the Revolving Credit Facility is required (subject to agreed security
principles) to grant security over the shares in such Material Company in favor of the Security Agent.
Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, proceeds from the enforcement of the relevant collateral (whether
or not shared with the holders of the Notes) will be required to be applied to repay indebtedness outstanding
under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement in priority to the Notes.

**Representations and warranties**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains certain customary representations and warranties, subject to
certain customary materiality, actual knowledge and other qualifications, exceptions and baskets, and with certain
representations and warranties being repeated, including: (i) status and incorporation; (ii) binding obligations;
(iii) non-conflict with constitutional documents, laws or other obligations; (iv) power and authority; (v) validity and
admissibility in evidence; (vi) governing law and enforcement; (vii) no default; (viii) accuracy of most recent
financial statements delivered; (ix) anti-corruption laws and sanctions; (x) ranking; (xi) good title to assets;
(xii) legal and beneficial ownership; and (xiii) center of main interests and establishments.

**Covenants**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains certain of the same incurrence covenants and related
definitions (with certain adjustments) that apply to the Notes. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement
also contains certain affirmative and negative covenants. Set forth below is a brief description of such covenants,
all of which are subject to customary materiality, actual knowledge or other qualifications, exceptions and baskets.

**_Notes Purchase Condition_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement requires that if an amount of Notes, Pari Passu Debt (as defined in the
Intercreditor Agreement) or Term Debt which equals or is greater than 35% or more of the aggregate amount of


-----

the Notes issued at the Closing Date are repurchased or repaid, the Revolving Credit Facility will be permanently
cancelled and repaid on a matching pro rata basis.

**_Affirmative Covenants_**

The affirmative covenants include, among others: (i) providing certain financial information, including annual
audited and quarterly financial statements, compliance certificates and an annual budget; (ii) authorizations;
(iii) compliance with laws and regulations; (iv) environmental compliance; (v) payment of taxes; (vi) preservation
of assets; (vii) maintenance of pari passu ranking; (viii) maintenance of intellectual property; (ix) maintenance of

business of the Group and (ii) repayment of subordinated and structural intra-group loans. Otherwise, the
negative covenants in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement are substantially the same as the negative
covenants in the Indenture.

**_Mandatory Prepayment Requirements upon a Change of Control_**

On a Change of Control (as defined in the “Description of the Notes,” provided that an “Affiliate” for the purpose of
the definition of “Change of Control” in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement
will be deemed amended by the deletion of the following: “provided that beneficial ownership of 10% or more of
the Voting Stock of a Person will be deemed control”), if a Lender so requires, the Agent shall cancel the
Commitment of that Lender and declare the Participation of that Lender in all outstanding utilizations, together
with accrued interest, and all other amounts accrued under the Finance Documents immediately due and
payable.”
**_Financial Covenant_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will require Empark to comply with a financial covenant. The ratio is
based on the definitions in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, which may differ from similar definitions in the
Indenture and the equivalent definitions described in this offering memorandum. Breach of the financial covenant
acts as a drawstop (subject to equity cure provisions in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement).

**_Adjusted Leverage_**

The ratio of Total Net Debt on any quarter date specified in Column 1 below to EBITDA in respect of the relevant
measurement period of 12 months ending on that quarter date shall not be less than the ratio set out in Column 2
opposite the expiry date for that relevant measurement period.

customary materiality and other qualifications, exceptions, baskets and/or grace periods, as appropriate,
including: (i) failure to pay any principal or interest when due subject to a three business day grace period (in the

**Intercreditor Agreement**

To establish the relative rights of the Senior Secured Creditors (as defined below), the Issuer and any future

of the Group that accede to the Intercreditor Agreement in the future (collectively, the “Obligors”), the Intra-Group
Lenders (as defined below) and the Shareholder Subordinated Lenders (as defined below), all of such parties will
enter into an intercreditor agreement dated on or about the Issue Date. By accepting a Note, the relevant holder
thereof shall be deemed to have agreed to, and accepted the terms and conditions of, the Intercreditor Agreement
and shall be deemed to have authorized the Trustee to enter into the Intercreditor Agreement on its behalf. The
following description is a summary of certain provisions, among others, that will be contained in the Intercreditor
Agreement and which relate to the rights and obligations of the holders of the Notes. It does not restate the
Intercreditor Agreement in its entirety. As such, you are urged to read the Intercreditor Agreement because it, and
not the description that follows, defines certain rights of the holders of the Notes. Unless expressly stated
otherwise in the Intercreditor Agreement, in the event of a conflict between the terms of the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement, the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement
will prevail.

**Overview**

The Intercreditor Agreement sets out, among other things:

- the relative ranking of certain debt of Empark and the Issuer and certain of their subsidiaries in respect of
Revolving Credit Facility liabilities (or any replacement thereof), the Fixed Rate Note liabilities, the Floating
Rate Note liabilities, the Super Senior Hedging Liabilities (as defined below), the Pari Passu Hedging Liabilities
(as defined below), the Intra-Group Liabilities (as defined below) and the Subordinated Debt Liabilities (as
defined below);

- the ranking of the Transaction Security (as defined below) in respect of liabilities under various classes of debt;

- when payments can be made in respect of certain indebtedness of the Group;

- when enforcement action (including acceleration and/or demand for payment and certain similar actions)
(“Enforcement Action”) can be taken in respect of the Transaction Security;

- the terms pursuant to which certain indebtedness will be subordinated upon the occurrence of certain
insolvency events;

- the requirement to turnover amounts received from enforcement of the Transaction Security;

- when the Transaction Security and any guarantee(s) issued by certain Obligors will be released to permit an
enforcement sale;


-----

- the circumstances in which creditors’ claims (including noteholders’ claims against the Issuer) might be
required to be transferred to third parties or released to assist in enforcement; and

- the order for applying proceeds from the enforcement of the Transaction Security and other amounts received
by the Security Agent (as defined in “Description of the Notes”).

**Parties**

The senior secured creditors (together with those mentioned below, the “Senior Secured Creditors”) will include
(1) the agent under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (the “Senior Agent”), the Security Agent, the lenders
under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement or any Future Credit Facilities (as defined below) (together the
“Credit Facility Lenders”), the arrangers under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement; and (2) the Trustee for the
holders of the Notes.
The Intercreditor Agreement will also allow for accession by, among others, (1) creditors of future loan or bond
indebtedness (the “Future Pari Passu Debt”) of the Obligors (which is permitted by or not restricted under the
terms of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Notes), including any senior secured notes issued after
the Issue Date pursuant to the Indenture (“Additional Notes”) which are secured on a pari passu basis, (2) hedge
counterparties party to interest rate hedging agreements in respect of interest rate hedging of the Floating Rate
Notes (the agreements documenting such hedging being the “Super Senior Hedging Agreements” and the
providers of such hedging the “Super Senior Hedging Banks”), (3) hedge counterparties party to interest rate or
foreign exchange hedging agreements referred to below (the agreements documenting such hedging being the
“Pari Passu Hedging Agreements” and the providers of such hedging the “Pari Passu Hedging Banks”), and
(4) after the expiry of the Revolving Credit Facility, creditors who provide certain credit facilities (“Future Credit
_Facilities”) subject to the terms set out in the Intercreditor Agreement, on a super senior basis. Providers of Future_
Credit Facilities and Future Pari Passu Debt and the Super Senior Hedging Banks and Pari Passu Hedging Banks
are also “Senior Secured Creditors”. The debt owed to Senior Secured Creditors is together referred to as “Senior
_Secured Debt”. There will be a single Security Agent appointed to act at all times on behalf of all Senior Secured_
Creditors.

Neither the Issuer, nor Empark, nor any of their subsidiaries (each a member of the “Group”) nor shareholder of a
member of the Group which is not otherwise party to (1) a document creating security in favor of the Senior
Secured Creditors or (2) the debt documents thereby secured, will be party to the Intercreditor Agreement save
for (i) any shareholder of the Parent in respect of any existing or future loan made to the Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries (each a “Shareholder Subordinated Lender”) (and the Intercreditor Agreement will contain customary
subordination provisions and restrictions relating to the receivables owing from any member of the Group to any
Shareholder Subordinated Lender (the “Subordinated Debt Liabilities”)), (ii) certain members of the Group that
lend to certain other members of the Group (each an “Intra-Group Lender”) that will accede to the Intercreditor
Agreement as lenders under such intra-Group loans (the “Intra-Group Liabilities”); and (iii) certain intra-Group
debtors. The Intercreditor Agreement will contain subordination provisions relating to any Intra-Group Liabilities.
However, borrowers under Intra-Group Liabilities will not be prohibited from incurring, amending or making
payments in respect of any Intra-Group Liabilities until an acceleration event under the Revolving Credit Facility or
the Indenture is continuing.

**Ranking and Priority**

**_Priority of Indebtedness_**

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the liabilities of the Obligors, as the case may be, in respect of the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (or any Future Credit Facilities) (together the “Revolving Credit Facility
_Liabilities”), the Notes (the “Notes Liabilities”), the Future Pari Passu Debt (the “Future Pari Passu Debt_
_Liabilities”), the amounts owing to the Super Senior Hedging Banks under the Super Senior Hedging Agreements_
(the “Super Senior Hedging Liabilities”) and the amounts owing to the Pari Passu Hedging Banks under the Pari
Passu Hedging Agreements (the “Pari Passu Hedging Liabilities”), and certain customary costs and expenses of
the Note Trustee (the “Trustee Liabilities”) and other creditor representative liabilities will rank equally (without
preference among them) in right and priority of payment and in priority to the liabilities of the Obligors, as the case
may be, in respect of the Intra-Group Liabilities and the Subordinated Debt Liabilities.

**_Priority of Security_**

The Intercreditor Agreement shall provide that the security described in the “Description of the Notes” (the
“Transaction Security”) shall rank and secure (only to the extent that such security is expressed to secure the
relevant liabilities) (and subject to the proceeds of such security being distributed in accordance with the


-----

Payments Waterfall (as defined below)) the Revolving Credit Facility Liabilities, the Super Senior Hedging
Liabilities, the Notes Liabilities, the Future Pari Passu Debt Liabilities, the Trustee Liabilities and the Pari Passu
Hedging Liabilities pari passu and without any prejudice between them.

**Payments and Prepayments**

Prior to the occurrence of an acceleration event in respect of any Revolving Credit Facility Liabilities, Notes
Liabilities or Future Pari Passu Debt Liabilities, the Obligors may make payments and (where applicable)
prepayments in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility Liabilities, the Super Senior Hedging Liabilities, the Pari
Passu Hedging Liabilities, and the Notes Liabilities at any time in accordance with their terms and may prepay or
acquire the Notes subject to compliance with any conditions relating to purchases of Notes described in the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Indenture.

**Enforcement by Holders of Secured Debt**

Prior to the date upon which all Revolving Credit Facility Liabilities and the Super Senior Hedging Liabilities are
fully discharged and paid in full and all commitments thereunder are irrevocably cancelled (the “Super Senior
_Discharge Date”), the Security Agent will act on the instructions of (i) the Credit Facility Lenders and the Super_
Senior Hedging Banks whose super senior credit participations represent more than 66 [2]/3% of the aggregate
super senior credit participations of all Credit Facility Lenders and the Super Senior Hedging Banks (the “Majority
_Super Senior Creditors”) and/or (ii) the holders of the Notes, holders of Future Pari Passu Debt and the Pari_
Passu Hedging Banks (the “Pari Passu Creditors”) whose aggregate senior secured credit participations
represent more than 50% of the aggregate senior secured credit participations of all such creditors (the “Majority
_Senior Secured Creditors”), in each case provided that such instructions are consistent with the security_
enforcement principles set forth below. Following the Super Senior Discharge Date, the Security Agent will act on
the instructions of the Pari Passu Creditors (including the holders of the Notes) whose senior secured credit
participations represent more than 50% of the aggregate senior secured credit participations of all such creditors.

**Enforcement Procedure**

Prior to giving any instructions to the Security Agent to commence enforcement of all or part of the Transaction
Security and/or the requesting of a distressed disposal and/or the release or disposal of claims or Transaction
Security on a distressed disposal (an “Enforcement”), the relevant representative of holders of the Senior Secured
Debt shall notify (via the Security Agent) the other Senior Secured Debt representatives of the intention to enforce
the Transaction Security (the “Enforcement Notice”).

Subject to the paragraphs below, the Security Agent will act in accordance with enforcement instructions received
from the Majority Senior Secured Creditors.

If the Majority Senior Secured Creditors have not either:

(a) made a determination as to the method of Enforcement they wish to instruct the Security Agent to pursue
(and notified the Security Agent of that determination in writing); or

(b) appointed a Financial Adviser (as defined below) to assist them in making such a determination,

(the “Minimum Enforcement Action”) within three months of the date of the Enforcement Notice then the Security
Agent will act in accordance with enforcement instructions received from the Majority Super Senior Creditors until
the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred. In addition, if the Super Senior Discharge Date has not occurred
within six months of the date of the Enforcement Notice, then the Security Agent will act in accordance with
enforcement instructions received from the Majority Super Senior Creditors.
If an insolvency event occurs with respect to an Obligor or a Material Company, then the Security Agent will, to
the extent the Majority Super Senior Creditors elect to provide such instructions, act in accordance with
enforcement instructions received from the Majority Super Senior Creditors until the Super Senior Discharge Date
has occurred.

If the Majority Senior Secured Creditors have not taken the Minimum Enforcement Action and the Majority Super
Senior Creditors (i) determine in good faith that a delay in issuing enforcement instructions could reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on the ability to effect a distressed disposal or on the expected
realization proceeds of any enforcement and (ii) deliver enforcement instructions which they reasonably believe to
be consistent with the Security Enforcement Principles as defined and outlined below before the Security Agent
has received instructions from the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, then the Security Agent will act in


-----

accordance with the enforcement instructions received from the Majority Super Senior Creditors until the Super
Senior Discharge Date has occurred.

**Security Enforcement Principles**

Enforcement of the Transaction Security must be conducted in accordance with the “Security Enforcement
_Principles”, which are summarized as follows:_

(a) It shall be the aim of any enforcement of the Transaction Security to maximize, so far as is consistent with a
prompt and expeditious realization of value from enforcement of the Transaction Security, within six months
of delivery of the Enforcement Notice, the value realized from the enforcement (and if the security
enforcement is over all or substantially all of the Group’s assets by virtue of either an asset or share sale, it
must reasonably be expected to realize sufficient proceeds to repay in full all amounts owing under the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) (the “Security Enforcement Objective”).

(b) The Security Enforcement Principles may be amended, varied or waived with the prior written consent of the
Security Agent, the Required Pari Passu Creditors (as defined below) and the Majority Super Senior
Creditors to the extent the amendment or waiver does not impose any obligations on the Group or any
Shareholder Subordinated Lender.

For the purposes of paragraph (b) above, “Required Pari Passu Creditors” means the Trustee on behalf of
holders of the Notes, each creditor representative of behalf of providers of the Future Pari Passu Debt and
Pari Passu Hedging Banks that hold hedge participations of more than 50% of the pari passu hedge
participations.

(c) Without prejudice to the Security Enforcement Objective, the Transaction Security will be enforced such that
either (1) all Enforcement Proceeds are received by the Security Agent in cash for distribution in accordance
with the Payments Waterfall; or (2) to the extent the instructing group are the Majority Senior Secured
Creditors, sufficient Enforcement Proceeds will be received by the Security Agent in cash to ensure that
when the proceeds are applied in accordance with the Payments Waterfall, the Super Senior Discharge
Date will occur.

(d) On (i) a proposed enforcement of any of the Transaction Security over assets other than shares in a
member of the Group, where the aggregate book or market value of such assets exceeds €1.0 million (or its
equivalent); or (ii) a proposed enforcement of any of the Transaction Security over some or all of the shares
in a member of the Group over which Transaction Security exists, the Security Agent shall (unless such
enforcement is made pursuant to a public auction) obtain an opinion from an independent internationally
recognized investment bank or independent internationally recognized accounting firm or (if is not
practicable for the Security Agent to make such an appointment on commercially reasonable terms) an
independent internationally recognized third-party professional services firm selected by the Security Agent,
which is regularly engaged in providing valuations in respect of the type of assets subject to enforcement
(any of them, a “Financial Advisor”) to provide an opinion that the proceeds received from enforcement are
reasonable from a financial point of view for a prompt and expeditious sale, taking into account all relevant
circumstances.
(e) The Security Agent shall be under no obligation to appoint a Financial Advisor or to seek the advice of a
Financial Advisor, unless expressly required to do so by the Intercreditor Agreement.

(f) Subject to certain limited exceptions, once the Security Agent has commenced any security enforcement it
shall not accept any subsequent instructions from anyone other than the original instructing group over the
assets directly or indirectly subject to such enforcement action, which assets shall include the assets of any
subsidiaries of a company the shares of which are subject to a sale process. Nevertheless, the Security
Agent may take subsequent instructions in relation to enforcement over other assets in accordance with the
enforcement process above.

**Turnover**


-----

The Intercreditor Agreement will also provide that if any holder of the Notes and/or Additional Notes receives or
recovers the proceeds of any enforcement of any Transaction Security or receives or recovers any payment or
distribution not permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement or applied other than in accordance with “Application
_of Proceeds/Waterfall” below that it shall (subject to certain prior actual knowledge qualifications in the case of the_
Trustee):

- in relation to receipts or recoveries not received or recovered by way of set-off, (i) hold that amount on trust for
the Security Agent and promptly pay that amount or an amount equal to that amount to the Security Agent for
application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; and (ii) promptly pay an amount equal
to the amount (if any) by which receipt or recovery exceeds the relevant liabilities owed to such creditor to the
Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; and

- in relation to receipts and recoveries received or recovered by way of set-off, promptly pay an amount equal to
that recovery to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

**Application of Proceeds/Waterfall**

All amounts received or recovered by the Security Agent in connection with the realization of all or any part of the
Transaction Security or on an Enforcement or otherwise paid to the Security Agent in accordance with the
Intercreditor Agreement for application in accordance with the Payments Waterfall (the “Enforcement Proceeds”)
will be paid to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the following payments waterfall (the
“Payments Waterfall”):

- _first, in payment of the following amounts (i) any sums owing to the Security Agent; and (ii) certain fees, costs_
and expenses owed to creditor representatives in respect of the Senior Secured Debt;

- _secondly, pro rata to (i) the relevant credit representative in respect of all amounts then due and payable in_
respect off the Revolving Credit Facility Liabilities; and (ii) to the Super Senior Hedging Banks in respect of
amounts then due and payable under any Super Senior Hedging Agreements;

- _thirdly, pro rata to (i) the Trustee on behalf of the holders of Notes for application towards the discharge of all_
amounts due and payable to the noteholders under the Notes; (ii) to the representative of the other Pari Passu
Creditors on behalf of those Pari Passu Creditors for application towards the discharge of all amounts then due
and payable to those Pari Passu Creditors at that time; and (iii) to the Pari Passu Hedging Banks in respect of
amounts then due and payable under any Pari Passu Hedging Agreements;

- _fourthly, in payment to any person to whom the Security Agent is obliged to pay or distribute in priority to any_
debtor a member of the Group; and

- _thereafter, to the relevant member of the Group._
For the avoidance of doubt (other than as provided above) payments of Enforcement Proceeds may only be
made to the Trustee for the holders of the Notes, if all payments then due and payable under the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement (or any Future Credit Facilities) and the Super Senior Hedging Liabilities have been paid in
full. Any Enforcement Proceeds will only be paid to the Shareholder Subordinated Lenders after repayment in full
of the Senior Secured Debt.

Payments made in breach of the above will be required to be held in trust by the relevant recipient and turned
over to the Security Agent for application in accordance with this paragraph above.

**Acceleration**

If an event of default occurs under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, a Future Credit Facility, the Notes or
Future Pari Passu Debt then any decision to accelerate the Revolving Credit Facility, such Future Credit Facility
or Notes or Future Pari Passu Debt and, subject as provided below, to take any other Enforcement Action will be
determined in accordance with the provisions of the Revolving Credit Facility or the Indenture or in accordance
with the terms of the Future Pari Passu Debt (as applicable). The Intercreditor Agreement will contain provisions
requiring each representative of any Pari Passu Creditors, the Senior Agent, agent in respect of any Future Credit
Liability and the Trustee to notify the other representatives of the Senior Secured Creditors of any instructions to
accelerate the Revolving Credit Facility, Future Credit Liabilities, Notes or Future Pari Passu Debt (as applicable).

respect of the liabilities secured by the Transaction Security over the assets of that Obligor and the shares in and

subsidiary of that Obligor from all or any part of its liabilities to the Senior Secured Creditors or others or otherwise
in connection with the Transactions (“Note Liabilities”) or other liabilities it may have to Shareholder Subordinated
Lenders, Intra-Group Lenders or Obligors (“Other Liabilities”); (b) any Transaction Security granted by that Obligor

Lender, Intra-Group Lender, or another Obligor over that Obligor’s assets or over the assets of any subsidiary of

The net proceeds of a Distressed Disposal (and the net proceeds of any disposal of liabilities) shall be paid to the
Security Agent (as the case may be) for application in accordance with the provisions set forth under “—
_Application of Proceeds/Waterfall” as if those proceeds were the proceeds of an enforcement of the Transaction_
Security and, to the extent that any disposal of liabilities has occurred, as if the disposal of liabilities had not

**Project Finance Facilities**

A number of our non-wholly owned subsidiaries and our wholly-owned subsidiary, Empark Aparcamientos
Andalucia, S.L.U., have entered into certain financing arrangements with banks in order to finance the
construction of parking infrastructure under our concession contracts. These financing arrangements are nonrecourse project financing arrangements, in which the lenders only have recourse against the subsidiary that is
the borrower under the arrangement (and its assets and, in some cases, its capital stock), and not to other
members of the Group. As of September 30, 2013, we had €92.9 million of indebtedness outstanding under our
Project Finance Facilities.

These Project Finance Facilities will not be refinanced as part of the Refinancing. Set forth below is a summary of
certain of our Project Finance Facilities.

shareholders. Distributions are permitted only in the form of dividends against the net
profit of the borrower for the prior fiscal year and the borrower may not make any distributions prior to making
24 amortization payments under the credit facility. As a result, no distributions are permitted to be paid prior to
January 2018. Other forms of remuneration, such as the payment of management fees, are also not permitted
under the terms of the facility.

concession, Plaza de Cataluña, in San Sebastian. As of September 30, 2013, the total outstanding amount
under the loan was €11.8 million and the interest rate was EURIBOR plus 2.75%.

The loan agreement imposes restrictions on the ability of the borrower to make distributions to its shareholders.
Distributions are permitted only in the form of dividends from the net profit of the borrower for the prior fiscal
year and the borrower may not make any distributions prior to making 12 amortization payments under the
credit facility. As a result, no distributions are permitted to be paid prior to October 2014. Before making a
distribution, the borrower must also meet certain other financial ratios. Other forms of capital remuneration,
such as the payment of management fees, are also not permitted under the terms of the facility.

facility agreement with Bilbao Bizkaia Kutxa. The original amount available under the second loan facility was
€3.1 million. The amortization payments under the loan facility commenced in October 2007, and the loan has

this loan facility was €9.0 million. The amortization payments under the loan facility commenced in June 15,
2012, and the loan has a final maturity in November 18, 2029. The loan facility is secured by a pledge over the
shares of the borrower, a pledge over the balances of the bank accounts of the company, a pledge over the
rights held by the borrower by virtue of specific agreements of the project and over the concession contract;
and a mortgage or pledge promise over assets of the project and over the concession. As of September 30,
2013, the total outstanding amount under the loan was €6.4 million and the interest rate was EURIBOR plus
3.50%.

This loan agreement imposes restrictions on the ability of the borrower to make distributions to its
shareholders. The borrower may not make any distributions prior to making compulsory amortization
payments, and before making a distribution the borrower must also meet certain financial ratios and other
requisites established in the facility.

with 403 parking spaces located at Praça D. João I (Oporto, Portugal). The amounts in debt shall be repaid in
20 half-yearly instalments and the first instalment was due after a period of 5 years and 7 months as of the

the Fixed Rate Notes Funding Loan Agreement, the “Funding Loan Agreements”), the principal amount of which
shall be equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Floating Rate Notes issued on the Issue Date. The
Funding Loan Agreements will provide that the borrower under each of the Funding Loans thereunder will pay to
the lender thereunder interest and principal as it becomes payable on the corresponding series of Notes
(including any additional amounts due thereunder). The Notes will be initially guaranteed by the Company and the
Subsidiary Guarantors as described under “—The Note Guarantees” and may, in the future, be guaranteed by
certain of the Company’s Restricted Subsidiaries (each such guarantee, a “Note Guarantee”). A Note Guarantee
given by a Subsidiary Guarantor may be released in certain circumstances, as described herein.


-----

**_The Notes and the Funding Loans_**

The Notes will be:

- general senior obligations of the Issuer;

- _pari passu in right of payment to any future Indebtedness of the Issuer that is not subordinated in right of_
payment to the Notes;

- senior in right of payment to any future Indebtedness of the Issuer that is subordinated in right of payment to
the Notes;

- guaranteed by the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors (and any future Guarantors) on a senior basis; and

- secured by the Collateral, which will be subject to the Revolving Credit Facility and certain Hedging Obligations
having a priority right to any recoveries received by the Security Agent in connection with a distressed sale or
realization or enforcement of the Collateral, as described under “—Security.”

The Issuer had no other Indebtedness on the date of the Indenture and will not be allowed to incur additional
Indebtedness under the Indenture except any Additional Notes, Hedging Obligations, intercompany Indebtedness
and any other Indebtedness, in each case, permitted to be incurred in compliance with the Indenture. Upon
completion of the Offering the Issuer’s only material asset is the right to receive payment from the Company on
the Funding Loans.

As of September 30, 2013, after giving pro forma effect to this Offering and borrowings under the Revolving Credit
Facility and the application of the proceeds thereof, we would have had consolidated debt, including the Notes, of
€515.5 million (excluding €7.5 million of additional borrowing capacity available under the Revolving Credit
Facility). See “Use of Proceeds” and “Capitalization.”

The Funding Loans will be:

- general unsecured senior obligations of the Company;

- effectively subordinated to all existing and future secured borrowings of the Company to the extent of the value
of the assets so secured; and

- effectively subordinated (in an insolvency proceeding) to any non-related third party borrowings of the
Company, except for those borrowings that have been set aside as fraudulent by a court.

The Floating Rate Notes Funding Loan will bear interest at a floating rate at least equal to the interest rate of the
Floating Rate Notes, and interest on the Floating Rate Notes Funding Loan will be payable quarterly in arrears on
or before the corresponding interest payment date under the Floating Rate Notes. The Fixed Rate Notes Funding
Loan will bear interest at a rate at least equal to the interest rate of the Fixed Rate Notes, and interest on the
Fixed Rate Notes Funding Loan will be payable semi-annually in arrears on or before the corresponding interest
payment date under the Fixed Rate Notes. The maturity date of the Funding Loans will be the same as the
maturity date of the Notes. Except as otherwise required by law, all payments under the Funding Loans will be
made without deductions or withholding for, or on account of, any applicable tax. In the event that the Company is
required to make any such deduction or withholding, such entity will gross-up each payment to the Issuer to
ensure that the Issuer receives and retains a net payment equal to the payment which it would have received had
no such deduction or withholding been made. Upon the issuance of any Additional Notes, the proceeds thereof
will be loaned to the Company pursuant to an additional loan or loans on substantially the same terms as the
Funding Loans.

**_The Note Guarantees_**

Each Note Guarantee (and the Note Guarantee by any future Guarantors) will be:

- a general senior obligation of the relevant Guarantor;

- _pari passu in right of payment to all existing and future Indebtedness of that Guarantor that is not subordinated_
in right of payment to the Note Guarantee of that Note Guarantor;

- senior in right of payment to any future Indebtedness of that Guarantor that is subordinated in right of payment
to the Note Guarantee of that Guarantor;

- secured by the Collateral, which will be subject to the Revolving Credit Facility and to certain Hedging
Obligations having a priority right to any recoveries received by the Security Agent in connection with a
distressed sale or realization or enforcement of the Collateral, as described under “—Security”; and


-----

- subject to limitations described herein and in “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes” and “Risk Factors—
_Risks Related to Our Structure.”_

As of the date of the Indenture, all the Company’s Subsidiaries will be “Restricted Subsidiaries.” However, under
the circumstances described below under the subheading “—Certain Covenants—Designation of Restricted and
_Unrestricted Subsidiaries,” the Company will be permitted to designate certain of its Subsidiaries as “Unrestricted_
_Subsidiaries.” Any Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to the restrictive covenants in the Indenture._

Not all our Subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization or
similar event in the applicable jurisdiction of any non-guarantor Subsidiaries, these Subsidiaries will pay the
holders of their debt and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to the
Company. The Company will depend, in part, upon the cash flow of its operating company subsidiaries in order to
satisfy its obligations under its Note Guarantee and the Funding Loans.

The initial Guarantors will consist of the Company, which directly or indirectly holds all our Restricted Subsidiaries
and also conducts some operations, and the Subsidiary Guarantors. The Subsidiary Guarantors initially will
consist of Dornier, S.A., Femet, S.A., Balsol 2001, S.A., ESLI—Parques de Estacionamento, S.A. and Empark
Portugal Empreendimentos e Exploração de Parqueamentos S.A. and Estacionamientos Guipuzcoanos, S.L.,
which will become a Subsidiary Guarantor following its conversion into a Spanish sociedad anónima. The
Company has agreed to implement this conversion as soon as practicable. The conversion is expected to take
place within approximately 60 to 90 days following the Issue Date. For the twelve months ended September 30,
2013, the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors (including Estacionamientos Guipuzcoanos, S.L.) generated
78.1% and 79.9% of the Group’s Adjusted Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA, respectively, and held 95.7% of the
Group’s total assets (and 63.4% of the Group’s tangible and intangible assets, excluding goodwill) as of
September 30, 2013, in each case as determined under IFRS. As of September 30, 2013, after giving pro forma
effect to the Refinancing, the Company’s Subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes would have had €102.2
million of Indebtedness outstanding.

In addition, pursuant to the covenant entitled “—Additional Note Guarantees,” subject to certain exceptions, any
Restricted Subsidiary (i) that after the date of the Indenture is or becomes a Material Subsidiary (except for
(a) Restricted Subsidiaries which are Material Subsidiaries at the date of the Indenture but not initial Subsidiary
Guarantors, (b) Restricted Subsidiaries that are already Subsidiary Guarantors, (c) Restricted Subsidiaries that
are not Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiaries of the Company and (d) Non-Recourse Restricted Subsidiaries) or
(ii) that guarantees certain Indebtedness of other entities, will also be required to become a Subsidiary Guarantor.
The Note Guarantees will be joint and several obligations of the Guarantors. The obligations of each Guarantor
under its Note Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent that Note Guarantee from constituting a
fraudulent conveyance under applicable law and as otherwise required under applicable law. See “Risk Factors—
_Risks Relating to the Notes—Certain of the Note Guarantees will be limited to a specified amount, and each Note_
_Guarantee will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to_
_certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability.”_

A Subsidiary Guarantor may not sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all its assets to, or consolidate
with or merge with or into (whether or not such Subsidiary Guarantor is the surviving Person) another Person,
other than the Company or another Subsidiary Guarantor, unless:

(1) immediately after giving effect to that transaction, no Default or Event of Default exists; and

(2)(a) the Person acquiring the property in any such sale or disposition or the Person formed by or surviving
any such consolidation or merger assumes all the obligations of that Subsidiary Guarantor under the
Indenture and its Note Guarantee pursuant to a supplemental indenture satisfactory to the Trustee;

(b) if the transaction constitutes a sale or disposition of all or substantially all its assets, the Net
Cash Proceeds of such sale or disposition are applied in accordance with the applicable
provisions of the Indenture; or

(c) in any transaction between (i) the Company or a Subsidiary Guarantor and (ii) a Restricted
Subsidiary that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor, the Company or such Subsidiary Guarantor is the
surviving Person or the Restricted Subsidiary is the surviving Person and assumes all the
obligations of the Company or such Subsidiary Guarantor under the Indenture and its Note
Guarantee pursuant to a supplemental indenture satisfactory to the Trustee.


-----

**Release of Note Guarantees**

The Note Guarantee of a Subsidiary Guarantor will be released:

(1) in connection with any sale or other disposition of all or substantially all the assets of that Subsidiary
Guarantor (including by way of merger or consolidation) to a Person that is not (either before or after
giving effect to such transaction) the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company, if the sale
or other disposition does not violate the “Asset Sale” provisions of the Indenture, and all obligations of
that Subsidiary Guarantor with respect to other Indebtedness of the Company and its Restricted
Subsidiaries are also released;

(2) in connection with any sale of all the Capital Stock of that Subsidiary Guarantor to a Person that is not
(either before or after giving effect to such transaction) the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary of the
Company, if the sale does not violate the “Asset Sale” provisions of the Indenture, and all obligations
of that Subsidiary Guarantor with respect to other Indebtedness of the Company and its Restricted
Subsidiaries are also released;

(3) if the Company designates any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Subsidiary Guarantor as an Unrestricted
Subsidiary in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture;

(4) upon legal defeasance or covenant defeasance or discharge of the Notes as described under the
captions “Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” and “Satisfaction and Discharge;”

(5) as described under the caption “Amendment, Supplement and Waiver;”

(6) in the case of Note Guarantees granted pursuant to the covenant entitled “—Additional Note
_Guarantees,” upon the discharge of the Indebtedness or the release and discharge of the guarantee_
that gave rise to the obligation to guarantee the Notes;
(7) upon the sale of all the Capital Stock of, or all or substantially all the assets of, such Subsidiary
Guarantor or its Parent Company pursuant to a security enforcement sale in compliance with the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, or as otherwise provided for under
the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(8) upon the full and final payment and performance of all obligations of the Company and the Issuer
under the Indenture and the Notes; or

(9) in accordance with an enforcement action pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement.

See “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales.”

No release and discharge of a Note Guarantee will be effective against the Trustee, the Security Agent or the
holders of Notes until the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee and the Security Agent an officer’s certificate and an
opinion of counsel stating that all conditions precedent provided for in the Indenture and the Security and
Guarantee Documents relating to such release and discharge have been satisfied and that such release and
discharge is authorized and permitted under the Indenture and the Security and Guarantee Documents and the
Trustee and Security Agent will be entitled to rely on such officer’s certificate and opinion absolutely and without
further inquiry. At the request and expense of the Issuer, the Trustee, or the Security Agent, as applicable, will
execute any documents reasonably required in order to evidence or effect such release, discharge and
termination in respect of such Note Guarantee. None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Security Agent or any
Guarantor will be required to make a notation on the Notes to reflect any such release, termination or discharge.

**_Intercreditor Agreement_**

To establish the relative rights of certain creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors under their financing
arrangements, including, the Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility and certain Hedging Obligations, the Issuer, the
Trustee, the agent under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Security Agent, among others, will enter into the
Intercreditor Agreement. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.”

Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, in the event of acceleration of the Revolving Credit Facility or the
Notes, amounts recovered in respect of the Notes, including from the enforcement of the Collateral, are required
to be turned over to the Security Agent and, subject to the payment of fees and expenses of the agent under the
Revolving Credit Facility, the Trustee and Security Agent, paid by the Security Agent to the lenders under the
Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties to certain Hedging Obligations in priority to the holders of the Notes.


-----

**Security**

**_General_**

Pursuant to the Indenture and various Security and Guarantee Documents, the Issuer and the Guarantors will
grant to the Security Agent first-priority liens, the benefit of which will be subject in an enforcement to the priority
liens securing the Revolving Credit Facility and certain Hedging Obligations and subject to the grant of further
Permitted Collateral Liens, over the following assets (the “Collateral”):

(1) all the issued and outstanding shares of the Issuer, 99.9% of the issued and outstanding shares of the
Company and all the issued and outstanding shares of Dornier, S.A., Femet, S.A., Estacionamientos
Guipuzcoanos, S.L., Balsol 2001, S.A. and Empark Portugal—Empreendimentos e Exploração de
Parqueamentos, S.A. (but only following the conversion of the shares thereof to bearer form as
described below);

(2) 24.5% of the issued and outstanding shares of Sociedad Municipal de Aparcamientos y Servicios,
S.A.;
(3) 43.0% of the issued and outstanding shares of Estacionamientos Urbanos de Leon, S.A.;

(4) a security assignment of the Issuer’s rights under the Funding Loan Agreements and the Issuer
Intercompany Loan Agreement;

(5) a first-ranking pledge over all the credit rights under certain of the Guarantors’ Spanish off-street
concessions (which include the rights to receive compensation, payments and owed amounts under
the concession agreements); and

(6) a first-priority account pledge covering certain bank accounts of the Issuer and the Guarantors
organized under the laws of Spain.

The Security and Guarantee Documents will be executed on the Issue Date. The Security and Guarantee
Documents will be valid and enforceable following the satisfaction of the conditions subsequent set forth therein,
including the release of the security pledged in connection with the Existing Credit Facilities and the conversion of
the issued and outstanding shares of Empark Portugal—Empreendimentos e Exploração de Parqueamentos,
S.A. to bearer form. See “Risk Factors—The Notes and the Note Guarantees will not be secured by the Collateral
_on the Issue Date.” In addition, the Company has agreed to take all necessary actions to perfect the security_
interests in the Collateral to the extent required under the relevant Security and Guarantee Documents executed
on the Issue Date, subject, in each case, to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (including the Agreed
Security Principles) and the requirements set forth in such Security and Guarantee Documents, as soon as
practicable and in any event substantially concurrently with any perfection of the security interest in the Collateral
granted to secure the obligations of the obligors under the Revolving Credit Facility.

Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—
_Impairment of Security Interest” and “—Certain Covenants—Liens,” the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries_
are permitted to pledge the Collateral in connection with future issuances of its Indebtedness, including any
Additional Notes, or Indebtedness of its Restricted Subsidiaries, in each case as permitted under the Indenture
and on terms consistent with the relative priority of such Indebtedness.

No appraisals of any Collateral have been prepared by or on behalf of the Issuer, the Security Agent or the
Trustee in connection with the issuance of the Notes and the Note Guarantees. By its nature, some or all the
Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, the Collateral may not
be able to be sold in a short period of time or at all.

Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent will not be required to accept or act with
respect to any Collateral if it is of a type or in a jurisdiction which the Security Agent determines does not meet or
comply with its internal regulations or policies or with any law or regulation, or which might impose liability on the
Security Agent.

The security interests of the Security Agent in the shares of Estacionamientos Urbanos de Leon, S.A. and any
future credit rights which are part of the Collateral may not be enforceable if certain actions are not taken in
respect of the registration, recordation or recognition of the security interests being granted. See “Risk Factors—
_The Security Agent may not be able to enforce a portion of the Collateral if certain actions are not taken to_
_register and perfect the security interests in the Collateral.”_

The Liens on the Collateral will be limited as necessary to recognize certain limitations arising under or imposed
by local law and defenses generally available to providers of Collateral (including those that relate to fraudulent


-----

conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, capital
maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other
considerations under applicable law. For a brief description of such limitations, please see “Risk Factors—Risks
_Relating to the Notes.”_
**_Security and Guarantee Documents_**

The Issuer, the Guarantors and the Security Agent will, as applicable, enter into the Security and Guarantee
Documents, which define the terms of the security interests that secure the Notes and the Note Guarantees. The
Security and Guarantee Documents will secure the payment and performance when due of all the obligations of
the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Notes, the Indenture, the Note Guarantees and other obligations.

Subject to the terms of the Indenture and the Security and Guarantee Documents, the Issuer and the Guarantors
will have the right to remain in possession and retain exclusive control of the Collateral securing the Notes and
the Note Guarantees, to freely operate the Collateral and to collect, invest and dispose of any income therefrom.

The Security and Guarantee Documents will, as described under the caption “Description of Other
_Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement,” permit the Trustee and the agent for the Revolving Credit Facility to_
instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action under the Security and Guarantee Documents following (i)
the occurrence of an event of default under such Indebtedness (ii) such Indebtedness being declared due and
payable and (iii) the requisite approval or consent of the holders of such Indebtedness.

**_Priority_**

The relative priority among (a) the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility, (b) the counterparties under certain
Hedging Obligations and (c) the Trustee and the holders of Notes under the Indenture with respect to the security
interests in the Collateral created by the Security and Guarantee Documents and that secure the obligations
under the Notes or the Note Guarantees and the Indenture will be established by the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement, the Indenture, the Security and Guarantee Documents, the Revolving Credit Facility and such
Hedging Obligations, which provide that all obligations under the Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility and certain
Hedging Obligations are secured equally and ratably by a first priority interest in the Collateral, but in the event of
acceleration of the Revolving Credit Facility, lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties to
certain Hedging Agreements will receive proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral in priority to holders of
the Notes. Amounts recovered in respect of the Notes, including from the enforcement of the Collateral, are
required to be turned over to the Security Agent and, subject to the payment of fees and expenses of the agent
under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Trustee and Security Agent, will be paid by the Security Agent to the
lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties to certain Hedging Obligations in priority to the
holders of the Notes.

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, any liabilities in respect of obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement and certain Hedging Obligations permitted to be incurred under the covenant “—Certain Covenants—
_Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock and Disqualified Stock” and permitted to be secured_
on the Collateral on a super priority basis under the covenant “—Certain Covenants—Liens” will receive priority
over the holders of the Notes with respect to any proceeds received upon any enforcement action over any
Collateral. The Company is permitted to grant security over the Collateral in connection with future incurrence of
Indebtedness or Indebtedness of its Restricted Subsidiaries, including any Additional Notes, in each case, as
permitted under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.
**_Release_**

The Issuer and the Guarantors will be entitled to the release of property and other assets constituting Collateral
from the Liens securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees under any one or more of the following
circumstances:

(1) in connection with any sale or other disposition of the assets to a Person that is not (either before or
after giving effect to such transaction) the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company, if the
sale or other disposition does not violate the “Asset Sale” provisions of the Indenture;

(2) if the Company designates any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary
in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture;

(3) upon legal defeasance or covenant defeasance or discharge of the Notes as described under the
caption “Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” and “Satisfaction and Discharge;”

(4) as described under the caption “Amendment, Supplement and Waiver;”


-----

(5) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Note Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the
Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Guarantor;

(6) as provided for under the Intercreditor Agreement, including in connection with an enforcement sale;

(7) upon the full and final payment and performance of all obligations of the Company and the Issuer
under the Indenture and the Notes; or

(8) as described in the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Liens.”

The Indenture will provide that any release of a Lien on Collateral will be evidenced by the delivery by the Issuer
to the Trustee and the Security Agent of an officer’s certificate of the Issuer and an opinion of counsel on which
officer’s certificate and opinion of counsel the Trustee and Security Agent will be entitled to rely absolutely and
without further inquiry, and that the Security Agent will acknowledge and confirm such release upon delivery of
such officer’s certificate and opinion.

The Security Agent may need to evaluate the impact of the potential liabilities before determining to foreclose on
certain Collateral. In this regard, the Security Agent may decline to foreclose on the Collateral or exercise
remedies available if it does not receive indemnification, security or pre-funding to its satisfaction from the holders
of the Notes. In addition, the Security Agent’s ability to foreclose on the Collateral on behalf of the holders of the
Notes may be subject to lack of perfection, the consent of third parties, prior Liens and practical problems
associated with the realization of the Security Agent’s Liens on the Collateral.

The Indenture will provide that the Security Agent will have no liability to any of the holders of the Notes as a
consequence of its performance or non-performance under the Security and Guarantee Documents, except for its
gross negligence or willful misconduct.

**Principal, Maturity and Interest and Payment of Notes**

The Issuer will issue €235,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of Fixed Rate Notes and €150,000,000 in
aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate Notes in this Offering. The Fixed Rate Notes and the Floating Rate
Notes are each separate series of Notes but will be treated as a single class of securities under the Indenture,
except as otherwise stated herein. As a result, holders of each series of Notes will not have separate rights to,
among other things, give notice of Defaults or to direct the Trustee to exercise remedies during an Event of
Default or otherwise.
Subject to compliance with the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Incurrence of Indebtedness and
_Issuance of Preferred Stock and Disqualified Stock,” the Issuer is permitted to issue more Floating Rate Notes_
from time to time under the Indenture in an unlimited aggregate principal amount (the “Additional Floating Rate
_Notes”) and issue more Fixed Rate Notes from time to time under the Indenture, in an unlimited aggregate_
principal amount (the “Additional Fixed Rate Notes”). Any Additional Floating Rate Notes or Additional Fixed Rate
Notes (together, the “Additional Notes”) that the Issuer issues in the future will be identical in all respects to the
Notes that the Issuer is issuing hereby (including with respect to the Note Guarantees), except that Notes issued
in the future will have different issuance prices and issuance dates. All Notes, including any Additional Notes, will
be treated as a single class under the Indenture with respect to certain waivers, certain amendments,
redemptions and offers to purchase; provided that Additional Notes will not be issued with the same ISIN or
Common Code, as applicable, as existing Notes unless such Additional Notes are fungible with the existing Notes
for U.S. Federal income tax purposes. Unless the context otherwise requires, for all purposes of the Indenture
and this “Description of the Notes,” references to the Fixed Rate Notes include the Fixed Rate Notes offered
hereby and any Additional Fixed Rate Notes actually issued, references to the Floating Rate Notes include the
Floating Rate Notes offered hereby and any Additional Floating Rate Notes actually issued, and references to the
Notes include the Notes offered hereby and any Additional Notes actually issued.

The Issuer will issue Notes in minimum denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess
thereof. For so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted
for trading on the Euro MTF market and the rules of such exchange so require, the Issuer will publish a notice of
any change in these denominations in a newspaper having a general circulation in Luxembourg (currently
expected to be the Luxemburger Wort) or the website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu).

**_Floating Rate Notes_**

The Floating Rate Notes will mature on December 15, 2019. Interest on the Floating Rate Notes will be payable
quarterly in arrears on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing on March
15, 2014. We will make each interest payment to the holders of record on the immediately preceding March 1,


-----

June 1, September 1 and December 1. The redemption price at maturity will be 100% of the par value of the
Floating Rate Notes.

Each Floating Rate Note will bear interest at a rate per annum (the “Applicable Rate”), reset quarterly, equal to
EURIBOR plus 5.5%, as determined by the calculation agent (the “Calculation Agent”), which will initially be
Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch.

Interest on the Floating Rate Notes will accrue from the date of original issuance or, if interest has already been
paid, from the date it was most recently paid. Interest will be computed on the basis of the actual number of days
in the interest period concerned divided by 360.

Set forth below is a summary of certain of the provisions from the Indenture relating to the calculation of interest
on the Floating Rate Notes.

“Determination Date” with respect to an Interest Period, means the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days
preceding the first day of such Interest Period, except that the initial Determination Date will be December 16,
2013.

“EURIBOR” with respect to an Interest Period, means the rate (expressed as a percentage per annum) for
deposits in euro for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the
Determination Date that appears on Reuters Page 248 as of 11:00 a.m. Brussels time, on the Determination
Date, provided, however, that EURIBOR shall never be less than 0%. If Reuters Page 248 does not include such
a rate or is unavailable on a Determination Date, the Calculation Agent will request the principal London office of
each of four major banks in the Euro-zone inter-bank market, as selected by the Calculation Agent, to provide
such bank’s offered quotation (expressed as a percentage per annum) as of approximately 11:00 a.m., Brussels
time, on such Determination Date, to prime banks in the Euro-zone inter-bank market for deposits in a
Representative Amount in euro for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement
Days after the Determination Date. If at least two such offered quotations are so provided, the rate for the Interest
Period will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations. If fewer than two such quotations are so provided, the
Calculation Agent will request each of three major banks in London, as selected by the Calculation Agent, to
provide such bank’s rate (expressed as a percentage per annum), as of approximately 11:00 a.m., London time,
on such Determination Date, for loans in a Representative Amount in euro to leading European banks for a threemonth period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date. If at least
two such rates are so provided, the rate for the Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such rates. If fewer
than two such rates are so provided then the rate for the Interest Period will be the rate in effect with respect to
the immediately preceding Interest Period.

“Euro-zone” means the region comprised of member states of the European Union that adopt the euro.

“Interest Period” means the period commencing on and including an interest payment date and ending on and
including the day immediately preceding the next succeeding interest payment date, with the exception that the
first Interest Period will commence on and include the Issue Date and end on and include March 14, 2014.

“Representative Amount” means the greater of (i) €1,000,000 and (ii) an amount that is representative for a single
transaction in the relevant market at the relevant time.

“Reuters Page 248” means the display page so designated by Reuters (or such other page as may replace that
page on that service, or such other service as may be nominated as the information vendor).

“TARGET Settlement Day” means any day on which the Trans-European Automated Real-Time Gross Settlement
Express Transfer (TARGET) System is open.

The Calculation Agent will, as soon as practicable after 11:00 a.m. (London time) on each Determination Date,
determine the Applicable Rate and calculate the aggregate amount of interest payable in respect of the following
Interest Period (the ‘‘Interest Amount’’). The Interest Amount will be calculated by applying the Applicable Rate to
the principal amount of each Floating Rate Note outstanding at the commencement of the Interest Period,
multiplying each such amount by the actual amounts of days in the Interest Period concerned divided by 360. All
percentages resulting from any of the above calculations will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one
hundred thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point being rounded upwards
(e.g., 4.876545% (or .04876545) being rounded to 4.87655% (or .0487655)). The determination of the Applicable
Rate and the Interest Amount by the Calculation Agent will, in the absence of willful default, bad faith or manifest
error, be final and binding on all parties. In no event will the rate of interest on the Floating Rate Notes be higher
than the maximum rate permitted by applicable law.


-----

**_Fixed Rate Notes_**

The Fixed Rate Notes will mature on December 15, 2019. Interest on the Fixed Rate Notes will accrue at the rate
of 6.75% per annum and will be payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year,
commencing on June 15, 2014. We will make each interest payment to the holders of record on the immediately
preceding June 1 and December 1. The redemption price at maturity will be 100% of the par value of the Fixed
Rate Notes.

Interest on the Fixed Rate Notes will accrue from the date of original issuance or, if interest has already been
paid, from the date it was most recently paid. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised
of twelve 30-day months.
**Methods of Receiving Payments on the Notes**

The Issuer will make payments on the Global Notes to the Principal Paying Agent for further credit to Euroclear or
Clearstream (as applicable), which will, in turn, distribute such payments in accordance with its procedures.

Payments of principal of, and premium, if any, on each Note in definitive registered form (“Definitive Registered
_Notes”) will be made by transfer on the due date to an account maintained by the payee pursuant to details_
provided by the holder or, if requested by the holder, by check, in each case against presentation and surrender
(or, in the case of partial payment only, endorsement) of the relevant Definitive Registered Note at the office of
any Paying Agent. Payments of interest in respect of each Definitive Registered Note will be made by transfer on
the due date to an account maintained by the payee (the holder and account details of which appear on the
register of holders at the close of business on the relevant record date) or, if requested by the holder, by check
mailed on the relevant due date (or, if that is not a business day, the immediately succeeding business day) to the
holder (or to the first named of joint holders) of the Definitive Registered Note appearing on the register of holders
at the close of business at the address shown on the register of holders on such record date. Payments in respect
of principal of, premium, if any, and interest on Definitive Registered Notes are subject in all cases to any tax or
other laws and regulations applicable in the place of payment but without prejudice to the provisions under the
headings “—Optional Tax Redemption” and “—Additional Amounts.” The Paying Agent may require payment of a
sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or similar governmental charge in connection with any payment transfer
instructions received by the Paying Agent. Definitive Registered Notes, if issued, will only be issued in registered
form.

**Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes**

The Issuer will maintain one or more Paying Agents for the Notes, including a Paying Agent in London, United
Kingdom (the “Principal Paying Agent”). The initial Principal Paying Agent will be Deutsche Bank AG, London
Branch. Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A. will act as Transfer Agent. The Transfer Agent will be responsible for,
among other things, facilitating any transfers or exchanges of beneficial interests in different global Notes
between holders.

In addition, the Issuer undertakes that it will ensure that it maintains a Paying Agent in a Member State of the
European Union that is not obliged to withhold or deduct tax pursuant to European Council Directive 2003/48/EC
or any other Directive implementing the conclusions of the European Council of Economics and Finance Ministers
(“ECOFIN”) meeting of November 26-27, 2000 or any law implementing or complying with, or introduced in order
to conform to, such Directive.

The Issuer also will maintain one or more registrars (each a “Registrar”). The initial Registrar will be Deutsche
Bank Luxembourg S.A. The Registrar will maintain a register reflecting ownership of Definitive Registered Notes
outstanding from time to time and will make payments on Definitive Registered Notes on behalf of the Issuer (the
“Register”). A duplicate register of the Notes will also be maintained and kept at all times at the registered office of
the Issuer in Luxembourg (the “Duplicate Register”) in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Luxembourg
law of 10 August 1915 on commercial companies (as amended) and will be regularly updated (as applicable).
Upon written request of the Issuer or each time the Register is amended, the Registrar will provide to the Issuer a
copy of the Register in order to enable the Issuer to maintain the Duplicate Register.

The Issuer may change the Paying Agents, the Transfer Agents or the Registrars without prior notice to the
holders. For so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted
for trading on the Euro MTF market and the rules of this exchange so require, the Issuer will publish a notice of
any change of Paying Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar in a newspaper having a general circulation in
Luxembourg (currently expected to be the Luxemburger Wort) or the website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange
(www.bourse.lu).


-----

**Form of Notes**

The Notes will be issued in the form of global Notes in registered form and will be issued in minimum
denominations of €100,000 principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. In no event will
Definitive Registered Notes in bearer form be issued. See “Book-Entry; Delivery and Form.”

**Additional Amounts**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer, any Guarantor or a successor of any of them (each a “Payor”)
on the Notes or on the Note Guarantee will be made without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any
present or future taxes, duties, levies, imposts, assessments or similar governmental charges of whatever nature
(including penalties, additions to tax, and interest related thereto) (“Taxes”) unless the withholding or deduction of
such Taxes is then required by law. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or
levied by or on behalf of:

(1) Luxembourg, Spain, Portugal or any political subdivision or governmental authority of any thereof or
therein having power to tax;

(2) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on the Notes or a Note Guarantee is made by or on
behalf of a Payor, or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the
power to tax; or

(3) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is incorporated or organized or otherwise considered to be a
resident or doing business for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or governmental authority
thereof or therein having the power to tax (each of clause (1), (2) and (3), a “Relevant Taxing
_Jurisdiction”),_

will at any time be required from any payments made with respect to the Notes or the Note Guarantees, including
payments of principal, redemption price, interest or premium, the Payor will pay (together with such payments)
such additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that the net amounts obtained
in respect of such payments by each holder or beneficial owner of the Notes or the Note Guarantees, as the case
may be, after such withholding or deduction (including any such deduction or withholding from such Additional
Amounts), equal the amounts which would have been obtained in respect of such payments in the absence of
such withholding or deduction; provided, however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable with respect
to:

(1) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or former
connection between the relevant holder or the beneficial owner of a Note (or between a fiduciary,
settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant holder or
beneficial owner, if the relevant holder or beneficial owner is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership,
limited liability company or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including any Tax
imposed as a result of a holder or beneficial owner being a citizen or resident or national or domiciliary
of, or carrying on a business or maintaining a permanent establishment in, the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction), other than a connection resulting from the mere ownership or holding of such Note or
enforcement of rights thereunder or under any Note Guarantee or the receipt of payments in respect
thereof;

(2) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed if the holder or the beneficial owner of a Note had
made a declaration of non-residence or any other claim or filing for exemption to which it is entitled
(provided that (x) such declaration of non-residence or other claim or filing for exemption is required by
the applicable law of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from the
requirement to deduct or withhold such Taxes and (y) at least 30 days prior to the first payment date
with respect to which such declaration of non-residence or other claim or filing for exemption is
required under the applicable law of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, the relevant holder at that time
has been notified (in accordance with the procedures set forth in “—Selection and Notice”) by the
Payor or any other Person through whom payment may be made that a declaration of non-residence
or other claim or filing for exemption is required to be made), but, in each case, only to the extent the
holder or beneficial owner is legally eligible to make such declaration or other claim or filing;

(3) any Note presented for payment (where presentation is required) more than 30 days after the relevant
payment is first made available for payment to the holder (except to the extent that the holder would
have been entitled to Additional Amounts had the Note been presented during such 30-day period);


-----

(4) any Taxes other than taxes (i) imposed on income, or (ii) payable by withholding or deduction from a
payment under or with respect to the Notes or any Note Guarantee;

(5) any estate, inheritance, gift, sale, transfer, personal property or similar tax, assessment or other
governmental charge;

(6) any withholding or deduction imposed on a payment to a holder or beneficial owner and required to be
made pursuant to the European Union Directive on the taxation of savings income (the “Directive”)
which was adopted by the ECOFIN Council of the European Union (the Council of EU finance and
economic ministers) on June 3, 2003 or any other directive implementing the conclusions of the
ECOFIN meeting of November 26 and 27, 2000, or any law implementing or complying with, or
introduced in order to conform to, the Directive;

(7) any Taxes which could have been avoided by the presentation (where presentation is required) of the
relevant Note to another Paying Agent in a member state of the European Union;

(8) any Taxes imposed on, or on a third party on behalf of, a Spanish-resident legal entity subject to
Spanish Corporate Income Tax if the taxing authorities of the Kingdom of Spain determine that the
Notes do not comply with exemption requirements specified in any applicable tax law, including the
ruling of the General Directorate of Taxation (Dirección General de Tributos) dated 27 July 2004, or
any legislation or regulation implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, such
applicable law or such ruling, which law, ruling, legislation or regulation requires a withholding to be
made; or

(9) any combination of (1) through (8) above.

Such Additional Amounts will also not be payable where, had the beneficial owner of the Note been the direct
holder of the Note, it would not have been entitled to payment of Additional Amounts by reason of any of clauses
(1) to (9) inclusive above.

The applicable withholding agent will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount
deducted, withheld or required to be paid to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law.
Upon request, the Payor will use all reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the
payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes and
will provide such certified copies to each beneficial owner. In its response to such request, the Payor will attach to
each certified copy a certificate stating (x) that the amount of Taxes evidenced by the certified copy was paid in
connection with payments in respect of the principal amount of Notes then outstanding and (y) the amount of such
Taxes paid per €1,000 principal amount of the Notes. Copies of such documentation will be available for
inspection during ordinary business hours at the office of the Trustee by the beneficial owners of the Notes upon
request and will be made available at the offices of the Registrar located in Luxembourg or the registered office of
the Issuer if the Notes are then listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted for
trading on the Euro MTF market.
At least 30 days prior to each date on which any payment under or with respect to the Notes or any Note
Guarantee is due and payable (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises shortly before or after the
30th day prior to such date, in which case it shall be promptly thereafter), if the Payor will be obligated to pay
Additional Amounts with respect to such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee and the Principal Paying
Agent an officer’s certificate stating the fact that such Additional Amounts will be payable, the amounts so payable
and will set forth such other information necessary to enable the Principal Paying Agent to pay such Additional
Amounts to holders on the payment date. Each such officer’s certificate shall be relied upon until receipt of a
further officer’s certificate addressing such matters.

Wherever in the Indenture, the Notes, any Note Guarantee or this description of the Notes there are mentioned, in
any context:

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) purchase prices in connection with a purchase of Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to the Notes or any Note Guarantee,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts as described under this heading to the
extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.


-----

The Payor will pay any present or future transfer, stamp, issue, registration, court or documentary Taxes, or any
other excise or property Taxes which arise in any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the execution, issuance,
delivery or registration of any Notes or any other document or instrument referred to therein (other than a transfer
of the Notes following their initial resale by the initial purchaser thereof), or the receipt of any payments with
respect to the Notes or any Note Guarantee, including Taxes resulting from, or required to be paid in connection
with, the enforcement of the Notes, a Note Guarantee or any other such document or instrument following the
occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the Notes but excluding any such taxes, charges or similar
levies imposed by any jurisdiction outside the jurisdiction of organization of any Payor or any jurisdiction in which
a Paying Agent is located. The Payor will indemnify the holders and the beneficial owners of the Notes for any
such Taxes paid by them.

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture and will apply
_mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor to a Payor is incorporated, organized, doing business_
or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency
thereof or therein.

Rate Notes) at a redemption price of 106.75% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if
any, to the redemption date, with the Net Cash Proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings; provided that:

(1) at least 65% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Fixed Rate Notes (including any
Additional Fixed Rate Notes) issued under the Indenture remain outstanding immediately after the
occurrence of such redemption (excluding Fixed Rate Notes held by the Issuer or the Company and its
Subsidiaries); and

(2) the redemption occurs within 90 days of the date of the closing of such Equity Offering.

At any time on and after December 15, 2016, at the option of the Issuer or the Company, the Issuer may redeem
all or a part of the Fixed Rate Notes upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ notice, at the redemption prices

beginning on December 15 of the years indicated below:


-----

**Year** **Percentage**

2016........................................................................................................................................ 103.375%
2017........................................................................................................................................ 101.688%
2018 and thereafter ................................................................................................................ 100.000%

(3) the Applicable Premium at the redemption date, subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant
record date to receive interest due on any interest payment date occurring on or prior to the
redemption date.

Any redemption and notice may, in the Issuer’s or the Company’s discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one
or more conditions precedent.

**Mandatory Redemption**

Neither the Issuer nor the Company is required to make mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with
respect to the Notes.
**Optional Tax Redemption**

The Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time upon giving not less than 30 nor more
than 60 days’ notice to the holders of the Notes (which notice will be irrevocable) at a redemption price equal to
100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed for
redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to
receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) and Additional Amounts, if any, then due and which
will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise, if the Issuer determines
that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations or rulings promulgated
thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined above) which change or amendment is
publicly announced and becomes effective after the Issue Date (or, if a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date, after such later date); or

(2) any change in position regarding the application, administration or interpretation of such laws, treaties,
regulations or rulings (including a holding, judgment or order by a court of competent jurisdiction) of a
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined above) which change or amendment is publicly announced
and becomes effective after the Issue Date (or, if a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant
Taxing Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date, after such later date); (each of the foregoing in
clauses (1) and (2), a “Change in Tax Law”),

the Issuer, with respect to the Notes or a Guarantor, with respect to a Note Guarantee, as the case may be, is, or
on the next interest payment date in respect of the Notes would be, required to pay more than de minimis
Additional Amounts, and such obligation cannot be avoided by taking reasonable measures available to it
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the appointment of a new Paying Agent in accordance with the second
paragraph under “Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes” or, where such payment method would be
reasonable under the circumstances, payment through another Guarantor or the Issuer). Notwithstanding the
foregoing sentence, the imposition of Spanish Non-Resident Income Tax on any payment with respect to the
Notes or the Note Guarantees made to a non-Spanish resident without a permanent establishment in Spain (see
“Tax Considerations—Spanish Tax Considerations—Beneficial owners not residents in Spain without a
_permanent establishment”) shall not be considered to arise as a result of a Change in Tax Law. Notice of_
redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described under “—Selection
_and Notice.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given (a) earlier than 90 days_
prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obliged to make such payment or withholding if a payment
in respect of the Notes or the relevant Note Guarantee were then due and (b) unless at the time such notice is
given, such obligation to pay such Additional Amounts remains in effect. Prior to the publication or mailing of any
notice of redemption of the Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee (a) an officer’s


-----

certificate stating that the Issuer is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts
showing that the conditions precedent to its right so to redeem have been satisfied and (b) an opinion of an
independent tax counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee to the effect that the circumstances referred to
above exist; the Trustee and Security Agent will be entitled to rely absolutely and without further inquiry on such
officer’s certificate and such opinion of counsel.

**Repurchase at the Option of Holders**

**_Change of Control_**

If a Change of Control occurs, each holder of Notes will have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase all or
any part (equal to €100,000 or integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof) of that holder’s Notes pursuant to a
Change of Control Offer on the terms set forth in the Indenture. In the Change of Control Offer, the Issuer will
offer a payment (the “Change of Control Payment”) in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of each Note
repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on such Note, to the date of purchase (the “Change of
_Control Payment Date”). Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Issuer will mail a notice to each_
holder describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control and offering to repurchase
Notes on the Change of Control Payment Date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days
and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed, pursuant to the procedures required by the
Indenture and described in such notice. The Issuer and the Company will comply with the requirements of Rule
14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws
and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes and the related Note Guarantees as
a result of a Change of Control. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with
the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer and the Company will comply with the applicable
securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of
Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

On or prior to the Change of Control Payment Date, the Company will prepay the Funding Loans to the extent
necessary to finance the repurchase by the Issuer of any Notes tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control
Offer;

(2) deposit with the Principal Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect
of all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered; and

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Notes properly accepted together with an officer’s
certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions of Notes being purchased by the
Issuer.

The Principal Paying Agent will promptly mail or otherwise transfer to each holder of Notes properly tendered the
Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be
transferred by book entry) to each holder a new Note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the
Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each new Note will be in a principal amount of €100,000 or, if greater, an
integral multiple of €1,000 in excess thereof.

The provisions described above that require the Issuer to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of
Control will be applicable whether or not any other provisions of the Indenture are applicable. Except as described
above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the holders of
the Notes to require the Issuer to repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or
similar transaction.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party makes
the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set
forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes
properly tendered and not withdrawn under the Change of Control Offer. The Issuer also will not be required to
make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if it has theretofore issued a redemption notice in
respect of all the Notes in the manner and in accordance with the provisions described under “—Optional
_Redemption” and thereafter purchases all the Notes pursuant to such notice._

The definition of Change of Control includes a phrase relating to the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer,
conveyance or other disposition of “all or substantially all” of the properties or assets of the Company and its


-----

Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase
“substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the
ability of a holder of Notes to require the Issuer to repurchase its Notes as a result of a sale, lease, transfer,
conveyance or other disposition of less than all the assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken
as a whole to another Person or group may be uncertain. In addition, it should be noted that recent case law
suggests that, in the event that incumbent directors are replaced as a result of a contested election, issuers may
nevertheless avoid triggering a change of control under a clause similar to clause (4) of the definition of “Change
of Control,” if the outgoing directors were to approve the new directors for the purpose of such change of control
clause. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a holder of
Notes may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above.

Subject to the covenants described below, the Company could enter into certain transactions, including
acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations which, though not constituting a Change of Control under the
Indenture, could increase the amount of outstanding debt or otherwise affect the Company’s capital structure or
credit ratings. In addition, we may not be able to finance the payments required for a Change of Control Offer.
See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes—We may not be able to obtain the funds required to repurchase
_Notes upon a change of control.”_

The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a
result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of holders of a majority in
outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Notes under the Indenture.

**_Asset Sales_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, consummate an Asset Sale unless:

(1) the Company (or the Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) receives consideration at the time of
the Asset Sale at least equal to the Fair Market Value of the assets or Capital Stock issued or sold,
leased, conveyed or otherwise disposed of; and

(2) at least 75% of the consideration received in the Asset Sale by the Company or such Restricted
Subsidiary is in the form of cash, other Cash Equivalents or Replacement Assets. For purposes of this
provision, each of the following will be deemed to be cash:

(a) any liabilities, as shown on the Company’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s most recent balance
sheet, of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than contingent liabilities) that are
assumed by the transferee of any such assets and as a result of which the Company and its
Restricted Subsidiaries are no longer obligated with respect to such liabilities or are indemnified
against further liabilities;

(b) any securities, notes or other obligations received by the Company or any such Restricted
Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted by the Company or such Restricted
Subsidiary into cash within 180 days of the receipt thereof, to the extent of the cash received in
that conversion;

(c) any Capital Stock or assets, in each case, of the kind referred to in clauses (2) or (4) of the next
paragraph of this covenant;

(d) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result
of such Asset Sale, to the extent that the Company and each other Restricted Subsidiary are
released from any guarantee of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Sale; and

(e) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Company, the Issuer or any Guarantor received
from Persons who are not the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary.
Within 360 days after the receipt of any Net Cash Proceeds from an Asset Sale, the Company may apply those
Net Cash Proceeds, if any, at its option:

(1) to repay secured Indebtedness, Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor or
Indebtedness incurred under Credit Facilities and, in each case, to correspondingly permanently
reduce commitments with respect thereto;

(2) to acquire all or substantially all the assets of, or a majority of the Voting Stock of, another Permitted
Business;

(3) to make a capital expenditure;


-----

(4) to acquire other long-term assets that are used or useful in a Permitted Business; or

(5) to enter into a binding commitment to apply the Net Cash Proceeds pursuant to clauses (2), (3) or
(4) of this paragraph; provided that such binding commitment shall be treated as a permitted
application of the Net Cash Proceeds from the date of such commitment until the earlier of (x) the date
on which such acquisition or expenditure is consummated and (y) the 180th day following the
expiration of the aforementioned 360-day period;

_provided, however, if the assets sold constitute Collateral or constitute all or substantially all the assets of a_
Restricted Subsidiary whose Capital Stock has been pledged as Collateral, subject to the Agreed Security
Principles, the Company will pledge or will cause the applicable Restricted Subsidiary to pledge any acquired
Capital Stock or assets (to the extent such assets were of a category of assets included in the Collateral as of the
Issue Date) referred to in this covenant in favor of the Notes on a first-ranking basis.

Pending the final application of any Net Cash Proceeds, the Company may temporarily reduce revolving credit
borrowings or otherwise invest the Net Cash Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited by the Indenture.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this covenant, the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries will not
be required to apply any Net Cash Proceeds in accordance with this covenant except to the extent that the
aggregate Net Cash Proceeds from all Asset Sales which are not applied in accordance with this covenant
exceed €15 million.

Any Net Cash Proceeds from Asset Sales that are not applied or invested as provided in the second paragraph of
this covenant will constitute “Excess Proceeds.” When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds
€15 million, the Issuer will make an offer (the “Asset Sale Offer”) to all holders of Notes, and the Company will
make any required offer to purchase pari passu Indebtedness containing similar asset sale provisions, to
purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount of Notes and such pari passu Indebtedness that may be
purchased out of the Excess Proceeds and the Company will prepay the Funding Loans to the extent necessary
to finance the repurchase of the Notes by the Issuer. The offer price in any Asset Sale Offer will be equal to 100%
of principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase, and will be payable in cash. If any
Excess Proceeds remain after consummation of an Asset Sale Offer, the Company may use those Excess
Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes
and other pari passu Indebtedness tendered into such Asset Sale Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds,
the Trustee will select the Notes to be purchased on a pro rata basis in accordance with the rules of Euroclear
and Clearstream, as applicable. Upon completion of each Asset Sale Offer and, if applicable, purchase, the
amount of Excess Proceeds will be reset at zero.

The Issuer and the Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any
other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in
connection with each repurchase of Notes and the related Note Guarantees pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. To
the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Asset Sale provisions of the
Indenture, the Issuer and the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not
be deemed to have breached their respective obligations under the Asset Sale provisions of the Indenture by
virtue of such compliance.
**Selection and Notice**

If less than all the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, subject to the requirements of Clearstream and
Euroclear, the Principal Paying Agent or the Registrar will select Notes for redemption as follows:

(1) if the Notes are listed on any securities exchange, in compliance with the requirements, if any, of the
securities exchange on which the Notes are listed as certified to the Trustee by the Issuer; or

(2) if the Notes are not listed on any securities exchange, on a pro rata basis by use of pool factor.

No Notes may be redeemed in part such that the remainder of the Note is less that €100,000 in aggregate
principal amount. Notices of redemption will be mailed (or otherwise transmitted) by first class mail at least 30 but
not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of Notes to be redeemed at its registered
address, except that redemption notices may be mailed (or otherwise transmitted) more than 60 days prior to a
redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and
discharge of the Indenture.

In addition, so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted
for trading on the Euro MTF market and its rules so require, the Issuer will publish notices (including with respect
to optional redemptions, repurchases at the option of the holders or the exchange offer) in a leading newspaper
having general circulation in Luxembourg (currently expected to be the Luxemburger Wort) or the website of the


-----

Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu) and will inform the Luxembourg Stock Exchange of the
outstanding aggregate principal amounts of each series of the Notes then in issue.

If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note will state the portion
of the principal amount of that Note that is to be redeemed. A new Note in principal amount equal to the
unredeemed portion of the original Note will be issued in the name of the holder of Notes upon cancellation of the
original Note and will be collectible at the office of the Principal Paying Agent. Notes called for redemption
become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on
Notes or portions of them called for redemption.

**Prescription**

Claims against the Issuer, the Company or any Guarantor for the payment of principal of, or interest, premium, or
Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes will become void unless presentation for payment is made as required in
the Indenture within a period of seven years, in the case of principal, or five years, in the case of interest,
premium or Additional Amounts, if any, from the applicable original payment date therefor.

**Certain Covenants**

connection with any merger or consolidation involving the Company or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries) or to the direct or indirect holders of the Company’s or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries’
Equity Interests in their capacity as such (other than (A) dividends or distributions payable in Equity
Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Company, (B) dividends or distributions to the Company
or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company and (C) pro rata dividends or distributions made by a

(2) purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or retire for value (including, without limitation, in connection
with any merger or consolidation involving the Company) any Equity Interests of the Company or any
Parent Company;

(3) make any payment on or with respect to, or purchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire

any of its Restricted Subsidiaries), except (i) a payment of interest or principal at the Stated Maturity
thereof or (ii) the purchase, repurchase or other acquisition of Indebtedness purchased in anticipation
of satisfying a scheduled sinking fund obligation, principal installment or scheduled maturity, in each
case due within one year of the date of such purchase, repurchase or other acquisition; or

(4) make any Restricted Investment (all such payments and other actions set forth in these clauses
(1) through (4) being collectively referred to as “Restricted Payments”),

unless, at the time of and after giving effect to such Restricted Payment:

(1) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or would occur as a consequence of
such Restricted Payment;

(2) the Company would, after giving pro forma effect to such Restricted Payment (including the application
thereof) as if such Restricted Payment had been made at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter
period, have been permitted to incur at least €1.00 of additional Indebtedness (other than Permitted
Debt) pursuant to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test set forth in the first paragraph of the covenant
described below under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance
_of Preferred Stock and Disqualified Stock;” and_


-----

(3) such Restricted Payment, together with the aggregate amount of all other Restricted Payments made
by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries after the date of the Indenture (excluding Restricted
Payments permitted by clauses (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (7), (10), (11), (12) and (13) of the next
succeeding paragraph), is less than the sum, without duplication, of:

Consolidated Net Income for such period is a deficit, less 100% of such deficit, plus

(b) 100% of the aggregate net cash proceeds and Fair Market Value of property, assets or
marketable securities received by the Company since the Issue Date as a contribution to its
common equity capital or from the issue or sale of Equity Interests of the Company (other than

or convertible or exchangeable debt securities of the Company that have been converted into or
exchanged for such Equity Interests (other than Equity Interests (or Disqualified Stock or debt
securities) sold to a Subsidiary of the Company), plus

(c) 100% of any dividends or distributions (including payments made in respect of loans or
advances) received by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company after the Issue
Date from an Unrestricted Subsidiary of the Company or a Permitted Joint Venture, to the
extent that such dividends or distributions were not otherwise included in Consolidated Net
Income of the Company for such period (and provided that such dividends or distributions are
not included in the calculation of that amount of Permitted Investments permitted under clause
(11) of the definition thereof), plus

(d) to the extent that any Unrestricted Subsidiary of the Company is redesignated as a Restricted
Subsidiary after the Issue Date, the lesser of (i) the Fair Market Value of the Company’s
Investment in such Subsidiary as of the date of such redesignation or (ii) the Fair Market Value
of such Subsidiary as of the date on which such Subsidiary was originally designated as an
Unrestricted Subsidiary, plus

(e) to the extent that any Restricted Investment that was made after the Issue Date is sold for cash
or otherwise liquidated or repaid for cash or other Cash Equivalents (including, without
limitation, any sale for cash or other Cash Equivalents of an Equity Interest in an Unrestricted
Subsidiary), the lesser of (i) the cash return of capital with respect to such Restricted
Investment (less the cost of disposition, if any) and (ii) the initial amount of such Restricted
Investment.

The preceding provisions will not prohibit:

(1) the payment of any dividend within 60 days after the date of declaration of the dividend, if at the date
of declaration the dividend payment would have complied with the provisions of the Indenture;

(2) the redemption, repurchase, retirement, defeasance or other acquisition of any subordinated
Indebtedness of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary or of any Equity Interests of the Company

Cash Proceeds of the substantially concurrent sale (other than to a Subsidiary of the Company) of,
Equity Interests of the Company (other than Disqualified Stock) or from the substantially concurrent
contribution of equity capital to the Company; provided that the amount of any such Net Cash
Proceeds that are utilized for any such redemption, repurchase, retirement, defeasance or other
acquisition will be excluded from clause (3)(b) of the preceding paragraph;

(3) the defeasance, redemption, repurchase or other acquisition of subordinated Indebtedness of the
Company or any Guarantor with the Net Cash Proceeds from an incurrence of Permitted Refinancing
Indebtedness;

(4) any Restricted Payment made by exchange for, or out of the proceeds of the substantially concurrent
sale of, Equity Interests of the Company (other than Disqualified Stock) or a substantially concurrent
cash capital contribution received by the Company from its shareholders; provided, however, that the
Net Cash Proceeds from such sale or cash capital contribution will be excluded from clause (3)(b) of
the preceding paragraph and will not constitute Excluded Contributions;


-----

(5) the repurchase, redemption or other acquisition for value of Equity Interests of the Company or its
Restricted Subsidiaries representing fractional shares of such Equity Interests in connection with a
merger, consolidation, amalgamation or other combination of the Company or any such Restricted

Parent Company, the payment by the Company of, or loans or advances, dividends or distributions to
any Parent Company to pay dividends on the ordinary shares of the Company or any Parent
Company, in an amount not to exceed in any fiscal year 6% per annum of the net cash proceeds
received by the Company in any Public Offering or contributed in cash to the Company’s common
equity capital with the net cash proceeds of any such Public Offerings by any Parent Company;

(7) loans or advances made to employees, officers or directors in amounts not exceeding €2 million at any
time outstanding;
(8) other Restricted Payments made after the Issue Date in an amount (measured on the date each such
Restricted Payment was made and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value) when taken
together with all other Restricted Payments made pursuant to this clause (8) not to exceed €20 million
(provided that if an Investment is made pursuant to this clause in a Person that is not a Restricted
Subsidiary and such Person is subsequently designated a Restricted Subsidiary, such Investment will
thereafter be deemed to have been made pursuant to clause (3) of the definition of “Permitted
Investments” and not this clause);

(9) the repurchase, redemption or other acquisition or retirement for value of any Equity Interests of the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary held by any current or former officer, director, employee or
consultant of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries pursuant to any equity subscription
agreement, stock option agreement, restricted stock grant, shareholders’ agreement or similar
agreement; provided that the aggregate price paid for all such repurchased, redeemed, acquired or
retired Equity Interests may not exceed €1.0 million in any calendar year;

(10) any purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement for value of
Indebtedness of the Company or any Guarantor that is subordinated in right of payment to the Notes
or to any Note Guarantee (other than any Indebtedness so subordinated and held by Affiliates of the
Company) upon a Change of Control to the extent required by the agreements governing such
Indebtedness at a purchase price not greater than 101% of the principal amount of such Indebtedness,
but only if the Issuer shall have complied with its obligations under the covenant described under
“Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change of Control” and the Issuer repurchased all Notes
tendered pursuant to the offer required by such covenants prior to offering to purchase, purchasing or
repaying such Indebtedness;

(11) the declaration and payment of regularly scheduled or accrued dividends to holders of any class or
series of Disqualified Stock of the Company or any preferred stock of any Restricted Subsidiary

(12) Restricted Payments pursuant to clause (g) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under
“—Certain Covenants—Transactions with Affiliates”;

(13) Restricted Payments that are made with Excluded Contributions; and

(14) any Restricted Payment; provided that the Consolidated Leverage Ratio of the Company on a pro
_forma basis after giving effect to any such Restricted Payment does not exceed 4.5 to 1.0._

_provided, however, that after giving effect to any Restricted Payment referred to in clauses (6), (7), (8) or (14) of_
this paragraph, no Default or Event of Default will have occurred and be continuing or would occur as a
consequence thereof.

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) will be the Fair Market Value on the date of the
Restricted Payment of the assets or securities proposed to be transferred or issued by the Company or such
Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to the Restricted Payment. The Fair Market Value of any
assets or securities that are required to be valued by this covenant will be determined by the Board of Directors of
the Company. In the event of any sale of Equity Interests in a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of which such
Restricted Subsidiary is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary, the Company will be deemed to have made a
Restricted Investment equal to the Fair Market Value of any remaining Investment in such Restricted Subsidiary,


-----

or will by such Fair Market Value reduce the amount available for future Investments under one or more clauses
of the definition of Permitted Investments, as the Company shall determine.
**_Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock and Disqualified Stock_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create, incur,
issue, assume, guarantee or otherwise become directly or indirectly liable, contingently or otherwise, with respect
to (collectively, “incur”) any Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt), and the Company will not issue any
Disqualified Stock and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to issue any shares of preferred stock;
_provided, however, that:_

(a) the Company, any Subsidiary Guarantor, the Issuer and any other Financing Subsidiary may incur
Indebtedness, the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor may incur Acquired Debt and the Company
or any Subsidiary Guarantor may issue Disqualified Stock and any Guarantor may issue shares of
preferred stock, if the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Company’s most recently ended four full
fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are available immediately preceding the date on
which such additional Indebtedness is to be incurred or such Disqualified Stock or preferred stock is to
be issued would have been at least 2.00 to 1.00, determined on a pro forma basis (including a pro
forma application of the net proceeds therefrom), as if the additional Indebtedness had been incurred
or the Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock had been issued, as the case may be, at the beginning of
such four-quarter period; and

(b) if such Indebtedness is Senior Secured Indebtedness, the Company, any Subsidiary Guarantor, the
Issuer and any other Financing Subsidiary may incur such Senior Secured Indebtedness, if the
Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio for the Company’s most recently ended four full fiscal
quarters for which internal financial statements are available immediately preceding the date on which
such additional Senior Secured Indebtedness is to be incurred would have been less than 6.00 to 1.00,
determined on a pro forma basis (including a pro forma application of the net proceeds therefrom), as
if the additional Senior Secured Indebtedness had been incurred at the beginning of such four-quarter
period.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the incurrence by the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries
of any of the following items of Indebtedness (collectively, “Permitted Debt”):

(1) the incurrence by the Company and any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness and letters of credit
under Credit Facilities in an aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding under this clause
(1) not to exceed €40 million less the aggregate amount of all permanent commitment reductions with
respect to any Credit Facility (other than Indebtedness under a revolving credit facility) that have been
made pursuant to clause (1) of the second paragraph of the covenant entitled “—Repurchase at the
_Option of Holders—Asset Sales” by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries since the date_
of the Indenture;

(2) the incurrence by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries of the Existing Indebtedness;

Guarantors of Indebtedness represented by a Note Guarantee (including a Note Guarantee of
Additional Notes incurred in compliance with the Indenture) and (c) by the Company of Indebtedness
represented by the Funding Loans;

(4) the incurrence by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness represented by
Capital Lease Obligations, mortgage financings, sale and leaseback transactions or purchase money
obligations, in each case, incurred for the purpose of financing all or any part of the purchase price or
cost of construction or improvement of property, plant or equipment or other assets (including Capital
Stock) used in the business of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, in an aggregate principal
amount, including all Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness incurred under clause (5) hereof to refund,
refinance or replace any Indebtedness incurred pursuant to this clause (4), not to exceed €10 million at
any time outstanding;

(5) the incurrence by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Permitted Refinancing
Indebtedness in exchange for, or the net proceeds of which are used to refund, refinance or replace
Indebtedness (other than intercompany Indebtedness) that was permitted by the Indenture to be
incurred under the first paragraph of this covenant or clause (2), (3), (4), (5) or (13) of this paragraph;


-----

(6) the incurrence by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of intercompany Indebtedness
between or among the Company and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (including any Funding Loan or
other proceeds loan made by the Issuer or any other Financing Subsidiary in respect of Indebtedness
incurred by such Person); provided, however, that:

(a) if the Company or any other Guarantor is the obligor on such Indebtedness (other than
Indebtedness owed to any Financing Subsidiary in respect of Indebtedness issued by such
Financing Subsidiary and borrowed by the Company or another Guarantor) and the creditor is
not a Guarantor, such Indebtedness must be unsecured and ((i) except in respect of the
intercompany current liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business in connection with
the cash management operations of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries and (ii) only
to the extent legally permitted (the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries having completed
all procedures required in the reasonable judgment of directors of officers of the obligee or
obligor to protect such Persons from any penalty or civil or criminal liability in connection with
the subordination of such indebtedness)) expressly subordinated to the prior payment in full in
cash of all Obligations with respect, in any bankruptcy, insolvency or winding up of such obligor,
to its Note Guarantee;

(b) if the creditor is the Issuer or any other Finance Subsidiary, such Indebtedness may only be
incurred by the Company or another Guarantor; and

(c) (i) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Equity Interests that results in any such Indebtedness
being held by a Person other than the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company and
(ii) any sale or other transfer of any such Indebtedness to a Person that is not either the
Company or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company will be deemed, in each case, to constitute
an incurrence of such Indebtedness by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case
may be, that was not permitted by this clause (6);

(7) the incurrence by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Hedging Obligations that are
incurred for the purpose of fixing or hedging interest rate risk or currency risk (i) with respect to any
floating rate or non-euro denominated Indebtedness that is permitted by the terms of the Indenture to
be outstanding or (ii) for non-speculative purposes in the ordinary course of business;

(8) the guarantee by the Company or any of the other Guarantors (subject to compliance with the
covenant “—Certain Covenants—Additional Note Guarantees”) of Indebtedness of the Company or a
Restricted Subsidiary of the Company (including the Issuer and any other Financing Subsidiary but
excluding any Non-Recourse Restricted Subsidiary) that was permitted to be incurred by another
provision of this covenant and the guarantee by the Issuer or any other Financing Subsidiary of
Indebtedness and letters of credit under Credit Facilities of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary of
the Company (including the Issuer and any other Financing Subsidiary but excluding any NonRecourse Restricted Subsidiary) that was permitted to be incurred by another provision of this
covenant;
(9) the incurrence by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than the Issuer or any other
Financing Subsidiary) of Indebtedness in connection with one or more standby letters of credit or
performance bonds issued by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary (other than the Issuer or any
other Financing Subsidiary) in the ordinary course of business or pursuant to self-insurance obligations
and, in each case, not in connection with the borrowing of money or the obtaining of advances or
credit;

(10) the incurrence by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than the Issuer or any other
Financing Subsidiary) of Indebtedness arising from agreements providing for indemnification or
adjustment of purchase price or from guarantees or letters of credit securing any Obligations of the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than the Issuer or any other Financing Subsidiary)
pursuant to such agreements, incurred in connection with the sale or other disposition of any business,
assets or subsidiary of the Company, other than guarantees or similar credit support by the Company
or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness incurred by any Person acquiring such business, assets
or subsidiary; provided that the maximum Indebtedness permitted by this clause (10) in respect of any
such sale or other disposition of any business, assets or subsidiary shall not exceed the Net Cash
Proceeds from such sale or other disposition;

(11) the incurrence by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than the Issuer or any other
Financing Subsidiary) of Indebtedness arising from guarantees to suppliers, lessors, licensees,


-----

contractors, franchisees, governmental entities or customers who are not, in each case, Affiliates, and
incurred in the ordinary course of business;

(12) the incurrence by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than the Issuer or any other
Financing Subsidiary) of Indebtedness in respect of any obligations under workers’ compensation laws
and similar legislation;

(13) Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock of Persons that are acquired by the Company or
any Restricted Subsidiary of the Company or merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with
(including pursuant to any acquisition of assets and assumption of related liabilities) the Company or a
Restricted Subsidiary of the Company in accordance with the terms of the Indenture; provided that
such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock are not incurred or issued in connection with
such acquisition, merger, consolidation or other combination, and, after giving pro forma effect to such
acquisition, merger, consolidation or other combination, either:

(a) the Company would be permitted to incur at least €1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to
the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test set forth in the first sentence, of this covenant; or

(b) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Company is no less than immediately prior to such
acquisition, merger, consolidation or other combination;

(14) Indebtedness incurred pursuant to the factoring of receivables arising in the ordinary course of
business pursuant to customary arrangements; provided that either (a) no portion of such
Indebtedness has, directly or indirectly, contingent or otherwise, recourse to any property or assets of
the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (other than the receivables that are the subject of
the factoring), or (b) if such Indebtedness has recourse to any property or assets of the Company or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, only the portion of such Indebtedness that is not recourse to any
property or assets of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (other than receivables that are
the subject of the factoring) may be considered as “Permitted Debt” under this clause (14); and

(15) the incurrence by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of additional Indebtedness (including
Acquired Debt) in an aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) at any time
outstanding, including all Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness incurred to refund, refinance or replace
any Indebtedness incurred pursuant to this clause (15), not to exceed €30 million.

The accrual of interest or preferred stock dividends, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the
payment of interest on any Indebtedness in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms, the payment
of dividends on Disqualified Stock in the form of additional shares of the same class of Disqualified Stock and the
reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness as of the Issue Date (including, without
limitation operating leases) due to a change in GAAP will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness or
an issuance of Disqualified Stock for purposes of this covenant.

The incurrence by an Unrestricted Subsidiary of the Company of Non-Recourse Debt will not be deemed to be an
incurrence of Indebtedness or an issuance of Disqualified Stock for purposes of this covenant; provided, however,
that if any such Indebtedness ceases to be Non-Recourse Debt of such Unrestricted Subsidiary, such
Indebtedness will be deemed to constitute an incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary of the
Company.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that an item of proposed Indebtedness
meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Debt described in clauses (1) through
(15) above, or is entitled to be incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, the Company will be
permitted to classify such item of Indebtedness on the date of its incurrence, or later reclassify all or a portion of
such item of Indebtedness, in any manner that complies with this covenant. Indebtedness under the Revolving
Credit Facility outstanding on the date on which Notes are first issued and authenticated under the Indenture
(other than debt refinanced thereby) will be deemed to have been incurred on such date in reliance on the
exception provided by clause (1) of the second paragraph of the covenant entitled “—Certain Covenants—
_Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock and Disqualified Stock” and may not be reclassified._

**_Liens_**

The Company will not and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly,
create, incur, assume or otherwise cause or suffer to exist or become effective any Lien (the “Initial Lien”) of any
kind securing Indebtedness upon any of its or their property (including Capital Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries) or
assets, now owned or hereafter acquired, except (a) in the case of any property or asset that does not constitute


-----

Collateral, (i) Permitted Liens or (ii) unless all payments due under the Indenture and the Notes (including a Note
Guarantee in the case of Liens of a Guarantor) are secured on an equal and ratable basis with the Indebtedness
so secured until such time as such Indebtedness is no longer secured by a Lien (and if such Indebtedness so
secured is subordinated in right of payment to either the Notes or a Note Guarantee, on a senior priority basis);
and (b) in the case of any property or asset that constitutes Collateral, Permitted Collateral Liens.

Any Lien created for the benefit of the holders pursuant to this covenant will provide by its terms that such Lien
will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged (a) upon the release and discharge of the Initial
Lien with respect to clause (a) of the preceding paragraph other than as a consequence of an enforcement action
with respect to the assets subject to such Lien or (b) as set forth under the heading “—Security”.
**_Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Subsidiaries_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create or
permit to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted
Subsidiary to:

(1) pay dividends or make any other distributions on its Capital Stock to the Company or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries, or with respect to any other interest or participation in, or measured by, its
profits, or pay any indebtedness owed to the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries;

(2) make loans or advances to the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries; or

(3) transfer any of its properties or assets to the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries.

However, the preceding restrictions will not apply to encumbrances or restrictions existing under or by reason of:

(1) agreements governing Existing Indebtedness and Credit Facilities as in effect on the date of the
Indenture and any amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements,
refundings, replacements or refinancings of those agreements; provided that the amendments,
modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings, replacement or
refinancings are no more restrictive, taken as a whole, with respect to such dividend and other
payment restrictions than those contained in those agreements on the date of the Indenture (as
determined in good faith by the Company);

(2) (i) the Indenture, the Notes and the Note Guarantees, (ii) any Notes and guarantees in connection with
the subsequent issuance of debt securities by the Issuer or any other Financing Subsidiary in
accordance with and on terms no less onerous than the Indenture and (iii) the Intercreditor Agreement,
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security and Guarantee Documents;

(3) any encumbrance or restriction arising pursuant to an agreement or instrument relating to any
Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the provisions of the
covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of
_Preferred Stock” if the encumbrances and restrictions contained in any such agreement or instrument_
taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the holders of the Notes (i) than the
encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Revolving Credit Facility and the Intercreditor
Agreement, in each case, as in effect on the Issue Date or (ii) than is customary in comparable
financings (in each case, as determined in good faith by the Company);

(4) applicable law or regulation or the terms of any license, authorization, concession or permit granted to
or held by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary in connection with its engagement in any business
permitted by the covenant entitled “—Business Activities”;

(5) any instrument governing Indebtedness or Capital Stock of a Person acquired by the Company or any
of its Restricted Subsidiaries as in effect at the time of such acquisition (except to the extent such
Indebtedness was incurred in connection with or in contemplation of such acquisition), which
encumbrance or restriction is not applicable to any Person, or the properties or assets of any Person,
other than the Person, or the property or assets of the Person, so acquired; provided that, in the case
of Indebtedness, such Indebtedness was permitted by the terms of the Indenture to be incurred;

(6) customary non-assignment provisions in leases entered into in the ordinary course of business and
consistent with past practices;
(7) purchase money obligations for property acquired in the ordinary course of business that impose
restrictions on that property of the nature described in clause (4) of the second paragraph of the
covenant entitled “—Certain Covenants—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock
_and Disqualified Stock;”_


-----

(8) any agreement for the sale or other disposition of a Restricted Subsidiary that restricts distributions by
that Restricted Subsidiary pending its sale or other disposition;

(9) Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness; provided that the restrictions contained in the agreements
governing such Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness are no more restrictive, taken as a whole, than
those contained in the agreements governing the Indebtedness being refinanced (as determined in
good faith by the Company);

(10) Liens securing Indebtedness otherwise permitted to be incurred under the provisions of the covenant
entitled “—Certain Covenants—Liens” that limit the right of the debtor to dispose of the assets subject
to such Liens;

(11) customary provisions in joint venture agreements, asset sale agreements, stock sale agreements and
other similar agreements;

(12) provisions that restrict in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any property or
asset that is subject to a lease, license or other contract entered into in the ordinary course of
business;

(13) restrictions on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers under contracts entered into
in the ordinary course of business; and

(14) any encumbrance or restriction existing under any agreement that extends, renews, refinances or
replaces the agreements or instruments containing the encumbrances or restrictions in the foregoing
clauses (1) through (13), or in this clause (14); provided that the terms and conditions of any such
encumbrances or restrictions are no more restrictive in any material respect either than those under or
pursuant to the agreement or instrument so extended, renewed, refinanced or replaced (as determined
by the Company in good faith).

**_Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets_**

The Company may not, directly or indirectly: (1) consolidate or merge with or into another Person (whether or not
the Company is the surviving corporation); or (2) sell, lease, transfer, convey or otherwise dispose of all or
substantially all the properties or assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole, in one
or more related transactions, to another Person; unless:

(1) either: (a) the Company is the surviving corporation; or (b) the Person formed by or surviving any such
consolidation or merger (if other than the Company) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer,
conveyance or other disposition has been made (the “Surviving Entity”) is a Person organized or
existing under the laws of (i) Spain, (ii) any other member of the European Union that has adopted the
euro as its national currency, (iii) the United Kingdom or (iv) the United States, any state of the United
States or the District of Columbia;

(2) the Surviving Entity (if other than the Company) assumes all the obligations of the Company under its
Note Guarantee, the Funding Loans, the Indenture, the Security and Guarantee Documents, the
Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction no Default or Event of Default exists or would exist;
and
(4) the Company or the Surviving Entity, as the case may be, will:

(a) on the date of such transaction after giving pro forma effect thereto and any related financing
transactions as if the same had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period,
either (i) be permitted to incur at least €1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio test set forth in the first paragraph of the covenant entitled “—Certain
_Covenants—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock and Disqualified_
_Stock” or (ii) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Company (or, if applicable, the Surviving_
Entity) would equal or exceed the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Company immediately
prior to giving effect to such transaction; and

(b) the Company delivers to the Trustee an officer’s certificate and opinion of counsel, in each
case, stating that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture
comply with this covenant and that all conditions precedent in the Indenture relating to such
transaction have been satisfied and that the Indenture and the Notes constitute legal, valid and
binding obligations of the Company or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation


-----

and merger (as applicable) enforceable in accordance with their terms (provided that any such
opinion of counsel may assume matters of fact, including as a factual matter that one or more
conditions precedent have occurred), on which officer’s certificate and opinion of counsel the
Trustee and Security Agent will be entitled to rely absolutely and without further inquiry.

This “—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets” covenant will not apply to a consolidation, merger, sale, lease,
transfer, conveyance or other disposition of assets between or among the Company and any of the Guarantors.
Notwithstanding clause (4)(a) of the foregoing, the Company or any Guarantor may merge or consolidate with or
into, or transfer all or substantially all of its properties or assets to, an Affiliate solely for the purpose of
reincorporating or reorganizing the Company or such Guarantor in another jurisdiction to change its domicile or to
change its legal form.

In the event of any transaction described in and complying with the conditions listed in this covenant in which the
Company is not the continuing corporation, the successor Person formed or remaining or to which such transfer is
made will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of the Company, and the
Company will be discharged from all obligations and covenants under the Indenture, the Notes, the Note
Guarantee, the Funding Loans, the Intercreditor Deed and the Security and Guarantee Documents.

**_Transactions with Affiliates_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any payment to, or sell,
lease, transfer, convey or otherwise dispose of any of its properties or assets to, or purchase any property or
assets from, or enter into or make or amend any transaction, contract, agreement, understanding, loan, advance
or guarantee with, or for the benefit of, any Affiliate (each, an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate
payments or consideration in excess of €500,000, unless:

(1) the Affiliate Transaction is on terms no less favorable to the Company or the relevant Restricted
Subsidiary than those that would have been obtained in a comparable transaction by the Company or
such Restricted Subsidiary with an unrelated Person; and

(2) the Company delivers to the Trustee:

(a) with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions involving
aggregate consideration in excess of €5 million, a resolution of the Board of Directors of the
Company set forth in an officer’s certificate certifying that such Affiliate Transaction complies
with this covenant and that such Affiliate Transaction has been approved by a majority of the
Qualified Directors or the sole Qualified Director; and

(b) with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions involving
aggregate consideration in excess of €15 million, or, if there is no Qualified Director, in excess
of €5 million, an opinion that such transaction or series of transactions is fair to the holders from
a financial point of view, or is not less favorable than could reasonably be expected to be
obtained at the time in an arm’s length transaction with a Person who was not an Affiliate of the
Company, which opinion shall be issued by an independent accounting, appraisal or investment
banking firm of international or national standing.

The following items will not be deemed to be Affiliate Transactions and, therefore, will not be subject to the
provisions of the prior paragraph:

(a) transactions between or among (i) the Company or (ii) its Restricted Subsidiaries (or any entity
that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transactions);

(b) transactions with a Person (including any joint venture or equity investee) that is an Affiliate of
the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary solely because the Company or a Restricted
Subsidiary owns an Equity Interest in such Person;

(c) any employment agreement, collective bargaining agreement, consultant, employee benefit
arrangements with any employee, consultant, officer or director of the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary, including under any stock option, stock appreciation rights, stock
incentive or similar plans, entered into in the ordinary course of business;

(d) payment of reasonable and customary fees and reimbursements of expenses (pursuant to
indemnity arrangements or otherwise) of officers, directors, employees or consultants of the
Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries and payments of benefits and salaries to
employees of the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business;


-----

(e) issuances or sales of Equity Interests of the Company (other than Disqualified Stock) to
Affiliates of the Company;

(f) the incurrence of any Subordinated Shareholder Debt and any amendment, waiver or other
transaction with respect to any Subordinated Shareholder Debt in compliance with the other
provisions of the Indenture;

(g) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers, or purchasers or sellers of goods or services or
providers of employees or other labor, in each case in the ordinary course of business and
otherwise in compliance with the terms of the Indenture that are fair to the Company or the
Restricted Subsidiaries, in the reasonable determination of the members of the Board of
Directors of the Company or the senior management thereof, or are on terms at least as
favorable as might reasonably have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated Person;

(h) Restricted Payments that are permitted by the provisions of the Indenture described above
under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Restricted Payments” (other than Permitted
Investments described in clause (11) of the definition of “Permitted Investments”); and

(i) performance of any agreement or arrangement of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary as in
effect on the Issue Date and disclosed in this Final Offering Memorandum under “Related Party
_Transactions” or “Major Shareholders” and any amendment after the Issue Date (so long as_
such amendment is not disadvantageous to the holders of the Notes in any material respect) to
any such agreement or arrangement.

**_Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries_**

The Board of Directors of the Company or, if required by applicable law, the shareholders of the Company may
designate any Restricted Subsidiary of the Company (except the Issuer) to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary if that
designation would not cause a Default. If a Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the
aggregate Fair Market Value of all outstanding Investments owned by the Company and its Restricted
Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary so designated will be deemed to be an Investment made as of the time of such
designation and will either reduce the amount available for Restricted Payments under the first paragraph of the
covenant entitled “—Certain Covenants—Restricted Payments” or reduce the amount available for future
Investments under one or more clauses of the definition of Permitted Investments, as the Company shall
determine. That designation will only be permitted if such Investment would be permitted at that time and if such
Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary. The Board of Directors of the
Company or, if required by applicable law, the shareholders of the Company may redesignate any Unrestricted
Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary if the redesignation would not cause a Default.

**_Additional Note Guarantees_**

The Company will cause any Restricted Subsidiary that after the date of the Indenture is or becomes a Material
Subsidiary (except for (i) any Restricted Subsidiary which was a Material Subsidiary at the date of the Indenture
but was not an initial Subsidiary Guarantor, (ii) any Restricted Subsidiary that is already a Guarantor, (iii) any
Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary and (iv) any Non-Recourse Restricted
Subsidiary) to execute and deliver a supplemental indenture providing for the Note Guarantee by such Restricted
Subsidiary on the same terms as the Note Guarantees granted by the other Subsidiary Guarantors hereunder.
Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Company will also cause all the Capital Stock in such Restricted
Subsidiary to be pledged to secure the Notes and the Note Guarantees.

For so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted for
trading on the Euro MTF market and the rules of this exchange so require, the Issuer will publish a notice of such
additional guarantees in a newspaper having a general circulation in Luxembourg (currently expected to be the
_Luxemburger Wort) or the website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu)._

The Company will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, to guarantee the payment of
any other Credit Facilities of the Issuer or any Guarantor unless such incurrence is permitted by the covenant
entitled “—Certain Covenants—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock and Disqualified
_Stock,” and such Restricted Subsidiary (if not already a Guarantor) simultaneously executes and delivers a_
supplemental indenture or Security and Guarantee Document and delivers a supplemental intercreditor
agreement or accedes to the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement pursuant to
which such Restricted Subsidiary will guarantee payment of the Notes on the same terms and conditions as those
set forth in the Indenture or applicable Security and Guarantee Document, the Intercreditor Agreement and any


-----

Additional Intercreditor Agreement and which Note Guarantee will be senior to or pari passu with such Restricted
Subsidiary’s guarantee of such other Credit Facilities; provided that no such additional Note Guarantee need be
provided in respect of Credit Facilities of the Issuer or any Guarantor (i) that does not exceed €5 million, in the
aggregate with all other Credit Facilities described under this clause (i), (ii) if the guarantee of such Indebtedness
is pursuant to a regulatory requirement and such Credit Facilities is owed to a regulatory body or (iii) if such Credit
Facilities is guaranteed by such Restricted Subsidiary on the Issue Date and such Restricted Subsidiary is not a
Guarantor.
The Company will not be obligated to cause such Restricted Subsidiary to guarantee the Notes pursuant to either
the first or third paragraph of this caption “—Additional Note Guarantees” to the extent that such Note Guarantee
could reasonably be expected to give rise to or result in: (1) any violation of applicable law that cannot be avoided
or otherwise prevented through measures reasonably available to the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary; or
(2) any liability for the officers, directors or shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary.

The Company will not be obligated to cause such Restricted Subsidiary to guarantee the Notes pursuant to either
the first or the third paragraph of this caption “—Additional Note Guarantees” to the extent that such Note
Guarantee could reasonably be expected to give rise to or result in: (1) any cost, expense, liability or obligation
(including any Tax) other than reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and other than reasonable governmental or
regulatory filing fees; or (2) a requirement under applicable law, rule or regulation to obtain or prepare financial
statements or financial information of such Person to be included in any required filing with a legal or regulatory
authority that the Company is not able to obtain or prepare without unreasonable expense. Each such Note
Guarantee will be limited as necessary to recognize certain defenses generally available to guarantors (including
those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate
purpose, thin capitalization, distributable reserves, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses
affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law.

Notwithstanding the preceding paragraphs of this covenant, any Note Guarantee by a Restricted Subsidiary will
provide by its terms that it will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged when (i) the
Indebtedness that gave rise to the obligation to guarantee the Notes is discharged, (ii) in the case of any Note
Guarantee granted as contemplated under the third paragraph of this caption “—Additional Note Guarantees” as
a result of a Restricted Subsidiary guaranteeing other Credit Facilities, when such other Indebtedness is released
and discharged or (iii) otherwise under the circumstances described above under the caption “—Brief Description
_of the Notes, the Funding Loans, the Note Guarantees and the Intercreditor Agreement—The Note Guarantees.”_

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

The Company will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, take or knowingly or
negligently omit to take, any action which action or omission would or could reasonably be expected to have the
result of materially impairing the security interests with respect to the Collateral (it being understood that the
incurrence of Liens on the Collateral permitted by the definition of Permitted Collateral Liens will under no
circumstances be deemed to materially impair the security interests with respect to the Collateral) for the benefit
of the Trustee and the holders of the Notes, and the Company will not, and will not cause or permit any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries to, grant to any Person other than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and
the holders of the Notes and the other beneficiaries described in the Security and Guarantee Documents, the
Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, any interest whatsoever in any of the
Collateral; provided that (a) nothing in this provision will restrict the discharge or release of the Collateral in
accordance with the Indenture, the Security and Guarantee Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and (b) the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries may incur Permitted
Collateral Liens; provided further, however, that no Security and Guarantee Document creating a lien on the
Collateral for the benefit of the Trustee and the holders of the Notes may be amended, extended, renewed,
restated, supplemented or otherwise modified, replaced, or released (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien
of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets) unless contemporaneously with such amendment, extension,
replacement, restatement, supplement, modification, renewal or release (followed by an immediate retaking of a
Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the assets), the Company delivers to the Trustee either (1) a solvency
opinion from an internationally recognized investment bank or accounting firm, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Trustee confirming the solvency of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after
giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, supplement, modification,
replacement or release, (2) a certificate from the board of directors or chief financial officer of the Company
(acting in good faith), that confirms the solvency of the Person granting such Lien after giving effect to any
transaction related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, replacement, supplement, modification
or release (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets), or


-----

(3) an opinion of counsel (subject to customary exceptions and qualifications), confirming that, after giving effect
to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification,
replacement or release, the Lien or Liens securing the Notes created under the Security and Guarantee
Documents so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, modified or replaced are valid and
perfected Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law,
that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal,
restatement, supplement, modification, replacement or release and retaking.

At the direction of the Company and without the consent of the holders of Notes, the Security Agent will from time
to time enter into one or more amendments to the Security and Guarantee Documents to (i) cure any ambiguity,
omission, defect or inconsistency therein, (ii) (but subject to compliance with the immediately preceding
paragraph) provide for Permitted Collateral Liens, (iii) add to the Collateral (iv) evidence the succession of another
Person to the Company or any Guarantor and the assumption by such successor of the obligations under the
Indenture, the Notes and the Security and Guarantee Documents, in each case, including in accordance with “—
_Certain Covenants—Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets”, (v) provide for the release of property and assets_
constituting Collateral from the Lien of the Security and Guarantee Documents and/or the release of the Note
Guarantee of a Guarantor, in each case, in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant Security and Guarantee Documents, in each
case, as applicable or (vi) make any other change thereto that does not adversely affect the rights of the holders
of the Notes in any material respect.

In the event that the Company complies with this covenant, the Trustee and the Security Agent will (subject to
customary protections and indemnifications) consent to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement, modification, replacement or release with no need for instructions from holders of the Notes.

**_Maintenance of Listing_**

The Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain the listing of the Notes on the
Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange for trading on the Euro MTF market for so long as such Notes are
outstanding; provided that if the Company is unable to obtain such admission to trading or if at any time the
Company determines that it will not maintain such listing, it will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
and maintain a listing of such Notes on another recognized stock exchange.

**_Further Assurances_**

The Issuer, the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries will execute any and all further documents, financing
statements, agreements and instruments, and take all further action that may be required under applicable law, in
order to grant, preserve, protect and perfect the validity and priority of the security interest created or intended to
be created by the Security and Guarantee Documents in the Collateral.

**_Payments for Consent_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, pay or cause to be paid
any consideration to or for the benefit of any holder for or as an inducement to any consent, waiver or amendment
of any of the terms or provisions of the Indenture, the Notes, the Security and Guarantee Documents, the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement unless such consideration is offered to be paid
and is paid to all holders that consent, waive or agree to amend in the time frame set forth in the solicitation
documents relating to such consent, waiver or agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and its
Restricted Subsidiaries will be permitted, in any offer or payment of consideration for, or as an inducement to, any
consent, waiver or amendment of any of the terms or provisions of the Indenture, to exclude holders of Notes in
any jurisdiction where (A)(i) the solicitation of such consent, waiver or amendment, including in connection with an
offer to purchase for cash, or (ii) the payment of the consideration therefor would require the Company or any of
its Restricted Subsidiaries to file a registration statement, prospectus or similar document under any applicable
securities laws (including, but not limited to, the United States federal securities laws and the laws of the
European Union or its member states), which the Company in its sole discretion determines (acting in good faith)
would be materially burdensome (it being understood that it would not be materially burdensome to file the
consent document(s) used in other jurisdictions, any substantially similar documents or any summary thereof with
the securities or financial services authorities in such jurisdiction); or (B) such solicitation would otherwise not be
permitted under applicable law in such jurisdiction.

**_Business Activities_**


-----

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary (other than the Issuer and any other
Financing Subsidiary) to, engage in any business other than Permitted Businesses, except to such extent as
would not be material to the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

**_The Issuer_**

The Issuer will not engage in any business activity or undertake any other activity, except any activity (a) relating
to the offering, sale or issuance of the Notes (including any Additional Notes) and Hedging Obligations or the
incurrence of Indebtedness by the Issuer represented by the Notes (including any Additional Notes), Hedging
Obligations or any other Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred by the Issuer by the provisions of the Indenture
described above under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred
_Stock and Disqualified Stock,” (b) undertaken with the purpose of, and directly related to, fulfilling its obligations_
under the Notes (including any Additional Notes), the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, Hedging Obligations or any other Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred by the Issuer by
the provisions of the Indenture described above under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Incurrence of
_Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock and Disqualified Stock” (including the lending of the proceeds from_
the Notes (including any Additional Notes or such Indebtedness) to the Company or another Guarantor pursuant
to the Funding Loans or similar loan or loans and granting Liens in respect of such loans to secure Indebtedness),
(c) permitted to be undertaken by the Issuer by the provisions of the Indenture described above under the caption
“—Certain Covenants—Restricted Payments,” (d) directly related to the establishment and maintenance of the
Issuer’s existence or (e) reasonably related to the foregoing. The Issuer will not (a) issue any Capital Stock (other
than to the Company or a Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary of the Company), or (b) undertake any transaction
that will require the Issuer to register as an “investment company” or an entity “controlled by an investment
company” as defined in the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended and the rules and regulations
thereunder.

The Issuer and the Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary or any other Person that is an
obligor under the Funding Loans, to (i) sell, dispose, encumber, prepay, repay, repurchase, redeem or otherwise
acquire, reduce or retire any amounts outstanding under the Funding Loans except in connection with any
redemption, repurchase or cancellation of the Notes or (ii) amend, modify, supplement or waive any rights under
the Funding Loans in a manner that would adversely affect the rights in any material respect of the Issuer except
as permitted by the Funding Loans, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or any
Security and Guarantee Documents.

**_Suspension of Certain Covenants when Notes Rated Investment Grade_**

If on any date following the Issue Date, (1) the Notes are rated Investment Grade Status by Moody’s and S&P (or,
if either Moody’s or S&P ceases to rate the Notes for reasons outside of the control of the Issuer or the Company,
the equivalent investment grade credit rating from Fitch or, in the absence of such, any other Nationally
Recognized Statistical Rating Organization selected by the Issuer or the Company as a replacement agency so
that the Notes are so rated by at least two such Rating Agencies); and (2) no Default or Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing, then, beginning on that day and subject to the provisions of the following
paragraph, the covenants specifically listed under the following captions in this Final Offering Memorandum will
be suspended and, in each case, any related default provision of the Indenture will cease to be effective and will
not be applicable to the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries:

(1) “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales;”

(2) “—Certain Covenants—Restricted Payments;”

(3) “—Certain Covenants—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock and Disqualified
_Stock;”_

(4) “—Certain Covenants—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Subsidiaries;”

(5) clause (4) of the covenant described under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Merger, Consolidation
_or Sale of Assets;”_

(6) “—Certain Covenants—Transactions with Affiliates;”

(7) “—Certain Covenants—Business Activities;” and

(8) “—Certain Covenants—Additional Note Guarantees.”


-----

During any period that the foregoing covenants have been suspended, the Company’s Board of Directors may not
designate any of its Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries pursuant to the covenant described under the
caption “—Certain Covenants—Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries” or the second paragraph
of the definition of “Unrestricted Subsidiary.”

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the rating assigned by any such Rating Agency should subsequently decline to
below Baa3 or BBB-, as applicable, the foregoing covenants will be reinstituted as of and from the date of such
rating decline. Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with respect to actions properly taken during the
period of suspension. Calculations under the reinstated “Restricted Payments” covenant will be made as if the
“Restricted Payments” covenant had been in effect since the Issue Date except that no Default or Event of Default
will be deemed to have occurred by reason of a Restricted Payment made while that covenant was suspended.
On the rating decline date, all Indebtedness incurred during the suspension period will be classified, at the
Issuer’s option, as having been incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described under the
caption “—Certain Covenants—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock and Disqualified
_Stock” or one or more of the clauses set forth in the second paragraph of such covenant (to the extent such_
Indebtedness would be permitted to be incurred thereunder as of the rating decline date and after giving effect to
Indebtedness incurred prior to the suspension period and outstanding on the rating decline date). To the extent
that such Indebtedness would be so permitted to be incurred under the first two paragraphs of the covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock and
_Disqualified Stock,” such Indebtedness will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is_
classified under clause (2) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—
_Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock and Disqualified Stock.”_

**Reports**

The Company will (x) make available to the investor website service maintained by Bloomberg L.P. (or if such
service website is no longer maintained or accessible for these purposes, a similar service) or (y) post on its
website, and in either case provide the Trustee the following reports:

(1) within 120 days after the end of the Company’s fiscal year, annual reports containing the following
information: (a) audited consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of the end of the two most
recent fiscal years and audited consolidated income statements and cash flow of the Company for the
three most recent fiscal years, including appropriate footnotes to such financial statements, and the
report of the independent auditors on the financial statements; (b) pro forma income statement and
balance sheet information, together with summary explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions,
dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of the most recently completed
fiscal year; (c) to the extent relating to annual periods, an operating and financial review of the audited
financial statements, including a discussion of the results of operations, financial condition, and
liquidity and capital resources, and a discussion of material commitments and contingencies and
critical accounting policies; (d) a description of the business, management and shareholders of the
Company, all material affiliate transactions and a description of all material contractual arrangements,
including material debt instruments; and (e) material risk factors and material recent developments;

(2) within 60 days (except as provided below in relation to any Semi-Annual Report, as defined below)
following the end of the first three fiscal quarters in each fiscal year of the Company all quarterly
financial statements containing the following information: (a) an unaudited condensed consolidated
balance sheet as of the end of such quarter and unaudited condensed statements of income and cash
flow for the year-to-date period ending on the unaudited condensed balance sheet date, and the
comparable prior year periods, together with condensed footnote disclosure; (b) pro forma income
statement and balance sheet information, together with summary explanatory footnotes, for any
material acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of the
most recently completed fiscal quarter; (c) an operating and financial review of the unaudited financial
statements, including a discussion of the results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity and
capital resources, and a discussion of material commitments and contingencies and critical accounting
policies; and (d) material recent developments; provided that the report provided by the Company
following the completion of the second quarter of each year (the “Semi-Annual Report”) will include in
addition a description of any material changes to all material contractual arrangements, including
material debt instruments and to material affiliate transactions; and provided further that such SemiAnnual Report need not be provided by the Company until 75 days after the end of the second quarter
of each year; and


-----

(3) promptly after the occurrence of a material acquisition, disposition, restructuring, senior management
or board of directors’ changes or change in auditors, a report containing a description of such event.

All financial statement and pro forma financial information will be prepared on a consistent basis for the periods
presented and the financial statements required under clause (1) may be presented in the same format as in this
Final Offering Memorandum; provided, however, that the reports set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above may, in
the event of a change in GAAP, present earlier periods on a basis that applied to such periods, subject to the
provisions of the Indenture. No report need include separate financial statements or financial data for any
Guarantors or non-guarantor Subsidiaries of the Company; provided that the annual report in clause (1) will
include a statement of the aggregate percentages of the adjusted EBITDA and total assets of the Company
represented by the Guarantors.

At any time that any of the Company’s Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries, then the quarterly and annual
financial information required by the preceding paragraph will include a reasonably detailed presentation, either
on the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, and in the operating and financial review of the
financial condition and results of operations of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the
financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries (taken together) of the Company.

In addition, so long as the Notes remain outstanding and during any period during which the Company is not
subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act nor exempt therefrom pursuant to Rule 12g3-2(b), the
Company will furnish to the holders, upon their request, the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule
144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act.

If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted for
trading on the Euro MTF market and the rules of that exchange will so require, the above information will also be
made available in Luxembourg through the office of the Registrar or the registered office of the Issuer.

**Additional or Amended Intercreditor Agreements**

At the request of the Issuer, without the consent of holders of the Notes, in connection with the incurrence by the
Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries of any Indebtedness permitted to be incurred or secured under the
Indenture, the Company, the Issuer, the relevant Restricted Subsidiaries, the Trustee and the Security Agent will
enter into with the holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly authorized representatives) an intercreditor
agreement (an “Additional Intercreditor Agreement”) on substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor
Agreement (or terms not materially less favorable to the holders (provided that the Trustee and the Security Agent
shall have received an officer’s certificate to that effect)); provided that such Additional Intercreditor Agreement
will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or the Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or
the Security Agent, adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee or the Security Agent,
as the case may be, under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement.

At the direction of the Issuer and without the consent of holders of the Notes, the Trustee and the Security Agent
will from time to time enter into one or more amendments to any Intercreditor Agreement to: (1) cure any
ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency of any such agreement, (2) increase the amount or types of
Indebtedness covered by any such agreement that may be incurred by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary
that is subject to any such agreement (including with respect to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional
Intercreditor Agreement the addition of provisions relating to new Indebtedness ranking junior in right of payment
to the Notes), (3) add Restricted Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, (4) secure the Notes (including Additional Notes), (5) make provision for equal and ratable pledges of
the Collateral to secure Additional Notes or other Indebtedness permitted to be secured by the Indenture,
(6) implement any Permitted Collateral Liens, (7) amend the Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor
Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof or (8) make any other change to any such agreement that does
not adversely affect the holders of the Notes in any material respect (provided that the Trustee and the Security
Agent shall have received an officer’s certificate and legal opinion to that effect). The Issuer may only direct the
Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to the extent such amendment does not impose any
personal obligations on the Trustee or the Security Agent, in the opinion of the Trustee or the Security Agent, or
adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee under the Indenture, any Intercreditor
Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

Each holder, by accepting a Note, will be deemed to have agreed to and accepted the terms and conditions of the
Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement (whether then entered into or entered into in the
future pursuant to the provisions described herein).

notice by the Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes or by the holders of at least 25% in
aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes to comply with the provisions described
under the captions “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders” and “—Certain Covenants” (in each case,
other than a failure to purchase Notes which will constitute an Event of Default under clause (2) above
and a failure to comply with the provisions described under the caption “—Certain Covenants—
_Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets” described in clause (3) above);_

(5) failure by the Issuer or the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries for 60 days after written

in the Indenture;

(6) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be outstanding or by
which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Company or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is guaranteed by the Company or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries) whether such Indebtedness or guarantee now exists, or is created after the
date of the Indenture, if that default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on such Indebtedness
prior to the expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness on the date of such
default (a “Payment Default”); or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its scheduled maturity;

and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount
of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a Payment Default or the maturity of
which has been so accelerated, which exceed €15 million in the aggregate;

(7) failure by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to pay final judgments (which are not

aggregate, which judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for a period of 60 consecutive days;

(8) except as permitted by the Indenture, any Note Guarantee of the Company or any Significant
Subsidiary of the Notes is held in any judicial proceeding to be unenforceable or invalid or ceases for
any reason to be in full force and effect or any Guarantor denies or disaffirms in writing its obligations
under its Note Guarantee;
(9) any security interest under the Security and Guarantee Documents, at any time, ceases to be in full
force and effect (other than in accordance with the relevant Security and Guarantee Documents, the
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) for any reason other
than satisfaction in full of all obligations of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries under the
Indenture or the release of any such security interest in accordance with the Security and Guarantee
Documents, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, or
the Indenture or any security interest created pursuant to the Indenture and the Security and
Guarantee Documents is declared invalid or unenforceable or the Company assents in writing that any
such security interest is invalid or unenforceable or any pledgor disaffirms in writing its obligations
under the Security and Guarantee Documents and any such Default continues for 10 days;

(10) default under any other Indebtedness that is secured by the Collateral if such default results in the
creditors under such Indebtedness commencing an enforcement action of their security rights over the
Collateral; and


-----

(11) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency described in the Indenture with respect to the Company or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that is a Significant Subsidiary or any group of Restricted
Subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary.

In the case of an Event of Default arising from certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency, with respect to the
Company, any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Significant Subsidiary or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that,
taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary, all outstanding Notes will become due and payable
immediately without further action or notice. If any other Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or
the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may declare all the Notes
to be due and payable immediately.

Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and may not enforce the
Security and Guarantee Documents except as provided in such Security and Guarantee Documents and the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement. Subject to certain limitations, holders of a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any
trust or power. The Trustee may withhold from holders notice of any continuing Default or Event of Default if it
determines that withholding notice is in their interest, except a Default or Event of Default relating to the payment
of principal, premium, interest or Additional Amounts.

The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding by notice to the Trustee
may on behalf of the holders of all the Notes waive any existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences
under the Indenture except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of premium, interest or
Additional Amounts on, or the principal of, the Notes.

The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding compliance with the Indenture.
Upon becoming aware of any Default or Event of Default that would give either the Trustee or the holders of at
least 25% or more in aggregate principal amount of Notes then outstanding the right to declare the Notes
immediately due and payable, the Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee a statement specifying such Default
or Event of Default.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Stockholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder of the Issuer, the Company or any other Guarantor, as
such, will have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer, the Company or the other Guarantors under the
Notes, the Indenture, the Note Guarantees, the Security and Guarantee Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement
or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such
obligations or their creation. Each holder by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver
and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. The waiver may not be effective to waive
liabilities under the Federal securities laws of the United States.
**Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance**

The Issuer may, at its option or the option of the Company, and at any time, elect to have all its obligations
discharged with respect to the outstanding Notes and all obligations of the Company and any other Guarantors
discharged with respect to their Note Guarantees (“Legal Defeasance”) except for:

(1) the rights of holders of outstanding Notes to receive payments in respect of the principal of, or interest
or premium, and Additional Amounts, if any, on such Notes when such payments are due from the
trust referred to below;

(2) the Issuer’s obligations with respect to the Notes concerning issuing temporary Notes, registration of
Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for
payment and money for security payments held in trust;

(3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee, and the Issuer’s, the Company’s and
any other Guarantor’s obligations in connection therewith; and

(4) the Legal Defeasance provisions of the Indenture.

In addition, the Issuer may, at its option or the option of the Company, and at any time, elect to have the
obligations of the Issuer, the Company and any other Guarantors released with respect to certain covenants that
are described in the Indenture (“Covenant Defeasance”) and thereafter any omission to comply with those
covenants will not constitute a Default or Event of Default with respect to the Notes. In the event Covenant
Defeasance occurs, certain events (not including non-payment, bankruptcy, receivership, rehabilitation and


-----

insolvency events) described under “—Events of Default and Remedies” will no longer constitute an Event of
Default with respect to the Notes.

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance:

(1) the Issuer must irrevocably deposit or cause to be deposited with the Trustee or another entity
designated by the Trustee for such purposes, in trust, for the benefit of the holders of the Notes, cash
in euro, non-callable Government Securities, or a combination of cash in euro and non-callable
Government Securities, in amounts as will be sufficient, in the opinion of an internationally recognized
firm of independent public accountants, to pay the principal of, or interest and premium, and Additional
Amounts, if any, on the outstanding Notes on the stated maturity or on the applicable redemption date,
as the case may be, and the Issuer must specify whether the Notes are being defeased to maturity or
to a particular redemption date;

(2) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an opinion of counsel
confirming that (a) the Issuer has received from, or there has been published by, the United States
Internal Revenue Service a ruling or (b) since the date of the Indenture, there has been a change in
the applicable Federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such opinion
of counsel will confirm that, the holders of the outstanding Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss
for Federal income tax purposes as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to Federal
income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the
case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred;

(3) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an opinion of counsel
confirming that the holders of the outstanding Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for United
States Federal income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to
United States Federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times
as would have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred;

(4) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing on the date of such deposit (other than a
Default or Event of Default resulting from the borrowing of funds to be applied to such deposit);

(5) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance will not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute
a default under any material agreement or instrument (other than the Indenture) to which the Issuer,
the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Issuer, the Company or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries is bound;

(6) the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an officer’s certificate stating that the deposit was not made or
caused to be made by the Issuer with the intent of preferring the holders over the other creditors of the
Issuer or of the Company with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors of the
Issuer or the Company or others; and

(7) the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an officer’s certificate and an opinion of counsel, each stating
that all conditions precedent relating to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant Defeasance have been
complied with.

**Amendment, Supplement and Waiver**

Except as provided in the next two succeeding paragraphs, the Indenture, the Notes, the Note Guarantees, the
Security and Guarantee Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement may
be amended or supplemented with the consent of the holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the
Notes then outstanding (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or
tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes), and any existing default or compliance with any provision of the
Indenture, the Notes, the Note Guarantees, the Security and Guarantee Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement
or any Additional Intercreditor may be waived with the consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of
the then outstanding Notes (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or
tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes); provided that, if any amendment, supplement or waiver will only
amend, supplement or waive provisions with respect to one series of the Notes, only the consent of a majority in
aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes of such series will be required. For so long as the Notes
are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted for trading on the Euro MTF market
and the rules of this exchange so require, the Issuer will inform the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and publish a
notice of any such amendment, supplement or waiver in a newspaper having a general circulation in Luxembourg


-----

(currently expected to be the Luxemburger Wort) or the website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange
(www.bourse.lu).

Without the consent of holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of then outstanding Notes
affected (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or
exchange offer for, the Notes), an amendment, supplement or waiver may not (with respect to any Notes held by
a non-consenting holder):

(1) reduce the aggregate principal amount of Notes whose holders must consent to an amendment,
supplement or waiver;

(2) reduce the principal of or change the scheduled maturity of any Note or alter the provisions with
respect to the redemption of the Notes (other than provisions relating to the covenants described
above under the caption “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders”);

(3) reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest on any Note;

(4) waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of, or interest, premium, or Additional
Amounts, if any, on the Notes (except a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the holders of at
least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes and a waiver of the payment default that
resulted from such acceleration);
(5) make any Note payable in money other than that stated in such Note;

(6) make any change in the provisions of the Indenture relating to waivers of past Defaults or the rights of
holders of Notes to receive payments of principal of, or interest, premium, or Additional Amounts, if
any, on the Notes;

(7) waive a redemption payment with respect to any Note (other than a payment required by one of the
covenants described above under the caption “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders”);

(8) release the Company or any other Guarantor from any of its obligations under its Note Guarantee or
the Indenture, except in accordance with the terms of the Indenture;

(9) release the security interest granted for the benefit of the holders of the Notes in the Collateral other
than pursuant to the terms of the Security and Guarantee Documents or as otherwise permitted by the
Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement; or

(10) make any change in the preceding amendment and waiver provisions;

_provided that, if any amendment, supplement or waiver will only amend, supplement or waive such provisions_
with respect to one series of the Notes, only the consent of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the
then outstanding Notes of such series will be required.

Notwithstanding the preceding, without the consent of any holder of Notes, the Issuer, the Company and the other
Guarantors, the Trustee, the Security Agent and the other parties thereto may amend or supplement the
Indenture, the Notes or the Note Guarantees, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
or the Security and Guarantee Documents:

(1) to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency, to conform any provision of the Indenture to
the “Description of the Notes” as set forth in the Final Offering Memorandum or to reduce the minimum
denomination of the Notes;

(2) to provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of Definitive Registered Notes;

(3) to provide for the assumption of the Company’s obligations to holders in the case of a merger or
consolidation or sale or disposition of all or substantially all the Company’s assets;

(4) to make such changes as are necessary to provide for the issuance of Additional Notes in compliance
with the covenants described herein, or to add guarantees in favor of the Notes;

(5) to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a security interest in favor of the Security Agent to the
extent necessary to grant a security interest for the benefit of any Person; provided that the granting of
such security interest is not prohibited by the Indenture;

(6) to add additional assets or property as Collateral;

(7) to enter into additional or supplemental Security and Guarantee Documents;

(8) to release any Note Guarantee in accordance with the terms of the Indenture;


-----

(9) to add additional parties to the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or any
Security and Guarantee Document to the extent permitted hereunder or thereunder and to make
changes contemplated under, or to enter into an Additional Intercreditor Agreement pursuant to the
provisions under, the caption “—Certain Covenants—Additional or Amended Intercreditor Agreement;”
(10) to confirm and evidence the release, termination, discharge or retaking of any guarantee or Lien
(including the Collateral and the Security and Guarantee Documents) with respect to or securing the
Notes when such release, termination, discharge or retaking is provided for under the Indenture, the
Security and Guarantee Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement; or

(11) to make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the holders or that does not
adversely affect the legal rights under the Indenture of any such holder in any material respect.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to all Notes issued thereunder, when:

(1) either:

(a) all Notes that have been authenticated, except lost, stolen or destroyed Notes that have been
replaced or paid and Notes for whose payment money has been deposited in trust and
thereafter repaid to the Issuer, have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or

(b) all Notes that have not been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation have become due and
payable by reason of the mailing of a notice of redemption or otherwise or will become due and
payable within one year and the Issuer, the Company or any other Guarantor has irrevocably
deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee or another entity designated by the
Trustee for such purpose as trust funds in trust solely for the benefit of the holders, cash in
euro, non-callable Government Securities, or a combination of cash in euro and non-callable
Government Securities, in an aggregate amount as will be sufficient without consideration of
any reinvestment of interest, to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on the Notes not
delivered to the Trustee for cancellation for principal, premium, Additional Amounts, if any, and
accrued interest to the date of maturity or redemption;

(2) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing on the date of such deposit or will occur
as a result of such deposit and such deposit will not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a
default under, any other instrument to which the Issuer, the Company or any other Guarantor is a party
or by which the Issuer, the Company or any other Guarantor is bound;

(3) the Issuer, the Company or any other Guarantor has paid or caused to be paid all sums payable by it
under the Indenture; and

(4) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee under the Indenture to apply the
deposited money toward the payment of the Notes at maturity or the redemption date, as the case may
be.

In addition, the Issuer must deliver an officer’s certificate and an opinion of counsel to the Trustee stating that all
conditions precedent to satisfaction and discharge have been satisfied.

**Concerning the Trustee**

The Trustee will be permitted to engage in transactions with the Issuer, the Company or any other Guarantor;
however, if it acquires any conflicting interest it must eliminate such conflict within 90 days of becoming aware of
such conflict or resign. If the Trustee becomes the owner or pledge of the Notes it may deal with the Issuer with
the same rights it would have if it were not the Trustee, Paying Agent, Registrar or such other agent.

The holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes will have the right to direct the time,
method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the Trustee, subject to
certain exceptions. The Indenture provides that in case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee
will be required, in the exercise of its power, to use the degree of care of a prudent man in the conduct of his own
affairs. The Trustee undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in the
Indenture, and no implied covenants or obligations can be read into the Indenture against the Trustee. The
Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Indenture at the request of


-----

any holder of Notes, unless such holder has provided to the Trustee security, indemnity or pre-funding
satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense.

**Judgment Currency**

Any payment on account of an amount that is payable in euro (the “Required Currency”) which is made to or for
the account of any holder of a Note in lawful currency of any other jurisdiction (the “Other Currency”) whether as a
result of any judgment or order or the enforcement thereof or the realization of any security or the liquidation of
any of the Issuer, Company or any other Guarantor will constitute a discharge of the Issuer’s, Company’s or such
Guarantor’s obligation under the Indenture, the Notes or the Note Guarantees, as the case may be, only to the
extent of the amount of the Required Currency which such holder could purchase in the New York foreign
exchange markets with the amount of the Other Currency in accordance with normal banking procedures at the
rate of exchange prevailing on the first day (other than a Saturday or Sunday) on which banks in New York, are
generally open for business following receipt of the payment first referred to above. If the amount of the Required
Currency that could be so purchased is less than the amount of the Required Currency originally due to such
holder, the Issuer, Company or such other Guarantor, as the case may be, will indemnify and save harmless such
holder from and against all loss or damage arising out of or as a result of such deficiency. This indemnity will
constitute an obligation separate and independent from the other obligations contained in the Indenture, the Notes
or the Note Guarantees, will give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, will apply irrespective of any
indulgence granted by any holder of a Note from time to time and will continue in full force and effect
notwithstanding any judgment or order for a liquidated sum in respect of an amount due hereunder or under any
judgment or order.

**Additional Information**

Anyone who receives this offering memorandum may obtain a copy of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement,
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Security and Guarantee Documents and the Funding Loan
Agreements without charge at the registered office of the Issuer or at the office of the Registrar in Luxembourg, or

regard to its conflict of laws rules, and New York courts have jurisdiction over any action or proceeding arising out
of these agreements.

(b) the aggregate amount of Consolidated EBITDA for the period of the most recent four consecutive fiscal
quarters ending prior to the date of such determination for which consolidated financial statements of that Person
are available. In the event that the specified Person or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries incurs, assumes,
guarantees, repays, repurchases, redeems, defeases or otherwise discharges any Indebtedness (other than
ordinary working capital borrowings) or issues, repurchases or redeems Disqualified Stock or preferred stock
subsequent to the commencement of the period for which the Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio is
being calculated and on or prior to the date on which the event for which the calculation of the Consolidated
Senior Secured Leverage Ratio is made (for the purpose of this definition, the “Consolidated Senior Secured
_Leverage Ratio Calculation Date”), then the Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio will be calculated giving_
pro forma effect to such incurrence, assumption, guarantee, repayment, repurchase or redemption of
Indebtedness, or such issuance, repurchase or redemption of Disqualified Stock or preferred stock, and the use
of the proceeds therefrom as if the same had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter reference
period.

In addition, for purposes of calculating the Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio:

(1) acquisitions that have been made by the specified Person or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries,
including through mergers or consolidations, or by any Person or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
acquired by the specified Person or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, and including any related
financing transactions and increases in ownership of Subsidiaries which are Restricted Subsidiaries,
during the four-quarter reference period or subsequent to such reference period and on or prior to the

had occurred on the first day of the four-quarter reference period and Consolidated EBITDA for such
reference period will be calculated on a pro forma basis;

Calculation Date will be deemed not to have been a Restricted Subsidiary at any time during such
four-quarter period.

For purposes of this definition, whenever pro forma effect is to be given to an acquisition of assets, the amount of
income or earnings relating thereto and the amount of Consolidated Interest Expense associated with any
Indebtedness incurred in connection therewith, the pro forma calculations will be determined in good faith by a
responsible financial or accounting officer of the Company (and may include anticipated expense and cost
reductions and cost synergies). If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and is being given pro forma
effect, the interest on such Indebtedness will be calculated as if the rate in effect on the date of determination had
been the applicable rate for the entire period (taking into account any Hedging Obligation applicable to such
Indebtedness). For purposes of this definition, whenever pro forma effect is to be given to any Indebtedness


-----

incurred pursuant to a revolving credit facility, the amount outstanding on the date of such calculation will be
computed based on (1) the average daily balance of such Indebtedness during such four fiscal quarters or such
shorter period for which the facility was outstanding or (2) if such facility was created after the end of such four
fiscal quarters, the average daily balance of such Indebtedness during the period from the date of creation of such
facility to the date of such calculation. Interest on Indebtedness that may optionally be determined at an interest

based upon the rate actually chosen or, if none, then based upon such optional rate chosen as the relevant
Person may designate.

otherwise, or redeemable at the option of the holder of the Capital Stock, in whole or in part, on or prior to the


-----

date that is 365 days after the date on which the Notes mature. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, any
Capital Stock that would constitute Disqualified Stock solely because the holders of the Capital Stock have the
right to require the Company to repurchase such Capital Stock upon the occurrence of a Change of Control or an
Asset Sale will not constitute Disqualified Stock if the terms of such Capital Stock provide that the Company may

described under “—Certain Covenants—Transactions with Affiliates” can be undertaken (a “Tested Transaction”),
the Euro Equivalent of such Indebtedness, Investment or transaction described in the covenant described under

For purposes of this definition, whenever pro forma effect is to be given to an acquisition of assets, the amount of
income or earnings relating thereto and the amount of Consolidated Interest Expense associated with any
Indebtedness incurred in connection therewith, the pro forma calculations will be determined in good faith by a
responsible financial or accounting officer of the Company (and may include anticipated expense and cost

Indebtedness). For purposes of this definition, whenever pro forma effect is to be given to any Indebtedness
incurred pursuant to a revolving credit facility, the amount outstanding on the date of such calculation will be
computed based on (1) the average daily balance of such Indebtedness during such four fiscal quarters or such
shorter period for which the facility was outstanding or (2) if such facility was created after the end of such four
fiscal quarters, the average daily balance of such Indebtedness during the period from the date of creation of such

# Book-Entry; Delivery and Form

**General**

Certain defined terms used but not defined in this section have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture,
as described in the “Description of the Notes”.

Notes sold to “qualified institutional buyers” as defined in Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act (“Rule 144A”)
in reliance on Rule 144A will initially be represented by a global note in registered form without interest coupons
attached (the “Rule 144A Global Note”). Notes sold to persons outside the United States in offshore transactions
(as defined in Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act (“Regulation S”)) in reliance on Regulation S will initially
be represented by a global note in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Regulation S Global
_Note” and, together with the Rule 144A Global Note, the “Global Notes”). The Global Notes will be deposited, on_
the closing date, with, or on behalf of, a common depositary and registered in the name of the nominee of the
common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Note (“Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests”) and ownership of
interests in the Regulation S Global Note (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests” and, together with the
Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests, the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have accounts with
Euroclear and/or Clearstream or persons that hold interests through such participants and has to be in
accordance with applicable transfer restrictions set out in the Indenture and in any applicable securities laws of
any state of the United States or of any other jurisdiction. See “Notice to Prospective Investors”, “Notice to Certain
_European Investors” and “Notice to Investors”. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in the Global Notes_
on behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of
their respective depositaries. Except under the limited circumstances described below, Book-Entry Interests will
not be held in definitive certificated form.

Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records maintained in
book-entry form by Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants pursuant to customary procedures and
subject to the applicable rules and procedures established by Euroclear or Clearstream and their respective
participants. Except under the limited circumstances described below, owners of beneficial interests in the Global
Notes will not be entitled to receive definitive notes in registered form (“Definitive Registered Notes”). Instead,
Euroclear and Clearstream will credit on their respective book-entry registration and transfer systems a
participant’s account with the interest beneficially owned by such participant. The laws of some jurisdictions,
including certain states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical
delivery of such securities in definitive certificated form. The foregoing limitations may impair the ability to own,
transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while the Notes are in global form, holders of Book-Entry
Interests will not be considered the owners or “holders” of Notes for any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable (or their respective
nominees), will be considered the sole holders of Global Notes for all purposes under the Indenture governing the
Notes. As such, participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, and indirect
participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear, Clearstream and the participants through which they own
Book-Entry Interests, to transfer their interests or to exercise any rights of holders under the Indenture governing
the Notes.

Neither the Issuer, the Guarantor nor the Trustee under the Indenture governing the Notes will have any
responsibility, or be liable, for any aspect of the records relating to the Book-Entry Interests.
**Redemption of the Global Notes**

In the event that any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream (or their
respective nominees), as applicable, will redeem an equal amount of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note
from the amount received by it in respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The redemption price payable in
connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by Euroclear
and/or Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof).
The Issuer understands that, under the existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all the Notes
are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their respective participants’ accounts on a
proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions), by lot or on such other basis as they deem fair and
appropriate; provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest of less than €100,000 principal amount may be
redeemed in part.


-----

**Payments on Global Notes**

Payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal, premium, interest and
additional amounts) will be made by the Issuer to the Principal Paying Agent. The Principal Paying Agent will, in
turn, make such payments to the common depositary or its nominee for Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable.
The common depositary or its nominee will in turn distribute such payments to participants in accordance with its
procedures. The Issuer will make payments of all such amounts without deduction or withholding for or on
account of any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature except
as may be required by law.

The Issuer expects that standing customer instructions and customary practices will govern payments by
participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through such participants, as is now the case with securities
held for the accounts of customers registered in “street name”. Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry
Interests held through participants are the responsibility of such participants, as is now the case with securities
held for the accounts of customers registered in “street name”.

In order to tender Book-Entry Interests in a change of control offer or asset sale offer, the holder of the applicable
Global Note must, within the time period specified in such offer, give notice of such tender to the Principal Paying
Agent and specify the principal amount of Book-Entry Interests to be tendered.

Under the terms of the Indenture governing the Notes, the Issuer and the Trustee will treat the registered holder
of the Global Notes (e.g., Euroclear or Clearstream (or their respective nominees)) as the owner thereof for the
purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, none of the Issuer, the Trustee or any of
its or their respective agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

- any aspect of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or
payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records of
Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a
Book-Entry Interest; or

- Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant.

The Notes will be issued in denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. We
will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Notes; however, owners of the Book-Entry Interest may
incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts in Euroclear or Clearstream.
**Currency of Payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Global Notes
will be paid in euro. Payments will be subject in all cases to any fiscal or other laws and regulations (including any
regulations of the applicable clearing system) applicable thereto.

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that they will take any action permitted to be taken by a
holder of Notes (including the presentation of Notes for exchange as described above) only at the direction of one
or more participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in
respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of Notes as to which such participant or participants has
or have given such direction. Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of
consents, waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is an event of
default under the Notes, Euroclear and Clearstream reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for Definitive
Registered Notes, and to distribute Definitive Registered Notes to its participants.

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in accordance with Euroclear and
Clearstream rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder requires physical delivery of
Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell Notes to persons in states which require physical
delivery of securities or to pledge such securities, such holder must transfer its interests in the Global Notes in
accordance with the normal procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and in accordance with the procedures set
forth in the Indenture.

The Rule 144A Global Note will have a legend to the effect set forth under “Notice to Investors”. Book-Entry
Interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers and certification requirements
discussed under “Notice to Investors”.


-----

Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Regulation S
Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the
Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144 under the
U.S. Securities Act or any other exemption (if available under the U.S. Securities Act).

Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Rule 144A
Book-Entry Interest denominated in the same currency only upon delivery by the transferor of a written
certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who
the transferor reasonably believes is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A in a
transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions
described under “Notice to Investors” and in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any other
jurisdiction.

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for a Rule 144A BookEntry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the
Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the Rule 144A Global Note.

Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of
a Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the firstmentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in such other Global Note, and accordingly will
thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in
such other Global Note for as long as it remains such a Book-Entry Interest.
**Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indenture governing the Notes, owners of the Book-Entry Interests will receive Definitive
Registered Notes only in the following circumstances:

- if Euroclear or Clearstream notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as depositary and
a successor depositary is not appointed by the Issuer within 120 days; or

- if the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through Euroclear or
Clearstream following an Event of Default which results in action by the Trustee pursuant to the enforcement
provisions under the Indenture.

Euroclear has advised the Issuer that upon request by an owner of a Book-Entry Interest described above, its
current procedure is to request that Definitive Registered Notes be issued to all owners of Book-Entry Interests
and not only to the owner who made the initial request.

In any such events described above, the Registrar will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name
or names, and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream
(in accordance with their respective customary procedures and certain certification requirements and based upon
directions received from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of the Book-Entry Interests). The
Definitive Registered Notes will bear a restrictive legend with respect to certain transfer restrictions, unless that
legend is not required by the Indenture or by applicable law.

In the case of the issuance of Definitive Registered Notes, the holder of a Definitive Registered Note may transfer
such note by surrendering it to the registrar or a transfer agent. In the event of a partial transfer or a partial
redemption of a holding of Definitive Registered Notes represented by one Definitive Registered Note, a Definitive
Registered Note will be issued to the transferee in respect of the part transferred and a new Definitive Registered
Note in respect of the balance of the holding not transferred or redeemed will be issued to the transferor or the
holder, as applicable; provided that no Definitive Registered Note in a denomination less than €100,000 will be
issued. The Issuer will bear the cost of preparing, printing, packaging and delivering the Definitive Registered
Notes.

The Issuer will not be required to register the transfer or exchange of Definitive Registered Notes for a period of
15 calendar days preceding (i) the record date for any payment of interest on the Notes; (ii) any date fixed for
redemption of the Notes; or (iii) the date fixed for selection of the Notes to be redeemed in part. Also, the Issuer is
not required to register the transfer or exchange of any Notes selected for redemption or which the holder has
tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a change of control offer or asset sale offer. In the
event of the transfer of any Definitive Registered Note, the trustee may require a holder, among other things, to
furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents as described in the Indenture. The Issuer may require
a holder to pay any transfer taxes and fees required by law and permitted by the Indenture and the Notes.


-----

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such a Definitive Registered Note has
been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, or if such Definitive Registered Note is mutilated and is surrendered to
the registrar or at the office of a transfer agent, the Issuer will issue and the Trustee will authenticate a
replacement Definitive Registered Note if the Trustee’s and the Issuer’s requirements are met. The Issuer or the
Trustee may require a holder requesting replacement of a Definitive Registered Note to furnish an indemnity bond
sufficient in the judgment of both to protect themselves, the Trustee or the paying agent appointed pursuant to the
Indenture from any loss which any of them may suffer if a Definitive Registered Note is replaced. The Issuer may
charge for its expenses incurred in replacing a Definitive Registered Note.

In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about to
become due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by the Issuer pursuant to the provisions of the
Indenture, the Issuer, in its discretion, may, instead of issuing a new Definitive Registered Note, pay, redeem or
purchase such Definitive Registered Note, as the case may be.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note only in
accordance with the Indenture and, if required, only after the transferor first delivers to the trustee a written
certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the transfer
restrictions applicable to such Notes. See “Notice to Investors”.

So long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer will publish a notice of any issuance of Definitive Registered
Notes in a newspaper having general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger Wort).
Payment of principal, any repurchase price, premium and interest on Definitive Registered Notes will be payable
at the office of the paying agent in Luxembourg or at the registered office of the Issuer so long as the Notes are
listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so
require.

**Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, as
applicable. The Issuer provides the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the
convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that
settlement system and may be changed at any time. Neither the Issuer nor the Initial Purchasers are responsible
for those operations or procedures.

The Issuer understands as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream. Euroclear and Clearstream hold
securities for participating organizations. They also facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities
transactions between their respective participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of such
participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping,
administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and
Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial
institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other
organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers,
dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodian relationship with a Euroclear or
Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect
participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or
entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of
such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions
require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to
transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the
Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the 144A Global Notes only through
Euroclear or Clearstream participants.

**Global Clearance and Settlement Under the Book-Entry System**

The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange and admitted to trading on the Euro MTF market. Transfers of interests in the Global Notes between
participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with their respective
rules and operating procedures.


-----

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of
interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, they are under
no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued or
modified at any time. None of the Issuer, the Trustee or paying agent will have any responsibility for the
performance by Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective participants or indirect participants of their respective
obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in Euros. Book-Entry Interests owned through Euroclear or
Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional bonds in registered form.
Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream holders on
the business day following the settlement date against payment for value of the settlement date.

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear or Clearstream and will settle in same-day
funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of trading of any
Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are located to ensure that settlement
can be made on the desired value date.

# EU, Spanish, Portuguese and Luxembourg Insolvency Laws

**European Union Insolvency**

The Issuer and the Guarantors are incorporated and/or organized under the laws of Member States of the
European Union.

Pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) no. 1346/2000 on insolvency proceedings, as amended (the “EU Insolvency
_Regulation”), which applies within the European Union (other than Denmark), the courts of the Member State in_
which a company’s “centre of main interests” (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation)
is situated have jurisdiction to open main insolvency proceedings. The determination of where a company has its
centre of main interests is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member States may have differing
and even conflicting views.

Although there is a rebuttable presumption under Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation that a company has
its centre of main interests in the Member State in which it has its registered office in the absence of proof to the
contrary, paragraph 13 of the Preamble to the EU Insolvency Regulation states that the centre of main interests of
a debtor “should correspond to the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular
basis and is therefore ascertainable by third parties”. The courts have taken into consideration a number of
factors in determining the centre of main interests of a company, including in particular where board meetings are
held, the location where the company conducts the majority of its business or has its head office and the location
where the majority of the company’s creditors are established. A company’s centre of main interests may change
from time to time but is determined for the purposes of deciding which courts have competent jurisdiction to open
insolvency proceedings at the time of the filing of the insolvency petition.

The EU Insolvency Regulation applies to insolvency proceedings that are collective insolvency proceedings of the
types referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation.

If the centre of main interests of a company is in one Member State (other than Denmark) under Article 3(2) of the
EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to open
insolvency proceedings against that company only if such company has an “establishment” in the territory of such
other Member State. An “establishment” is defined as a place of operations where the company carries on nontransitory economic activity with human means and goods. The effects of those insolvency proceedings opened in
that other Member State are restricted to the assets of the company situated in such other Member State.

Where main proceedings have been opened in the Member State in which the company has its centre of main
interests, any proceedings opened subsequently in another Member State in which the company has an
establishment (secondary proceedings) are limited to “winding-up proceedings” listed in Annex B of the EU
Insolvency Regulation. Where main proceedings in the Member State in which the company has its centre of
main interests have not yet been opened, territorial insolvency proceedings can be opened in another Member
State where the company has an establishment only where either: (a) insolvency proceedings cannot be opened
in the Member State in which the company’s centre of main interests is situated under that Member State’s law; or
(b) the territorial insolvency proceedings are opened at the request of a creditor that is domiciled, habitually
resident or has its registered office in the other Member State or whose claim arises from the operation of that
establishment.

The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court opening main
proceedings, which will be given the same effect in the other Member States, so long as no secondary
proceedings have been opened there. The liquidator appointed by a court in a Member State that has jurisdiction
to open main proceedings (because the company’s centre of main interests is there) may exercise the powers
conferred on him by the law of that Member State in another Member State (such as to remove assets of the
company from that other Member State), subject to certain limitations, so long as no insolvency proceedings have
been opened in that other Member State or any preservation measure taken to the contrary further to a request to
open insolvency proceedings in that other Member State where the company has assets.

**Spanish Insolvency Laws**

Under Spanish insolvency law, your right to receive payments of interest and principal on the Notes in case of
insolvency may be more limited than would be the case under U.S. bankruptcy laws.


-----

Spanish insolvency Law 22/2003, as amended, governs certain out-of court restructurings or refinancings and
court insolvency proceedings. This section summarizes the main aspects of Spanish insolvency law affecting
corporations, and not individuals, as there are certain specialties for the insolvency of the latest.

Under current Spanish insolvency law, a debtor shall apply for an insolvency proceeding, which are known as
“concurso de acreedores” when it is not able to meet its current obligations or when it expects that it will shortly be
unable to do so (unless the company has made a pre-insolvency filing in accordance Article5.bis that allows for a
3 month period to close a refinancing agreement with its creditors). The filing of such declaration of insolvency
may be requested by the debtor, any creditor thereof and certain interested third parties. If filed by the debtor, the
insolvency is deemed ‘‘voluntary’’ (concurso voluntario) and, if filed by a third party, the insolvency is deemed
‘‘mandatory’’ (concurso necesario). In the case of voluntary insolvency, as a general rule, the debtor still
maintains the management and full powers of disposal over its assets, although it is subject to the intervention
(intervención) of the insolvency administrator (administrador concursal) or administrators, as applicable. In the
case of mandatory insolvency, as a general rule, the debtor’s management powers are suspended, and
management’s former power, including the power to dispose of assets, is conferred solely upon the insolvency
administrators (sustitución). The time between the petition and the insolvency declaration by the court will depend
upon a number of factors, including whether the filing has been made by the debtor or the creditor (and, in turn,
whether the debtor has challenged the petition made by the creditor), whether all appropriate documentation has
been submitted on a timely basis or is incomplete, and the workload of the court.

Creditors may apply for a joint insolvency declaration of two or more of its debtors if either (i) there is a confusion
of assets among them, or (ii) they form part of the same group of companies. Therefore, the request for the joint
insolvency of two or more legal entities may only be filed by a common creditor of the relevant companies and
each of the affected companies must in fact be separately insolvent. Joint insolvency may also be requested by
the companies themselves, provided that they form part of the same group. Any of the insolvent debtors, or any of
the insolvency administrators, as the case may be, may apply for the accumulation of insolvency proceedings
already declared under certain circumstances (and, in particular, if the insolvent debtors form part of the same
group of companies). In addition, creditors may apply for the accumulation of the insolvency proceedings of two or
more of its debtors already declared if either (i) there is a confusion of assets among them, (ii) they form part of
the same group of companies, or (iii) they are managers, shareholders, partners or members personally liable for
the debts of the debtor if it is a legal entity, provided that a petition has not been submitted by any of the insolvent
debtors or by the insolvency administrators. Insolvency proceedings declared jointly or accumulated are
processed in coordination, without consolidation of the estate of the insolvent debtors. As a result, and as a
general rule, a ‘‘group insolvency’’ does not lead to a commingling of the debtors’ assets and creditors of such
group. This means that the creditors of one company of the group will not have recourse against other companies
of the same group (except where cross-guarantees exist). The current system is basically a procedural one,
aimed at making the insolvency proceedings as time and cost efficient as possible. However, exceptionally, and
for the purpose of the drafting of the insolvency report by the insolvency administrators only, assets and liabilities
amongst the companies declared insolvent may be consolidated where there is a confusion of states, and assets
and liabilities belonging to each of the companies cannot be identified.

The general principle of ‘‘no termination effect’’ is established such that all agreements remain effective at the
time of the insolvency. Therefore, the declaration of insolvency does not impair the existence of the contracts
entered into by the debtor, which would remain in force. Any contractual arrangements establishing the
termination of a contract and/or entitling the relevant creditor to terminate it in the event of the declaration of
insolvency of the debtor will be unenforceable.

There is a two-year clawback period starting backward from the date on which insolvency is declared, although
transactions within that period will not automatically become void as a result of the initiation of insolvency
proceedings but instead the insolvency administrators must expressly challenge those transactions. Also,
creditors who have applied to exercise any clawback action (stating the specific action they aim to contest or
revoke and their grounds), shall be entitled to exercise such action if the insolvency administrators do not do so
within the two months following their request. Under such clawback action, acts detrimental (perjudiciales) to the
debtor’s estate carried out during the two years prior to the date the insolvency is declared may be rescinded,
regardless of fraudulent intention (transactions taking place earlier than two years before insolvency has been
declared are subject to the general regime of avoidance in accordance with Article 71.7 of the Spanish insolvency
law). Acts where no consideration is received for a disposed asset and acts that result in the early repayment or
settlements of obligations which would have become due after the declaration of insolvency (unless such
obligations were secured by means of an in rem security) are considered detrimental, and this is a non-rebuttable
presumption. In addition, unless the debtor or another affected party (such as a creditor) can prove otherwise to
the court’s satisfaction, a disposal made in favor of a “related person or entity” (as detailed in the following


-----

paragraph) as well as the creation of a security interest securing a preexisting obligation or a new obligation that
replaces an existing one, and those payments or other acts extinguishing obligations that would have become
due after the declaration of insolvency and which are secured by means of an in rem security, are presumed to be
detrimental, and this is a non-rebuttable presumption. In the case of actions not covered by the presumptions
above, the burden of proof is on the person bringing the action of rescission. Acts deriving from the debtor’s
ordinary course of business made at arm’s length and certain refinancing arrangements (acuerdos de
_refinanciación) meeting certain legal requirements set forth in Article 71.6 of the Spanish Insolvency Law, as well_
as the business, acts and payments made in the ordinary course of business and the security created in
connection therewith, may not be rescinded.

In the case of a legal entity, the following shall be deemed to be ‘‘related person’’: (i) shareholders with unlimited
liability; (ii) limited liability shareholders holding 10% or more of the insolvent company’s share capital (or 5% if the
company is listed) by the time the credit right under dispute in the insolvency scenario arises; (iii) directors
(including shadow directors), liquidators and those holding general powers of attorney from the insolvent
company, as well as such individuals holding such positions within two years prior to the declaration of
insolvency; and (iv) companies pertaining to the same group as the debtor and their common shareholders
_provided such shareholders meet the minimum shareholding requirements set forth in (ii) above. In addition, it is_
established the rebuttable presumption that the assignees of the above are also ‘‘specially related persons’’ if the
assignment has occurred within two years prior to the declaration of insolvency.

In any event, set-off is prohibited unless the requirements for the set-off were satisfied prior to the declaration of
insolvency or the claim of the insolvent is governed by a law that permits set-off.

The current Spanish Insolvency Law makes a distinction between general debts under insolvency proceedings
and debts against the insolvency estate (créditos contra la masa). Debts against the insolvency estate, which
include, among others, (i) certain amounts of the employee payroll, (ii) costs and expenses of the insolvency
proceedings, (iii) certain amounts arising from services provided by the insolvent debtor under reciprocal
contracts and outstanding obligations that remain in force after insolvency proceedings are declared and deriving
from obligations to return and indemnify in cases of voluntary termination or breach by the insolvent debtor,
(iv) those that derive from the exercise of a clawback action within the insolvency proceedings of acts performed
by the insolvent debtor and correspond to a refund of consideration received by it (except in cases of bad faith),
(v) certain amounts arising from obligations created by law or from the non-contractual liability of the insolvent
debtor after the declaration of insolvency and until its conclusion, (vi) 50% of the funds lent under a refinancing
arrangement entered into in compliance with the requirements set forth in Article 71.6 of the Spanish insolvency
law and (vii) certain debts incurred by the debtor following the declaration of insolvency, are not considered part of
the debtor’s general debt and are payable when due according to their own terms (and, therefore, are paid before
other debts under insolvency proceedings).

The Spanish insolvency law procedure includes a common phase (during which, among others, insolvency
administrators are appointed, an inventory of the assets and a list of creditors is prepared and claims ranked, as
detailed below) and two potential results: (i) a composition agreement between the creditors and the debtor
(‘‘CVA’’) or (ii) the debtor’s liquidation.

Upon a filing for insolvency proceedings, the court issues an insolvency order containing an express request for
the creditors of the insolvent debtor to declare all debts owed to them by the debtor, providing original
documentation to justify such debts, within a period of one month. Based on the documentation provided by the
creditors and documentation held by the debtor, the court receivers draw up a list of acknowledged creditors and
classify them according to the categories established under law:

- Debts benefiting from special privileges (“créditos con privilegio especial”), representing security on certain
assets (in essence, in rem security). These privileges may entail separate proceedings, subject to certain
restrictions derived from a waiting period that may last up to one year. In general terms, privileged creditors are
not subject to the restructuring arrangement or to the CVA, except if they give their express support by voting
in favor of the restructuring arrangement. In the event of liquidation, they are the first to collect payment against
the assets on which their debt is secured.

However, the insolvency administrator has the option to halt any enforcement of the security and pay these
claims under specific payment rules. In addition, a recent court resolution considers that dissenting creditors
that (i) should be considered “privileged creditors” but (ii) who are not able to enforce their security on their own
(because, for instance, their right to enforce is subject to the agreement of a majority of lenders which take part
at a syndicated loan) cannot be considered “secured creditors” with regards to restructuring arrangement and
its effects. This means that secured creditors may not enforce on their own security interest and may not avoid


-----

the effects of the restructuring arrangement being imposed to them (and so cannot avoid being affected by the
deferral agreed therein).

- Debts benefiting from general privileges (“créditos con privilegio general”) including, among others, labor and
public debts. General privileges for public debt, other than debt relating to tax withholdings and certain social
security obligations, are recognized for half of the amount of the debt. General privileges are also recognized
for half of the amount of debt held by the first creditor to apply for the insolvency proceedings of the debtor.
Funds lent under a refinancing arrangement entered into in compliance with the requirements set forth in
Article 71.6 of the Spanish insolvency law in the amount not admitted as a debt against the insolvency estate
shall be also considered as debts with general privileges. Creditors whose debt benefits from general privileges
are not affected by CVA provided that they do not agree to it and, in the event of liquidation, they are the first to
collect payment, in the order established under law.

- Ordinary debts (non-subordinated and non-privileged creditors). Creditors of ordinary debt (“créditos
_ordinarios”) will be paid after creditors benefiting from special or general privileges on a pro rata basis vis à vis_
each other.

- Subordinated debts (classified as such by virtue of the underlying credit agreement or pursuant to law).
Subordinated debts (“créditos subordinados”) include, among others, debts communicated late (outside the
specific one-month period mentioned above), credits that are contractually subordinated vis-a`-vis all other
credits of the debtor; credits relating to surcharge and unpaid interest claims (including default interest) except
for those credits secured with an in rem right up to the secured amount; fines, debts held by ‘‘specially related
persons’’, as explained above, claims resulting from acts that were set aside where the creditor was declared
in the judgment to have acted in bad faith; and certain credits deriving from contracts with reciprocal obligations
if the creditor attempts to prevent the fulfillment of the contract to the detriment of the insolvency interests.
Subordinated creditors are not entitled to vote on the CVA and in practice usually have very limited chances of
collection, as a result of the ranking established by law.

**Applicable jurisdiction**

The applicable jurisdiction to conduct an insolvency proceeding is the one in which the insolvent party has its
‘‘centre of main interests” (“COMI”). This COMI is deemed to be where the insolvent party conducts the
administration of its interests on a regular basis and which may be recognized as such by third parties. Insolvency
proceedings conducted by the court of the COMI are considered ‘‘the principal insolvency proceedings’’ and have
universal reach affecting all the assets of the insolvent party worldwide. If the COMI is not in Spain, but the
insolvent party has a permanent establishment in Spain, Spanish courts will only have jurisdiction over the assets
located in Spain (the ‘‘territorial insolvency proceedings’’).

In the event that any of the Guarantors becomes insolvent and is subject to the current Spanish insolvency law,
its Guarantee will be treated as ordinary debt unless it is subordinated by application of any of the criteria
indicated above. In addition, creditors may seek repayment directly from the insolvent entity’s directors or
attorneys-in-fact if a court determines that the bankruptcy resulted from their negligence (concurso culpable), if
some legal requirements are met. Under the current Spanish insolvency law, the intercompany loans between the
Issuer and Empark would be treated as subordinated debt.

**Moratorium**

The current Spanish insolvency law imposes a moratorium on the enforcement of secured creditor’s rights (in rem
security) in the event of insolvency. The moratorium would take effect following the declaration of insolvency until
the earlier of (i) one year from the declaration of the insolvency if the insolvent company has not been placed in
liquidation or (ii) the date the creditors reach an agreement that does not affect the exercise of the rights granted
by the security interest, with the limitations explained above.

Additionally, once the insolvency proceedings are declared open, singular, judicial or extrajudicial enforcements
may not be initiated, nor may administrative or tax demands for payment to be collected coercively against the
assets of the debtor be continued.

As a general rule, insolvency proceedings are not compatible with other enforcement proceedings. When
compatible, in order to protect the interests of the debtor and creditors, the Spanish insolvency law extends the
jurisdiction of the court dealing with insolvency proceedings, which is then legally authorized to handle any
enforcement proceedings or interim measures affecting the debtor’s assets (whether based upon civil, labor or
administrative law).
**Limited history**


-----

Finally, please note that the current Spanish insolvency law only came into effect in September 2004, and as
such, there is only a limited history of its application by Spanish courts and with limited high court resolutions
about it.

**Limitation on validity and enforcement of Guarantees and Collateral granted by any Spanish Guarantor**

Under Spanish law, claims may become time-barred (15 years being the general term established for obligations
_in personam under Article 1,964 of the Spanish Civil Code (Código Civil)) or may be or become subject to the_
defense of set-off or counterclaim.

The terms ‘‘enforceable,’’ ‘‘enforceability,’’ ‘‘valid,’’ ‘‘legal,’’ ‘‘binding’’ and ‘‘effective’’ (or any combination thereof)
mean that all of the obligations assumed by the relevant party under the relevant documents are of a type
enforced by Spanish courts; the terms do not mean that these obligations will necessarily be enforced in all
circumstances in accordance with their terms. Enforcement before the courts will in any event be subject to:

- the nature of the remedies available in the courts; and

- the availability of defenses such as (without limitation) set-off (unless validly waived) or counter-claim,
circumvention of law (fraude de ley), abuse of rights (abuso de derecho), misrepresentation, force majeure,
unforeseen circumstances, undue influence, duress, and abatement

In general terms, under Spanish law, any guarantee, pledge or mortgage must guarantee or secure another
obligation to which it is ancillary, which must be clearly identified in the relevant guarantee or security agreement.
Therefore, the guarantee or security interest follows the underlying obligation in such a way that nullity of the
underlying obligation entails nullity of the guarantee or security and termination of the underlying obligation entails
termination of the guarantee or security. In the event that the security providers are able to prove that there are no
existing and valid guaranteed obligations, Spanish courts may consider that the security providers’ obligations
under the relevant guarantees or securities are not enforceable.

Following the amendment of paragraph 16 of section 1 article 90 of the Spanish Insolvency Law (Ley 22/2003 de
9 de julio) effective from January 1, 2012, although registering pledges over future credit rights (prenda de
_derechos de credito futuros) has become market practice in Spain, there is no assurance that such a structure will_
be effective before Spanish courts, in case of insolvency of the grantors, as there is no judicial or other guidance
as to its validity and enforceability, and therefore the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the security interest
relating to the credit rights under certain of the Spanish Guarantors’ off-street concessions and the security
interest over certain bank accounts of the Issuer and the Spanish Guarantors may be restricted.

The obligations under Guarantees or Collateral granted by the Spanish Guarantors shall not extend to any use of
the proceeds of the Notes for the purpose of acquiring shares representing the share capital of such Guarantor or
shares representing the share capital of the Parent Guarantor, or refinancing a previous debt incurred for the
acquisition of shares representing the share capital of such Guarantor or shares representing the share capital of
its Parent Guarantor; and shall be deemed not to be undertaken or incurred by the Guarantor to the extent that
the same would constitute unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of Article 150 of the Spanish
Companies Law, and, in that case, all provisions of such Guarantee shall be construed accordingly in the sense
that in no case can any Guarantee or security given by the Guarantor secure repayment of the above-mentioned
funds.

The security interests in the Collateral that will secure the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the
obligations of the Guarantors under the Note Guarantees will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes
but will be granted only in favor of the Security Agent, but it should be noted that the parallel debt concept is not
recognized in Spain. The Indenture will provide (along with the Intercreditor Agreement) that only the Security
Agent has the right to enforce the Security and Guarantee Documents. As a consequence, holders of the Notes
will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral
securing the Notes, except through the Trustee, who will (subject to the provisions of the Indenture and the
Intercreditor Agreement) provide instructions to the Security Agent in respect of the Collateral. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if enforcement of any security interest in Spain was to be carried out by the Security Agent in
Spain, it may be necessary to prove that the Security Agent is duly and expressly empowered for such purpose
by means of duly notarized powers of attorney granted in favor of the Security Agent by each of the actual or
future creditors, if necessary, with the Apostil of The Hague Convention dated October 5, 1961. Therefore, there
could be a delay in the enforcement of the Collateral in Spain while the Security Agent obtains such powers.

**Portuguese Insolvency Laws**

Under Portuguese insolvency law, your right to receive payments of interest and principal on the Notes in case of
insolvency may be more limited than would be the case under U.S. bankruptcy laws.

Portuguese insolvency law (approved by Decree-Law no. 53/2004, of March 18, and generally termed CIRE
(Código da Insolvência e da Recuperação de Empresas), as amended) governs court insolvency proceedings, as
opposed to out-of-court liquidation, which is only available when the debtor has sufficient assets to meet its
liabilities.

As a general rule insolvency proceedings governed by the CIRE are applicable to all persons and entities, subject
to certain exceptions, such as public entities, state-owned companies and insurance companies, credit
institutions, financial companies, investment companies, which render services related with the holding of funds or
securities on behalf of third parties, and collective investment schemes to the extent that the submission to the
insolvency proceeding would be contradictory/incompatible with the special legal frameworks of such entities.
These proceedings may lead either to the restructuring of the business (by the approval of an insolvency plan) or
to the liquidation of the assets of the debtor. A debtor may apply for insolvency proceedings when it finds himself
unable to meet its current obligations as they become due or when it expects that it will shortly be unable to do so.
In such cases, insolvency proceedings are available as a type of legal protection that the debtor may request in
order to avoid the attachment of its assets by its creditors. Where a debtor becomes insolvent, failing to meet its
current outstanding obligations on a regular basis, the debtor (or, in the case of a company, its directors) is under
a legal obligation to file for insolvency proceedings.

Please note that in the case of legal entities, the debtor is also considered to be in an insolvency situation when,
according to accounting criteria, the liabilities of the debtor clearly excess its assets (balance sheet test).

Upon a filing for insolvency proceedings, the court issues an insolvency declaration, and the creditors of the
insolvent debtor (including secured creditors) have to claim the acknowledgement of all debts owed to them by
the debtor, providing documentation to justify such debts, within a period of up to 30 days. Based on the
documentation provided by the creditors and documentation held by the debtor, the insolvency administrator
draws up a list of acknowledged creditors and classifies them according to the categories established under law:

a) _Secured credits: credits secured by in rem guarantees (garantias reais) including special statutory_
liens (privilégios creditórios especiais), e.g.:

        - Real estate special statutory liens (e.g.: state credits related with real estate property tax “IMI”)

        - Third parties credits (e.g. mortgage, income assignment, pledge)

        - Movable assets special statutory liens (e.g. credits resulting of justice expenses incurred in the
interest of the creditors)

b) _Privileged credits: credits secured by general statutory liens (privilégios creditórios gerais) over assets_
integrated in the insolvency estate up to the amount corresponding to the value of the assets granted
in guarantee or the general statutory liens, e.g.:

        - Labor, tax and social security debts;

        - Real estate general statutory liens.

c) _Common credits: all credits not included in any other category._

d) _Subordinated credits: (classified as such by virtue of the underlying credit agreement or pursuant to_
law). Subordinated credits include, among others, credits held by parties in special relationships with
the debtor, such as, in the case of an individual, credits held by his/her relatives; in the case of a legal
entity, credits held by the administrators, group companies and controlling shareholders or
shareholders in a group relationship. Certain subordinated creditors are not entitled to vote on the
restructuring arrangement and usually subordinated creditors have very limited chances of collection,
as a result of the ranking established by law.

The payment will be performed according to the credit ranking, being firstly paid the guaranteed credits, followed
by privileged credits (in the event of liquidation, they are the first to collect payment against the assets on which
their debt is secured or over which they have privileges in the order established by law), common credits and
finally subordinated credits. If the assets of the insolvency estate are insufficient to fully pay all creditors, the
payment to common creditors will be made by apportionment amongst all creditors and in proportion of their
credits. The payment of subordinated credits will only take place after full payment of common credits.


-----

All creditors may be subject to the restructuring arrangement. However, whilst guaranteed and privileged creditors
can dispute the restructuring arrangement by opposing the insolvency plan and claiming that they will be in a
worse position than if the restructuring plan was not approved, the remaining credits may only do so provided
certain requirements set forth by law are met.

Please note that payments described above are discounted for the payment of certain liquidation and insolvency
expenses.

Insolvency proceedings are not compatible with other enforcement proceedings filed, or to be file against the
debtor.

The CIRE provides that, upon the insolvency of a debtor, acts entered into or omitted within the two years prior to
the beginning of the insolvency proceeding may be cancelled in favor of the insolvency estate if they: (i) are
detrimental to the insolvency estate (i.e., actions that reduce, frustrate, obstruct, jeopardize or delay the payment
to the insolvency estate’s creditors), and (ii) have been carried out in bad faith;. The insolvency administrator has
six months to cancel these actions from the moment it becomes aware of them, but may, as a rule, never do so
after a two year period has elapsed from the declaration of insolvency. Bad faith for these purposes is the
acknowledgment, as of the date of the transaction in question, that (i) the debtor was insolvent, (ii) insolvency
proceedings had commenced against the debtor or (iii) the transaction in question would be detrimental to the
creditors of the debtor and such debtor was in an imminent insolvency situation. There is a refutable presumption
of “bad faith” if the transaction is effected in the two year prior to the commencement of insolvency proceedings
and is made with certain related parties.

As an exception to the above rules, article 121 of the CIRE identifies certain actions that are automatically (iuris et
_de iuri) considered as hindering the insolvency estate and that may be cancelled irrespective of bad faith. These_
actions include (i) payments or other forms of debt extinction made in the six month period prior to the
commencement of the insolvency procedure and carried out in unusual terms for standard market practice and
that the creditor could not demand; (ii) payments or other forms of debt extinction made before the relevant
credits had become due that occurred in the six month period prior to the commencement of the insolvency
procedure or after such commencement but before the credits had become due; (iii) granting in rem security
interests (garantias reais) to pre-existing credits or others that replace them in the six month period prior to the
commencement of the insolvency procedure; (iv) granting in rem security interests (garantias reais)
simultaneously with the secured obligation in the 60 day period prior to the commencement of the insolvency
procedure; (v) granting personal guarantees in the six month period prior to the commencement of the insolvency
procedure that do not relate to business transactions with a real interest to the debtor.

Under Portuguese law there is no legal concept of “parallel debt” and its use in the context of an insolvency
proceeding subject to the CIRE may lead to (i) the holders of the Notes not being ranked as guaranteed creditors
since they do not have direct secured claims, (ii) may not have the ability to directly enforce the security interest,
and (iii) a Portuguese insolvency court may not enforce the terms of intercreditor agreements, when allocating the
proceeds, as in such allocation they are bound to comply with the rules set forth by the CIRE.

**Luxembourg Insolvency Laws**

The Notes will be issued by the Issuer, which is a société anonyme incorporated under Luxembourg law, with its
registered office at 13-15 Avenue de la Liberté, L-1931 Luxembourg, Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and registered
with the Luxembourg Register of Commerce and Companies under number B 182.119. Under Luxembourg
insolvency laws, your ability to receive payments of interest and principal on the Notes may be more limited than
would be the case under U.S. or other bankruptcy laws. Under Luxembourg law, the following types of
proceedings (together referred to as insolvency proceedings) may be opened against a company incorporated in
Luxembourg having its center of main interests (within the meaning of the EU Insolvency Regulation) or an
establishment in Luxembourg (in the latter case assuming that the center of main interests is located in a
jurisdiction where the EU Insolvency Regulation is applicable):

- Bankruptcy proceedings (faillite), the opening of which may be requested by the Luxembourg company, by any
of its creditors or by the courts ex officio. Following such a request, the Luxembourg courts having jurisdiction
may open bankruptcy proceedings if the Luxembourg company (i) is in a state of cessation of payments
(cessation des paiements) and (ii) has lost its commercial creditworthiness (ébranlement du crédit). The main
effect of such proceedings is the sale of the assets and allocation of the proceeds of such sale between
creditors taking into account their rank of privilege, as well as the suspension of all measures of enforcement
against the company, except, subject to certain limited exceptions, for enforcement by secured creditors and
the payment of the secured creditors in accordance with their rank upon realization of the assets. In addition,


-----

the managers or directors of a Luxembourg company that ceases its payments (i.e. is unable to pay its debts
as they fall due with normal means of payment) must within a month of them having become aware of the
company’s cessation of payments, file a petition for bankruptcy (faillite) with the court clerk of the district court
of the company’s registered office. If the managers or directors fail to comply with such provision they may be
held (i) liable towards the company or any third parties on the basis of principles of managers’ / directors’
liability for any loss suffered and (ii) criminally liable for simple bankruptcy (banqueroute simple) in accordance
with article 574 of the Luxembourg commercial code.

- Controlled management proceedings (gestion contrôlée), the opening of which may only be requested by the
company and not by its creditors and under which a Luxembourg court may order the provisional stay of
enforcement of claims except for certain secured creditors (see the below applicable provisions of the
Collateral Act 2005); or

- Composition proceedings (concordat préventif de la faillite), which may be requested only by the company
(subject to obtaining prior consent of the majority of its creditors representing at least three-quarters of its
debts) and not by its creditors directly. The Luxembourg court’s decision to admit a company to the
composition proceedings triggers a provisional stay on enforcement of claims by creditors except for certain
secured creditors (see the below applicable provisions of the Collateral Act 2005).

- In addition to the proceedings described above, your ability to receive payment on the Notes may be affected
by a decision of a Luxembourg court to grant a stay on payments (sursis de paiements) or to put a
Luxembourg company into judicial liquidation (liquidation judiciaire). Judicial liquidation proceedings may be
opened at the request of the public prosecutor against companies pursuing an activity violating criminal laws,
or that are in serious breach or in violation of the Luxembourg commercial code or of the Luxembourg law
dated 10 August 1915 on commercial companies, as amended (the “Luxembourg Companies Law”). The
management of such liquidation proceedings will generally follow similar rules as those applicable to
Luxembourg bankruptcy proceedings.

The Issuer’s liabilities in respect of the Notes will, in the event of a liquidation of the Issuer following, in particular,
bankruptcy or judicial liquidation proceedings, only rank after the cost of liquidation (including any debt incurred
for the purpose of such liquidation) and any claims that are preferred under Luxembourg law. Preferential claims
under Luxembourg law include, among others:

- amounts owed to the Luxembourg Revenue;

- value added tax and other taxes and duties owed to the Luxembourg Customs and Excise;

- employees’ and employer’s social security contributions;

- landlord, pledgor not under the Collateral Act 2005; and

- remuneration owed to employees (last six months’ wages amounting to a maximum of six times the minimum
social salary).

Assets over which a security interest has been granted will, in principle, not be available for distribution to
unsecured and unpreferred creditors (except after enforcement and, only to the extent a surplus is realized).

Article 20(4) of the Collateral Act 2005 provides that, with the exception of the provisions of the Luxembourg law
of December 8, 2000 on over-indebtedness (which only apply to natural persons), the provisions of Book III, Title
XVII of the Luxembourg Civil Code, of Book 1, Title VIII and of Book III of the Luxembourg Commercial Code and
national or foreign provisions governing reorganization measures, winding-up proceedings or other similar
proceedings and attachments or other measures referred to in article 19(b) of the Collateral Act 2005 are not
applicable to financial collateral arrangements (such as Luxembourg law pledges over shares or bank accounts)
and shall not constitute an obstacle to the enforcement and to the performance by the parties of their obligations.
Certain preferred creditors of a Luxembourg company (see above) may have a privilege that ranks senior to the
rights of the secured or unsecured creditors.

Article 24 of the Collateral Act 2005 provides that foreign law security interests over claims or financial
instruments granted by a Luxembourg pledgor will be valid and enforceable as a matter of Luxembourg law
notwithstanding any Luxembourg insolvency proceedings, if such foreign law security interests are similar in
nature to a Luxembourg security interest falling within the scope of the Collateral Act 2005. If article 24 applies,
Luxembourg preference period rules are not applied (save the case of fraud).

Article 21(2) of the Collateral Act 2005 provides that where a financial collateral arrangement has been entered
into after the opening of liquidation proceedings or the coming into force of reorganization measures or the entry


-----

into force of such measures, such arrangement is enforceable against third parties, administrators, insolvency
receivers, liquidators and other similar persons if the collateral taker proves that it was unaware of the fact that
such proceedings had been opened or that such measures had been taken or that it could not reasonably be
aware of such proceedings, measures or arrangement.
**Impact of insolvency proceedings on transactions**

During such insolvency proceedings, all enforcement measures by unsecured creditors are suspended. Other
than as described above in respect of the provisions of the Collateral Act 2005, the ability of secured creditors to
enforce their security interests may also be limited, in particular in the event of controlled management
proceedings expressly providing that the rights of certain secured creditors are frozen until a final decision has
been taken by a Luxembourg court as to the petition for controlled management and may be affected thereafter
by any reorganization order given by the court. A reorganization order requires the prior approval by more than
50% of the creditors representing more than 50% of A Luxembourg company’s liabilities in order to take effect.

Furthermore, you should note that declarations of default and any subsequent acceleration (such as acceleration
upon the occurrence of an event of default) will not be enforceable during controlled management proceedings.
However, during such controlled management proceedings a notice of default may still be served.

Luxembourg insolvency laws may also affect transactions entered into or payments made by the Issuer during the
preference period (période suspecte)which is a maximum of six months plus ten days preceding the judgment
declaring bankruptcy, except that in certain specific situations the court may set the start of the suspect period at
an earlier date. In particular:

- pursuant to article 445 of the Luxembourg code of commerce (Code de Commerce), specified transactions
(such as, in particular, the granting of a security interest for antecedent debts save in respect of financial
collateral arrangements within the meaning of the Financial Collateral Law 2005; payment of debts which have
not fallen due, whether payment is made in cash or by way of assignment, sale, set-off or by any other means;
the payment of debts which have fallen due by any means other than in cash or by bill of exchange; the sale of
assets without consideration or with substantially inadequate consideration) entered into during the preference
period (or the ten days preceding it) must be set aside or declared null and void, if so requested by the
insolvency receiver;

- pursuant to article 446 of the Luxembourg code of commerce, payments made for matured debts as well as
other transactions (save financial collateral arrangements within the meaning of the Financial Collateral Law
2005) concluded for consideration during the preference period are subject to cancellation by the court upon
proceedings instituted by the insolvency receiver if they were concluded with the knowledge of the bankrupt
party’s cessation of payments; and

- pursuant to article 448 of the Luxembourg code of commerce and article 1167 of the Luxembourg civil code
(action paulienne), the insolvency receiver (acting on behalf of the creditors) has the right to challenge any
fraudulent payments and transactions, including the granting of security with an intent to defraud, made prior to
the bankruptcy, without any time limit.

In principle, a bankruptcy order rendered by a Luxembourg court does not result in the automatic termination of
contracts except for intuitu personae agreements (such as employment agreements and powers of attorney). The
contracts, therefore, subsist after the bankruptcy order. However, the bankruptcy receiver may choose to
terminate certain contracts so as to avoid worsening the financial situation of the company. As of the date of
adjudication of bankruptcy, no interest on any unsecured claim will accrue vis-à-vis the bankruptcy estate.
Insolvency proceedings may hence have a material adverse effect on Luxembourg company’s business and
assets and Luxembourg company’s respective obligations under the Notes.

Finally, international aspects of Luxembourg bankruptcy, controlled management or composition proceedings
may be subject to the EU Insolvency Regulation. In particular, rights in rem over assets located in another
jurisdiction where the EU Insolvency Regulation will not be affected by the opening of insolvency proceedings,
without prejudice however to the applicability of rules relating to the voidness, voidability or unenforceability of
legal acts detrimental to all the creditors (subject to the application of article 24 of the Collateral Law 2005 as
described above and article 13 of the EU Insolvency Regulation).

**Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests**

Under Luxembourg law, contracts are in principle formed by the mere agreement (consentement) between the
parties thereto. The granting of any financial collateral governed by the Collateral Act 2005 must be capable of


-----

being evidenced in writing. However, additional steps are required to enforce security interests against third
parties.

According to Luxembourg conflict of law rules, Luxembourg courts will generally apply, in relation to the creation,
perfection and enforcement of security interests over the assets subject to such security interests, the law of the
place where such assets subject are situated. As a consequence, Luxembourg law will apply in relation to the
creation, perfection and enforcement of security interests over assets located or deemed to be located in
Luxembourg, such as registered shares in Luxembourg companies, cash bank accounts held with a Luxembourg
bank, receivables/claims having debtors located in Luxembourg and/or governed by Luxembourg law, securities
which are held through an account located (or deemed to be located) in Luxembourg and bearer securities
physically held in Luxembourg.

If certain assets are located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg, the security interests over such assets will
be governed by Luxembourg law and must be created, perfected and enforced in accordance with Luxembourg
law. The creation, validity and enforcement of security interests such as pledges and transfer of ownership as
security, granted on financial instruments and claims (in order to secure cash settlement and/or delivery of
financial instruments) are notably governed by the Collateral Act 2005. Pursuant to the Collateral Act 2005, a
pledge (gage) is effected by a transfer of possession of the pledged assets to the pledgee or to a third party
acting as depository for the pledgee and the pledgee’s preference rights over the pledged assets only remain in
existence as long as the pledgee or the depository remains in possession of such assets.

A physical transfer of possession not being possible for intangibles such as monetary claims, the Collateral Act
2005 provides for a fictitious transfer of possession (i.e. perfection) which is effected by mechanisms which
depend on the nature of the intangibles involved. In case of registered shares, the dispossession is validly
realized by notifying the pledge to the issuer or by an acceptance of the pledge by the issuer who in turn will
proceed to an entry of the pledge in the share register held by the issuer.

For the purposes of its creation, validity and perfection, a pledge granted over cash bank account(s) must be
notified to and accepted by the relevant account bank. In addition, in order for such pledge to be first-ranking, the
account bank has to waive any pre-existing security interests and other rights in respect of the relevant cash
account. If any future cash bank accounts are also pledged, the perfection of the pledge over such future
accounts will require additional notification to, acceptance and waiver by the account bank. Until such notifications
and acceptances occur, the pledge is not perfected against the account bank and other third parties.

In case of receivables/claims, dispossession (and perfection of the pledge) is (as a matter of Luxembourg law)
effected as against the debtor of the pledged claims and any third parties by the entry into and the execution (by
all parties thereto) of the relevant pledge agreement. In addition, if the relevant debtor is a non-Luxembourg
entity, the perfection requirements necessary to be completed under or pursuant to the relevant governing law of
such debtor will also need to be accomplished in order for the pledge to be perfected. Nonetheless, the debtor of
a pledged claim may validly discharge its obligation by performance rendered to the pledgor as long as it has no
knowledge of the pledge (such knowledge to be acquired or deemed acquired, if the debtor has been notified of,
or has accepted, the granting and creation of the pledge over the pledged claims).
The above perfection steps and actions need to be undertaken by the grantor of the security interest and/or the
Security Agent. If the relevant pledgor or the Security Agent fail or are unable to take the necessary steps/actions
required to take or perfect any of the above-mentioned security interests, such security interests will not have
been created and/or perfected with respect to the claims arising under the Notes. Absent perfection, the Security
Agent may have difficulty enforcing its rights in the Collateral with regard to third parties, including a trustee in
bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in the same collateral. Finally, since the ranking of
pledges is determined by the date on which they became enforceable against third parties, a security interest
created on a later date over the same Collateral, but which come into force as against third parties earlier (by way
of accomplishment of the relevant perfection requirements) has priority.

Article 11 of the Collateral Act 2005 sets out the following enforcement methods, available upon the occurrence of
the relevant enforcement event in respect of a pledge governed by the provisions of the Collateral Act 2005:

- appropriation by the pledgee or appropriation by a third party of the pledged assets at (i) a value determined in
accordance with a valuation method agreed upon by the parties or (ii) the listing price of the pledged assets (if
the pledged assets are listed on an official Luxembourg or foreign stock market or traded on a recognized
regulated market open to the public);

- selling or causing the sale of the pledged assets (i) in a private transaction at commercially reasonable terms
(conditions commerciales normales), (ii) by a public sale at the stock exchange, or (iii) by way of a public
auction;


-----

- court allocation of the pledged assets to the pledgee in discharge of the secured obligations following a
valuation made by a court-appointed expert; or

- set-off between the secured obligations and the pledged assets.

As the Collateral Act 2005 does not provide any specific time periods and depending on (i) the method chosen,
(ii) the valuation of the pledged assets, (iii) any possible recourses, and (iv) the possible need to involve third
parties, such as, e.g., courts, stock exchanges and appraisers, the enforcement of the security interests might be
delayed.

Foreign law governed security interests and the powers of any receivers/administrators may not be enforceable in
respect of assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg. Security interests/arrangements, which are not
expressly recognized under Luxembourg law and the powers of any receivers/administrators may not be
recognized or enforced by the Luxembourg courts, in particular where the Luxembourg security grantor becomes
subject to Luxembourg insolvency proceedings or where the Luxembourg courts otherwise have jurisdiction
because of the actual or deemed location of the relevant rights or assets, except if “main insolvency proceedings”
(as defined in the EU Insolvency Regulation) are opened under Luxembourg law and such security
interests/arrangements constitute rights in rem over assets located in another Member State in which the EU
Insolvency Regulation applies, and in accordance of article 5 of the EU Insolvency Regulation.

The perfection of the security interests created pursuant to the pledge agreements does not prevent any third
party creditor from seeking attachment or execution against the assets, which are subject to the security interests
created under the pledge agreements, to satisfy their unpaid claims against the pledgor. Such creditor may seek
the forced sale of the assets of the pledgors through court proceedings, although the beneficiaries of the pledges
will in principle remain entitled in priority to the proceeds of such sale (subject to preferred rights by operation of
law).

When a Luxembourg company grants guarantees and/or security interests, applicable corporate procedures
normally entail that the decision be approved by a board resolution or by the decision of delegates that have been
appointed for such purpose. In addition, the granting of the envisaged guarantees and/or security interests must
comply with the Luxembourg company’s corporate object.
The proposed action by the company must be “in the corporate interest of the company”, which is a translation of
the French “intérêt social”, an equivalent term to the English legal concept of corporate benefit. The concept of
“corporate interest” is not defined by law, but has been developed by doctrine and court precedents and may be
described as being “the limit of acceptable corporate behavior”. Whereas the previous discussions regarding the
limits of corporate power are based on objective criteria (provisions of law and of the articles of association), the
concept of corporate benefit requires a subjective judgment. In a group context, the interest of the companies of
the group taken individually is not entirely eliminated.

With respect to guarantors and/or security grantors incorporated in Luxembourg, even if the Luxembourg
Companies Law, does not provide for rules governing the ability of a Luxembourg company to guarantee and/or
secure the indebtedness of another entity of the same group, it is generally held that within a group of companies,
in the context of a group of related companies, the existence of a group interest in granting upstream or crossstream assistance under any form (including under the form of guarantee or security) to other group companies
could constitute sufficient corporate benefit to enable a Luxembourg company to grant such guarantee or security,
provided that the following conditions are met (and subject in any event to all the factual circumstances of the
matter): (i) such guarantee or security must be given for the purpose of promoting a common economic, social
and financial interest determined in accordance with policies applicable to the entire group, (ii) the commitment to
grant such guarantee or security must not be without consideration and such commitment must not be manifestly
disproportionate in view of the obligations entered into by other group companies, and (iii) such guarantee or
security granted or any other financial commitments must not exceed the financial capabilities of the committing
company.

Although the existence of a corporate interest in the granting of a guarantee or a security interest on a group level
is certainly important, the mere existence of such a group interest does not compensate for a lack of corporate
interest for one or more of the companies of the group taken individually. The concept of corporate benefit is of
particular importance in the context of misuse of corporate assets provided by Article 171-1 of the Luxembourg
Companies Law.

The failure to comply with the corporate benefit requirement will typically result in liability (personal and/or
criminal) for the directors or managers of the guarantor concerned. The guarantees or security interests granted
by a Luxembourg company could themselves be held void or unenforceable if their granting is contrary to
Luxembourg public policy (ordre public). It should be stressed that, as is the case with all criminal offenses


-----

addressed by the Luxembourg Company Law, a director or a manager of a company will in general be prosecuted
for misuse of corporate assets only if someone has lodged a complaint with the public prosecutor. This person
may be an interested third party, e.g., a creditor, a minority shareholder, a liquidator or an insolvency receiver. In
addition, it cannot be excluded that the public prosecutor could act on its own initiative if the existence of such a
misuse of corporate assets became known to him. If there is a misuse of corporate assets criminally sanctioned
by court, then this could, under general principles of law, have the effect that contracts concluded in breach of
Article 171-1 of the Luxembourg Companies Law will be held null and void. The criteria mentioned above have to
be applied on a case-by-case basis, and a subjective, fact-based judgment is required to be made, by the
directors or managers of the Luxembourg company. As a result of the above developments, the guarantees or
security interests granted by a Luxembourg company will be subject to certain limitations, which will take the form
of general limitation language (limiting the guarantee obligations of such Luxembourg company to a certain
percentage of, inter alia, its net assets (capitaux propres) and certain intra-group liabilities), which is inserted in
the relevant finance document(s), indenture or guarantee agreements and which covers the aggregate obligations
and exposure of the relevant Luxembourg company under all finance documents, indenture or guarantee
agreements.

The registration of the Notes, the security interest agreements, the Indenture, the Note Guarantees and the
transaction documents (and any document in connection therewith) with the Administration de l’Enregistrement et
_des Domaines in Luxembourg may be required in the case of legal proceedings before Luxembourg courts or in_
the case that the notes, the security interest agreements, the indenture, the guarantees and the transaction
documents (and any document in connection therewith) must be produced before an official Luxembourg
authority (autorité constituée). In such case, either a nominal registration duty or an ad valorem duty (or, for
instance, 0.24% of the amount of the payment obligation mentioned in the document so registered) will be
payable depending on the nature of the document to be registered. No ad valorem duty is payable in respect of
security interest agreements, which are subject to the Collateral Law 2005.

The Luxembourg courts or the official Luxembourg authority may require (when these are presented before them)
that the notes, the security interest agreements, the indenture, the guarantees and the transaction documents
(and any document in connection therewith) and any judgment obtained in a foreign court be translated into
French or German.

# Tax Considerations

**European Tax Considerations**

Under EC Council Directive 2003/48/EC on the taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments (the
“Tax Directive”), each Member State is required to provide to the tax authorities of another Member State details
of payments of interest (or other similar income) made by a person within its jurisdiction to, or collected by such
person for, an individual resident or certain other types of entities (the “Residual Entities” within the meaning of
Article 4.2 of the Tax Directive) established in that other Member State. However, for a transitional period,
Luxembourg and Austria are instead required (unless during that period they elect otherwise) to operate a
withholding system in relation to such payments, deducting tax at the rate of 35%. In the case of Luxembourg, the
recipient of the interest payment may opt for one of the two information exchange procedures available instead of
the application of the above withholding system. The ending of such transitional period being dependent upon the
conclusion of certain other agreements relating to information exchange with certain other countries.

On 10 April 2013, Luxembourg officially announced that it will no longer apply the withholding tax system as from
1 January 2015 and will provide details of payment of interest (or similar income) as from this date.

A number of non-EU countries and territories including Switzerland and certain dependent or associated
territories of certain Member States have adopted or agreed to adopt similar measures (a withholding system in
the case of Switzerland). In addition, the Member States have entered into reciprocal provision of information or
transitional withholding arrangements with certain of those dependent or associated territories in relation to
payments made by a person in a Member State to, or collected by such a person for, an individual resident or a
Residual Entity established in one of those territories. A consultation process is currently underway within the EU
in relation to the scope of the Tax Directive and, in particular, whether the Tax Directive should also extend to
payments channeled through intermediate entities and/or to payments considered to be of an interest-like nature.
If any of the proposed changes are made in relation to the Tax Directive, they may amend or broaden the scope
of the requirements above.

If a payment were to be made or collected through a Member State which has opted for a withholding system and
an amount of, or in respect of, tax were to be withheld from that payment, neither the Issuer nor any paying agent
nor any other person would be obliged to pay additional amounts to the holders of the Notes or to otherwise
compensate holders of the Notes for the reduction in the amounts that they will receive as a result of the
imposition of such withholding tax. However, the Issuer is required to maintain a paying agent in a Member State
that will not be obliged to withhold or deduct for or on account of tax pursuant to the Tax Directive.

**Luxembourg Tax Considerations**

**A) Tax residency**

A holder of Notes will not become resident, or be deemed to be resident, in Luxembourg by reason only of the
holding of the Notes, or the execution, performance, delivery and/or enforcement of the Notes.

**B) Luxembourg withholding tax on the Notes**

Under Luxembourg tax law currently in effect and except for certain individual persons and entities as described
below, all payments of interest (including accrued but unpaid interest) and principal made by the Issuer in the
context of the holding, disposal, redemption or repurchase of the Notes, which are not profit sharing, can be made
free and clear of any withholding or deduction for or on account of any taxes of whatsoever nature imposed,
levied, withheld, or assessed by Luxembourg or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein, in
accordance with the applicable Luxembourg law.
**_(a) Luxembourg non-resident holders of Notes_**


-----

Under the Luxembourg law dated 21 June 2005 as amended implementing the Tax Directive and several
agreements concluded between Luxembourg and certain dependent and associated territories of the EU, a
Luxembourg-based paying agent (within the meaning of the Tax Directive) is required since 1 July, 2005 to
withhold tax on interest and other similar income paid by it to (or under certain circumstances, to the benefit of) an
individual or resident in another Member State or in certain EU dependent and associated territories, unless the
beneficiary of the interest payments elects for the exchange of information procedure or for the tax certificate
procedure. The same regime applies to payments to a residual entity established in another Member State or
certain EU dependent or associated territories with the meaning of Article 4.2 of the Tax Directive, i.e.:

(a) entities which are not legal persons (the Finnish and Swedish companies listed in Article 4.5 of the Tax
Directive are not considered as legal persons for this purpose),

(b) whose profits are not taxed under the general arrangements for the business taxation,

(c) that are not, or have not opted to be considered as a UCITS (Undertakings for Collective Investment in
Transferable Securities) recognized in accordance with the Council Directive 85/611/EEC (Council
Directive 2009/65/EC for the recast) resident or established in another Member State or in any of the
certain EU dependent or associated territories.

Where withholding tax is applied, it is currently levied at a rate of 35%. Responsibility for the withholding of the tax
will be assumed by the Luxembourg paying agent. Payments of interest under the Notes coming within the scope
of the Luxembourg laws dated June 21, 2005 would be subject to withholding tax of 35%. The withholding tax
system will only apply during a transitional period, the ending of which depends on the conclusion of certain
agreements relating to information exchange with certain third countries. However, please note that Luxembourg
government officially announced on April 10, 2013 that it will no longer apply the withholding tax system as from
January 1, 2015 and will provide details of payment of interest (or similar income).

**_(b) Luxembourg resident holders of Notes_**

Under the Luxembourg law of December 23, 2005, as amended, a 10% withholding tax (the “10% Tax”) has been
introduced on interest payments made by Luxembourg paying agents (defined in the same way as in the Tax
Directive) to (or for the benefit of) Luxembourg individual holder of Notes.

Pursuant to the law of December 23, 2005 as amended by the law of July 17, 2008, Luxembourg resident
individuals, acting in the course of their private wealth, can opt to self-declare and pay a 10% levy (the “10%
_Levy”) on interest payments made by paying agents (as defined in the Tax Directive) located in an Member State_
other than Luxembourg, a Member State of the European Economic Area other than an Member State, or in a
State or territory which has concluded an international agreement directly related to the Tax Directive.

The 10% Tax as described above or the 10% levy are final when Luxembourg resident individuals are acting the
context of the management of their private wealth.

Responsibility for the withholding of tax in application of the above mentioned Luxembourg law of December 23,
2005, as amended, is assumed by the Luxembourg paying agent within the meaning of these law and not by the
Issuer (unless the Issuer acts as a paying agent).

**C) Luxembourg taxation of the holders of Notes**

**_Taxation of Luxembourg non-residents_**

Holders of Notes who are non-residents of Luxembourg and who have neither a permanent establishment, nor a
permanent representative nor a fixed base of business in Luxembourg with which/whom the holding of the Notes
is connected are not liable to pay any Luxembourg income tax, whether they receive payments of principal,
payments of interest (including accrued but unpaid interest), payments received upon the redemption, repurchase
or exchange of the Notes, or realize capital gains on the sale of any Notes.

**_Taxation of Luxembourg residents_**

_General_

Luxembourg resident holders of Notes will not be liable to any Luxembourg income tax on repayment of principal.


-----

_Luxembourg resident individuals_

Luxembourg resident individuals holders of Notes, acting in the course of the management of their private wealth,
are subject to Luxembourg income tax at progressive rates in respect of interest received, redemption premiums
or issue discounts under the Notes, except if the 10% Tax has been levied by a Luxembourg paying agent on
such payments or, in case of a non-resident paying agent, if they have opted to self-declare and pay the 10%
Levy. The 10% Tax or the 10% Levy represent the final tax liability on interest received for Luxembourg resident
individual holders of Notes receiving the payment in the course of the management of their private wealth and can
be reduced in consideration of foreign withholding tax, based on double tax treaties concluded by Luxembourg.

Luxembourg resident individual holders of Notes receiving interest as business income must include interest
income in their taxable basis. If applicable, the 10% Tax levied will be credited against their final income tax
liability.

Luxembourg resident individual holders of Notes are not subject to taxation on capital gains upon the disposal of
the Notes owned in the framework of the management of their private wealth, unless (i) the disposal of the Notes
precedes the acquisition of the Notes, (ii) the Notes are disposed of within six months of their date of acquisition
and (iii) the Notes do not constitute zero coupon notes. Upon redemption/sale of the Notes, the portion of the
redemption/sales price corresponding to accrued but unpaid interest will be subject to the 10% Tax or to the 10%
Levy. The 10% Tax or the 10% Levy represent the final tax liability for Luxembourg resident individual holders of
Notes receiving the payment in the course of the management of their private wealth. Luxembourg resident
individual holders of Notes receiving the interest as business income must include the portion of the
redemption/sales price corresponding to this interest in their taxable income. The 10% Tax levied will be credited
against their final income tax liability.

_Luxembourg resident companies_

Luxembourg resident company (sociétés de capitaux) holders of Notes or foreign entities of the same type which
have a permanent establishment or a permanent representative in Luxembourg with which the holding of the
Notes is connected, must include in their taxable income any interest income (including accrued but unpaid
interest) and the difference between the sales price (including accrued but unpaid interest) and the lower of the
cost or book value of the Notes sold or converted.

_Luxembourg resident companies benefiting from a special tax regime_

Luxembourg resident company holders of Notes which are companies benefiting from a special tax regime, such
as, for example (i) family estate management companies subject to the Law of May 11, 2007, as amended,
(ii) specialized investment funds subject to the Law of February 13, 2007, as amended or (iii) undertakings for
collective investment subject to the Law of December 17, 2010, as amended, are neither subject to Luxembourg
income tax in respect of interest accrued or received, any redemption premium or issue discount, nor on gains
realized on the sale or disposal, in any form whatsoever, of the Notes.
**D) Luxembourg net wealth tax**

An individual holder of Notes, whether he/she is resident of Luxembourg or not, should not be subject to
Luxembourg wealth tax on such Notes.

Luxembourg net wealth tax will not be levied on a corporate holder of Notes, unless:

(i) such holder of Notes is, or is deemed to be a fully taxable Luxembourg resident company for the
purpose of the relevant provisions and is not a holder of Notes governed by (a) the law of
December 17, 2010, as amended, on undertakings for collective investment or (b) the law of March 22,
2004, as amended, on securitization, or (c) the law of June 15, 2004, as amended, on the investment
company in risk capital, or (d) the law of May 11, 2007, as amended, on family estate management
companies or (e) the law of July 13, 2005, as amended, on Luxembourg pension pooling vehicules or
(f) the law of February 13, 2007, as amended, on specialized investment funds; or

(ii) the Notes are attributable to an enterprise or part thereof which is carried on by a non-resident
company in Luxembourg through a permanent establishment, a permanent representative or a fixed
place of business.

**E) Other Luxembourg taxes**


-----

There is no Luxembourg registration tax, stamp duty or any other similar tax or duty payable in Luxembourg by
holders of Notes as a consequence of the issuance of the Notes, nor will any of these taxes be payable as a
consequence of a subsequent transfer, repurchase or redemption of the Notes.

However, registration duty may be due upon the registration of the Notes in Luxembourg in the case of legal
proceedings before Luxembourg courts or in case the Notes must be produced before an official Luxembourg
authority, or in the case of a registration of the Notes on a voluntary basis.

There is no Luxembourg value added tax payable in respect of payments in consideration for the issuance of the
Notes or in respect of the payment of interest or principal under the Notes of the transfer of the Notes.
Luxembourg value added tax may, however, be payable in respect of fees charged for certain services rendered
to the Issuer, if for Luxembourg value added tax purposes such services are rendered or are deemed to be
rendered in Luxembourg and an exemption from Luxembourg value added tax does not apply with respect to
such services.

No gift, estate or inheritance taxes are levied on the transfer of the Notes upon death of a holders of Notes in
cases where the deceased was not a resident of Luxembourg for inheritance tax purposes, or in the case of a gift,
the gift is neither recorded in a Luxembourg notarial deed nor registered in Luxembourg.

**Spanish Tax Considerations**

This section does not purport to deal with all aspects of Spanish taxation that relate to investment in the Notes or
that may be relevant to particular investors in light of their personal investment circumstances. If you are
considering buying Notes, you should consult your own tax advisor concerning the tax consequences of holding
the Notes in your particular situation.

By virtue of Royal Decree-Law 20/2011, tax rates mentioned in this section were increased in principle only for
2012 and 2013. Nevertheless, the draft national budget bill for 2014 (currently under discussion in the Spanish
Parliament) amends that rules, and establishes an extension of the increased tax rates for 2014.
**Tax treatment of income payments made under the Note Guarantees by the Parent Guarantor or other**
**Spanish Guarantors**

Although no clear precedent exists with regard to the position of the Spanish tax authorities regarding similar
transactions, there is a risk that the Spanish tax authorities or courts could consider that income payments made
under the Note Guarantees by the Parent Guarantor or other Spanish Guarantors the (“Spanish Guarantors”) are
Spanish source income on the basis that the Spanish Guarantors have assumed all the obligations of the Notes
as Guarantors. In the event that income payments made under the Note Guarantees by the Spanish Guarantors
were deemed to be Spanish source income, in the case of non-Spanish tax residents without a permanent
establishment in Spain, tax at a 21% rate would be applicable on the part of the payments that constitute income
for the beneficial owner subject to the exceptions referred to in the paragraph below. Spanish resident beneficial
owners, or Spanish permanent establishments of non-resident beneficial owners, shall be subject to taxation in
Spain following the general rules governing Spanish personal, corporate and non-resident income taxes.

However, in the case of beneficial owners of the Notes non-resident in Spain, any interest payments and capital
gains under the Note Guarantees will not be subject to Spanish withholding tax if they were resident, for tax
purposes, in a European Union Member State other than Spain provided that they were not acting through a
territory considered as a tax haven pursuant to Royal Decree 1080/1991 of 5 July 1991 nor through a permanent
establishment in Spain nor through a permanent establishment in a state that is not a member of the European
Union.

In addition, Spanish withholding tax under the Note Guarantee payments, if any, to non-resident beneficial owners
with no Spanish permanent establishment, may be reduced or eliminated pursuant to, and in accordance with,
any applicable double taxation treaty to which the Kingdom of Spain is a party and that may be applicable in
respect to any interest payment due or that becomes due under the Notes.

For these tax benefits to apply to non-residents without a Spanish permanent establishment, a certificate of tax
residency issued by the competent tax authority of the country of residency of the beneficial owner of the Notes
required by the Spanish tax authorities must be submitted to the Spanish Guarantors showing that the holders of
the Notes are residents of the relevant European Union Member State or treaty state. The certificate must be
dated not more than 12 months prior to the date of application. If a tax treaty benefit is applicable, the certificate
must expressly state that it is issued within the meaning of the corresponding tax treaty or, if any specific form has
been approved in order to apply the treaty, the certificate should be in compliance with such form.

**Tax treatment of individuals with tax residence in Spain**

**_Interest on the Notes and disposal of the Notes_**

Both interest periodically received and income derived from the transfer, redemption or reimbursement of the
Notes constitute a return on investment obtained from the transfer of a person’s own capital to third parties in
accordance with the provisions of Section 25 of the Personal Income Tax (“Impuesto sobre la Renta de las
_Personas Físicas” or “PIT”) Law (Law 35/2006, of November 28, 2006), and therefore will form part of the so-_
called savings income tax base pursuant to the provisions of the PIT Law and will be taxed at 21% rate on the first
€6,000, at 25% on the portion of the savings income between €6,000 and €24,000, and at 27% rate on any
amount exceeding €24,000 threshold.

In the event that such interest or the income derived from the transfer, redemption or reimbursement of the Notes
becomes subject to withholding tax in Luxembourg, as Luxembourg source income, individuals with tax residence
in Spain would be entitled to a tax credit for the avoidance of double taxation when determining their tax liability,
in accordance with the provisions of the PIT Law or the treaty for the avoidance of double taxation with respect to
taxes on income and capital and the prevention of fiscal evasion entered into between Spain and Luxembourg on
June 3, 1986, as amended by the Protocol dated November 10, 2009 (the “Spain/Luxembourg Tax Treaty”).

**_Spanish withholding tax on the Notes_**

Irrespective of the Issuer not being a Spanish tax resident entity, a withholding at a 21% rate is applicable on
interest payments made to individual Spanish holders in the event the Notes are deposited before or managed by
Spanish-resident entities or persons or by non-resident entities or persons operating in the Spanish territory
through a permanent establishment or if the above-mentioned persons or entities have been entrusted with the
collection of the income derived from the Notes, provided that such income has not been previously subject to
withholding tax in Spain. In addition, income obtained upon transfer or redemption of the Notes may also be
subject to PIT withholdings. In any event, individual Spanish holders may credit the withholding against their final
PIT liability for the relevant fiscal year.

**Corporations resident in Spain for tax purposes or permanent establishments in Spain of non-Spanish tax**
**residents**

**_Interest on the Notes_**

Under Spanish law, interest collected by a Spanish holder of the Notes is subject either to Corporate Income Tax
(“Impuesto sobre Sociedades” or “CIT”) or to Non-Residents’ Income Tax (“Impuesto sobre la Renta de no
_Residentes” or “NRIT”), as the case may be. In the event that such interest becomes subject to withholding tax in_
Luxembourg, as Luxembourg source income, Spanish tax resident corporations would be entitled to a tax credit
for the avoidance of double taxation when determining their tax liability, in accordance with the provisions of the
CIT Law (approved by Legislative Royal Decree 4/2004, of March 5, 2004) or the Spain/Luxembourg Tax Treaty.

In addition, in accordance with the NRIT Law (approved by Legislative Royal-Decree, of March 5, 2004),
permanent establishments in Spain of non-Spanish tax residents would also be eligible for a tax credit to avoid
double taxation with respect to any Luxembourg withholding tax on interest payments.

**_Disposal of the Notes_**

As a general rule, a disposal, whether in the form of a transfer, redemption or reimbursement, of the Notes by a
Spanish holder may give rise to a taxable income or an allowable loss for the purposes of either CIT or NRIT, as
the case may be. Some restrictions, however, may apply based on the nature of the permanent establishment.

The profit or loss arising from the disposal of the Notes for a Spanish holder (the quantification of which, as a
general rule, follows accounting rules) shall be subject to either the CIT or to the NRIT, as the case may be, at the
relevant applicable tax rates.

If for any reason a Spanish tax resident corporation is subject to tax in Luxembourg on the income it obtains upon
the disposal of the Notes, it will be entitled to a tax credit for the avoidance of double taxation in accordance with
the provisions of the CIT Law or the Spain/Luxembourg Tax Treaty. Moreover, permanent establishments in
Spain of non-Spanish tax residents are eligible for a tax credit under the NRIT Law to avoid double taxation with
respect to any such Luxembourg source income.

**_Spanish withholding tax on the Notes_**


-----

No withholding on account of Spanish CIT or NRIT is levied in Spain on any income arising from Notes held by a
Spanish holder that is a corporation or a permanent establishment in Spain of a non-Spanish tax resident if the
Notes are traded on an OECD country’s official stock market. However, the financial institution (if resident in
Spain or acting through a permanent establishment in Spain) acting as paying agent or intervening in any
transfer, redemption or refund of the Notes will be obliged to calculate the taxable income of the Spanish holder
arising from the relevant transaction and to report such income to the Spanish holder and to the Spanish tax
authorities. In addition, the financial institution must provide the Spanish tax authorities with information regarding
the persons participating in the transaction.

If the Notes are not traded on an OECD country’s official stock market and the Notes are deposited with or
managed by a financial institution resident in Spain, or acting through a permanent establishment in Spain, in
accordance with the Spanish tax laws in force, the financial institution, acting as depositary or manager of such
Notes, will be responsible for making the relevant Spanish withholding on account of tax on any payment to a
Spanish holder deriving from the Notes. It should be noted that the financial institution acting as custodian or
manager of the Notes may become obliged to comply with the formalities contained in the Spanish CIT
Regulations when intervening in the repayment and/or transfer of the Notes.

**Beneficial owners not residents in Spain without a permanent establishment**

If interest is received by the beneficial owners of the Notes when they were not resident for tax purposes in Spain
and do not obtain the income through a permanent establishment located in Spain, the first issue to be
determined is whether or not such interest could be considered as Spanish-source income. The Spanish NonResident Income Tax legislation establishes that interest that is deemed remuneration relating to capital used
within the Spanish territory is regarded as Spanish-source income and subject to taxation in Spain. Although there
is no clear guidance from tax administrative or judicial authorities regarding this concept, the Spanish tax
authorities could consider that, due to the fact that the capital received by the Issuer is used to enter into loans
with a company resident for tax purposes in Spain, interest received by the beneficial owners is related to capital
used within the Spanish territory by the Issuer, at least for the portion corresponding to the financing of activities
in Spain. Therefore, there is a risk that interest under the Notes could be taxed at a 21% tax rate for such
persons, subject to available relief under a treaty for the avoidance of double taxation with Spain or any
exemption foreseen in the Spanish Non-Resident Income Tax legislation, if applicable, and provided that
corresponding formal requirements are met.

If withholding tax is imposed by the authorities on this basis, if the beneficial owners of the Notes were resident for
tax purposes:

(i) in a Member State of the European Union (and prove it by delivering a valid tax residence certificate),
interest would be exempt from Spanish NRIT.

(ii) in a country having in force a treaty for the avoidance of double taxation with Spain, if such treaty is
applicable for the beneficial owner of the Notes and the corresponding tax residence certificate (issued
within the meaning of the treaty and taking into account the corresponding required form) is duly
provided, interest could be taxed at the relevant rate (if any) foreseen by the applicable treaty.

In any other country, interest would be taxed at the relevant NRIT rate (currently, 21%).

**Portuguese Tax Considerations**

The information below provides a general description of the tax rules applicable to the acquisition, ownership and
subsequent transfer of the Notes under Portuguese tax law in force as of the date of this offering memorandum,
and does not take into account any developments or amendments thereof after that date whether or not such
developments or amendments have retroactive effect. This section does not intend to deal with all aspects of
Portuguese taxation
that relate to investment in the Notes or that may be relevant to particular investors in light of their personal
investment circumstances. Prospective purchasers of the Notes are advised to consult their own tax advisors as
to the tax consequences of holding the Notes.
**Tax treatment of individuals with tax residence in Portugal**

**_Interest on the Notes and disposal of the Notes_**

Interest and other investment income obtained by Portuguese resident individuals or by a non-Portuguese
resident individual having a permanent establishment in the Portuguese territory to which income is imputable on
the Notes is subject to Personal Income Tax. If the interest income is paid or made available through a


-----

Portuguese resident entity or a Portuguese branch of a non-resident entity (Portuguese paying agent), such
payments will be subject to final withholding taxation at a flat rate of 28%. When subject to final withholding tax
the income does not need to be included in the yearly tax return.

The individual may nonetheless opt for the aggregation of such income with the remaining taxable income, which
is subject to tax at progressive rates up to 48% (additional solidarity income tax herein excluded but due as
detailed below), plus an extraordinary surtax levied at a 3.5% rate over the annual income exceeding the annual
amount of the minimum national wage (€6,790). Additional solidarity income tax will be due on the part of the
taxable income exceeding €80,000 as follows: (i) 2.5% on the part of the taxable income exceeding €80,000 up to
€250,000 and (ii) 5% on the remaining part (if any) of the taxable income exceeding €250,000. In this case, the
tax already withheld is considered as payment on account of the final tax due.

If interest is not derived through a Portuguese paying agent, the income is not subject to withholding taxation in
Portugal at the time of the payment but the taxpayer is required to include the income in the yearly tax return and
apply an autonomous flat rate of 28%, unless an option for aggregation is made (in which case taxation is due
under the rules of the previous paragraph).

Resident beneficiaries are entitled under certain circumstances to claim an appropriate credit for any foreign
withholding tax against their personal income tax liability.

Non-habitual resident individuals in Portugal may be exempt from investment income arising from the Notes
issued by non-resident entities, under certain circumstances.

The disposal of the Notes by a Portuguese resident individual may generate capital gains taxed at a flat rate of
28% levied on the positive difference between the capital gains and capital losses realized each year on the
transfer of securities and derivatives (plus the 3.5% extraordinary surtax), unless the individual elects to include
such income in his taxable income, in which case it will be subject to tax at progressive income tax rates of up to
48% per cent plus an extraordinary surtax levied at a 3.5% rate over the annual income exceeding the annual
amount of the minimum national wage (€6,790). An additional solidarity income tax will be due on the part of the
taxable income exceeding €80,000 as follows: (i) 2.5% on the part of the taxable income exceeding €80,000 up to
€250,000 and (ii) 5% on the remaining part (if any) of the taxable income exceeding €250,000.

The computation of the annual balance of gains and losses for income tax purposes does not include losses
arising from transactions entered into with counterparts resident in a country, territory or region subject to a more
favorable tax regime, listed in Ministerial Order 150/2004 of 13 February (as amended by Ministerial Order
292/2011 of November 8, 2011).

No stamp tax applies to the acquisition through gift or inheritance of Notes by an individual. There is no wealth or
estate tax in Portugal. The Budget Bill for 2014 has been approved by the Parliament but does not establish any
tax rate increase for individuals in 2014.

**Corporations resident in Portugal for tax purposes or permanent establishments in Portugal of non-**
**Portuguese tax residents**

**_Interest on the Notes and disposal of the Notes_**

Interest income and capital gains derived from the disposal of the Notes by legal persons resident for tax
purposes in Portugal or attributable to a permanent establishment in Portugal of a non-resident entity are included
in their taxable base and subject to corporate tax at a rate of 25%. An additional municipal surtax (derrama
_municipal) of up to 1.5% of the taxable profit may apply. A state surtax (derrama estadual) of 3% on the portion of_
taxable profits which exceeds €1,500,000 and of 5% on the portion of taxable profits which exceeds €7,500,000 is
also applicable.

A CIT exemption may apply to specific entities (such as pension funds, retirement and/or education savings
funds, share savings funds and venture capital funds constituted under the laws of Portugal).

Non-exempt resident beneficiaries are entitled to claim an appropriate credit for any foreign withholding tax
against their final corporate income tax liability.

The acquisition of Notes through gift by a Portuguese resident legal person or attributable to a Portuguese
permanent establishment of a non-resident entity is also subject to corporate tax at a rate of 25%. The surtaxes
mentioned above may also apply.


-----

The Draft law for CIT Reform, currently under discussion in the Portuguese Parliament, may introduce relevant
amendments to the Portuguese corporate taxation. These amendments may include a lowering to 23% of the CIT
standard rate in financial year 2014. It is expected that such amendments will apply as from January 1, 2014.

**Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations**

TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH TREASURY DEPARTMENT CIRCULAR 230, HOLDERS ARE HEREBY
NOTIFIED THAT: (A) ANY DISCUSSION OF U.S. FEDERAL TAX ISSUES IN THIS OFFERING MEMORANDUM
IS NOT INTENDED OR WRITTEN TO BE RELIED UPON, AND CANNOT BE RELIED UPON, BY HOLDERS
FOR THE PURPOSE OF AVOIDING PENALTIES THAT MAY BE IMPOSED ON HOLDERS UNDER THE
INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1986, AS AMENDED; (B) SUCH DISCUSSION IS INCLUDED HEREIN BY
THE ISSUER IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROMOTION OR MARKETING (WITHIN THE MEANING OF
CIRCULAR 230) BY THE ISSUER OF THE TRANSACTIONS OR MATTERS ADDRESSED HEREIN; AND
(C) HOLDERS SHOULD SEEK ADVICE BASED ON THEIR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES FROM AN
INDEPENDENT TAX ADVISER.
# *****

The following is a summary of material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership and
disposition of Notes by a U.S. Holder (as defined below). This summary deals only with initial purchasers of Notes
at the “issue price” (as defined below) that are U.S. Holders and that will hold the Notes as capital assets. The
summary does not cover all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to, or the actual tax
effect that any of the matters described herein will have on, the acquisition, ownership or disposition of Notes by
particular investors, and does not address any tax consequences arising under U.S. federal estate and gift tax
laws or under the laws of any state, local, non-U.S. or other taxing jurisdiction. This summary also does not
discuss all the tax considerations that may be relevant to certain types of investors subject to special treatment
under the U.S. federal income tax laws (such as financial institutions, insurance companies, investors liable for
the alternative minimum tax, individual retirement accounts and other tax-deferred accounts, tax-exempt
organizations, dealers in securities or currencies, traders that elect to mark to market, real estate investment
trusts, regulated investment companies, grantor trusts, investors that will hold the Notes as part of straddles,
hedging transactions or conversion transactions for U.S. federal income tax purposes or investors whose
functional currency is not the U.S. dollar).

As used herein, the term “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of Notes that is, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, (i) an individual citizen or resident of the U.S., (ii) a corporation (or any other entity treated as a
corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized under the laws of the U.S., any State
thereof or the District of Columbia, (iii) an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax without
regard to its source or (iv) a trust if a court within the U.S. is able to exercise primary supervision over the
administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of
the trust, or the trust has elected to be treated as a domestic trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

The U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in a partnership (or other entity treated as a partnership for
U.S. federal income tax purposes) that holds Notes will depend on the status of the partner and the activities of
the partnership. Prospective purchasers that are partnerships (or other entities treated as partnerships for U.S.
federal income tax purposes) should consult their tax advisers concerning the U.S. federal income tax
consequences to their partners of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of Notes by the partnership.

The summary is based on the tax laws of the U.S., including the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the “Code”), its legislative history, existing and proposed regulations thereunder, published rulings and court
decisions, all as of the date hereof and all subject to change at any time, possibly with retroactive effect.

**THE SUMMARY OF U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES SET OUT BELOW IS FOR GENERAL**
**INFORMATION ONLY. ALL PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISERS AS**
**TO THE PARTICULAR TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF OWNING THE NOTES, INCLUDING THE**
**APPLICABILITY AND EFFECT OF STATE, LOCAL, FOREIGN AND OTHER TAX LAWS AND POSSIBLE**
**CHANGES IN TAX LAW.**

**Payments of interest**

**_General_**


-----

“Qualified stated interest” paid by the Issuer on the Notes (including any amounts withheld and any Additional
Amounts paid in respect of withholding taxes imposed on payments on the Notes) will generally be taxable to a
U.S. Holder as ordinary income at the time it is received or accrued, depending on the U.S. Holder’s method of
accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The term ‘‘qualified stated interest’’ generally means stated
interest that is unconditionally payable in cash or in property, other than debt instruments of the Issuer, at least
annually at a qualifying rate during the entire term of the Note. The Issuer expects that stated interest on the
Notes will be treated as qualified stated interest.

Interest on a Note (including any Additional Amounts) generally will be considered income from sources outside
the U.S. and, for purposes of the U.S. foreign tax credit, generally will be considered passive category income. A
U.S. Holder will generally be denied a foreign tax credit for foreign taxes imposed with respect to the Notes where
such holder does not meet a minimum holding period requirement during which such holder is not protected from
risk of loss. Prospective purchasers should consult their tax advisers concerning the applicability of the U.S.
foreign tax credit and source of income rules to income attributable to the Notes.

**_Foreign currency denominated interest_**

The amount of income recognized by a cash basis U.S. Holder will be the U.S. dollar value of the interest
payment, based on the “spot rate” (as such term is defined in the U.S. Treasury Regulations) on the date of
receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars.

An accrual basis U.S. Holder may determine the amount of income recognized with respect to an interest
payment denominated in Euro in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, the amount of
income accrued will be based on the average spot rate in effect during the interest accrual period (or, in the case
of an accrual period that spans two taxable years of a U.S. Holder, the part of the period within the taxable year).

Under the second method, the accrual basis U.S. Holder may elect to determine the amount of income accrued
on the basis of the spot rate in effect on the last day of the accrual period (or, in the case of an accrual period that
spans two taxable years, the spot rate in effect on the last day of the part of the period within the taxable year).
Additionally, if a payment of interest is actually received within five business days of the last day of the accrual
period, an electing accrual basis U.S. Holder may instead translate the accrued interest into U.S. dollars at the
exchange rate in effect on the day of actual receipt. Any such election will apply to all debt instruments held by the
U.S. Holder at the beginning of the first taxable year to which the election applies or thereafter acquired by the
U.S. Holder, and will be irrevocable without the consent of the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”).

Upon receipt of the interest payment (including a payment attributable to accrued but unpaid interest upon the
sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note) denominated in Euros, the accrual basis
U.S. Holder will generally recognize U.S. source exchange gain or loss (taxable as ordinary income or loss) equal
to the difference, if any, between the amount received (translated into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the date of
receipt) and the amount of such interest payment previously accrued, regardless of whether the payment is in fact
converted into U.S. dollars.

**_Effect of Spanish non-resident income tax_**

As discussed in “Tax Considerations—Spanish Tax Considerations”, under current law payments of interest on
the Notes to holders not resident in Spain without a permanent establishment may become subject to Spanish
Non-Resident Income Tax. The Issuer or the relevant Guarantor would be required to pay Additional Amounts to
U.S. Holders (see “Description of the Notes—Additional Amounts”) so that U.S. Holders receive the same
amounts they would have received had no Spanish Non-Resident Income Tax been imposed. If tax is withheld as
a result of the Spanish Non-Resident Income Tax, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, U.S. Holders would be
treated as having received the amount of Spanish taxes withheld by the Issuer with respect to a Note (or by the
relevant Guarantor with respect to a Note Guarantee), and as then having paid over the withheld taxes to the
Spanish taxing authorities. As a result of this rule, the amount of interest income included in gross income for U.S.
federal income tax purposes by a U.S. Holder with respect to a payment of interest may be greater than the
amount of cash actually received (or receivable) by the U.S. Holder from the Issuer or the Guarantors with respect
to the payment.

**Disposition of the Notes**

A U.S. Holder will generally recognize gain or loss on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition
of a Note equal to the difference between the amount realized on the disposition (less an amount equal to any
accrued but unpaid qualified stated interest, which will be taxable as interest income to the extent not previously


-----

included in income) and the U.S. Holder’s tax basis of the Note. A U.S. Holder’s tax basis in a Note will generally
be its U.S. dollar cost (as defined below), decreased by any cash payments on the Note other than qualified
stated interest. The U.S. dollar cost of a Note purchased with Euro will generally be the U.S. dollar value of the
purchase price on the date of purchase, or the settlement date for the purchase, in the case of Notes traded on an
established securities market, within the meaning of the applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations, that are purchased
by a cash basis U.S. Holder (or an accrual basis U.S. Holder that so elects). The amount realized on a sale,
exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition for an amount in Euros will be the U.S. dollar value of this
amount on the date of the disposition, or the settlement date of the disposition, in the case of Notes traded on an
established securities market, within the meaning of the applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations, sold by a cash
basis U.S. Holder (or an accrual basis U.S. Holder that so elects). The election available to accrual basis
U.S. Holders in regards to the purchase and sale of Notes traded on an established securities market must be
applied consistently to all debt instruments from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the
IRS.

A U.S. Holder will recognize U.S. source exchange rate gain or loss (taxable as ordinary income or loss) on the
sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note equal to the difference, if any, between the
U.S. dollar values of the U.S. Holder’s purchase price for the Note (or, if less, the principal amount of the Note)
(i) on the date of disposition and (ii) the date on which the U.S. Holder acquired the Note. Any such exchange rate
gain or loss (including any exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of accrued but unpaid interest) will be
realized only to the extent of total gain or loss realized on the sale or retirement. Except to the extent attributable
to changes in exchange rates, gain or loss recognized by a U.S. Holder on the sale, exchange, retirement or other
taxable disposition of a Note will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the Note was
held by the U.S. Holder for more than one year. Long-term capital gains recognized by an individual U.S. Holder
generally are subject to tax at a lower rate than short-term capital gains or ordinary income. The deductibility of
capital losses is subject to significant limitations.

Gain or loss realized by a U.S. Holder on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note
generally will be U.S. source. Prospective purchasers should consult their tax advisers as to the foreign tax credit
implications of the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of Notes.

**Disposition of euros**

Euros received as interest on a Note or on the sale, exchange, retirement or taxable disposition of a Note will
have a tax basis equal to its U.S. dollar value at the time they are received. Foreign currency that is purchased
will generally have a tax basis equal to the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency on the date of purchase. Any
gain or loss recognized on a sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a foreign currency
(including its use to purchase Notes or upon exchange for U.S. dollars) will be U.S. source ordinary income or
loss.

**Backup withholding and information reporting**

Payments of principal and interest on, and the proceeds of sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition
of Notes by a U.S. paying agent or other U.S. intermediary will be reported to the IRS and to the U.S. Holder as
may be required under applicable regulations. Backup withholding may apply to these payments if the U.S. Holder
fails to provide an accurate taxpayer identification number or certification of exempt status or fails to report all
interest and dividends required to be shown on its U.S. federal income tax returns. Certain U.S. Holders are not
subject to backup withholding.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be
allowed as a refund or a credit against a U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability provided the required
information is timely furnished to the IRS. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisers regarding backup
withholding and information reporting requirements relating to their ownership of the Notes.

**Reportable transactions**

A U.S. taxpayer that participates in a “reportable transaction” will be required to disclose its participation to the
IRS. Under the relevant rule a U.S. Holder may be required to treat a foreign currency exchange loss from the
Notes as a reportable transaction if this loss equals or exceeds the relevant threshold in the regulations
(US$50,000 in a single taxable year, if the U.S. Holder is an individual or trust, or higher amounts for other nonindividual U.S. Holders), and to disclose its investment by filing IRS Form 8886. A penalty in the amount of
US$10,000 in the case of a natural person and US$50,000 in all other cases is generally imposed on any
taxpayer that fails to timely file an information return with the IRS with respect to a transaction resulting in a loss


-----

that is treated as a reportable transaction. Prospective purchasers are urged to consult their tax advisers
regarding the application of these rules.
**Foreign financial asset reporting**

Recently enacted legislation imposes new reporting requirements on certain holders of “specified foreign financial
assets,” including securities of foreign entities, if the aggregate value of all such assets held by a taxpayer
exceeds US$50,000. The Notes are expected to constitute specified foreign financial assets subject to these
requirements unless an exception applies (including an exception for Notes held in accounts maintained by
certain financial institutions). U.S. Holders may be subject to this information reporting regime and required to file
IRS Form 8938 listing these assets with their U.S. federal income tax return. Failure to file information reports
may subject a U.S. Holder to penalties. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their own tax advisers regarding their
obligations to file information reports with respect to the Notes.

# Certain ERISA Considerations

The following is a summary of certain considerations associated with the purchase of the Notes by employee
benefit plans that are subject to Title I of the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended
(“ERISA”), plans, individual retirement accounts and other arrangements that are subject to Section 4975 of the
u.s. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) or provisions under any other Federal, state, local,
non-U.S. or other laws or regulations that are similar to such provisions of ERISA or the Code (collectively,
“Similar Laws”), and entities whose underlying assets are considered to include “plan assets” of such plans,
accounts and arrangements pursuant to the U.S. Department of Labor “plan assets” regulation, 29 CFR
Section 2510.3-101, as amended by Section 3(42) of ERISA (each, a “Plan”).

**General Fiduciary Matters**

ERISA and the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of a Plan subject to Title I of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code (an “ERISA Plan”) and prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an ERISA
Plan and its fiduciaries or other interested parties. Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any
discretionary authority or control over the administration of such an ERISA Plan or the management or disposition
of the assets of such an ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation to such
an ERISA Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan.

In considering an investment in the Notes of a portion of the assets of any Plan, a fiduciary should determine
whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the
applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law relating to the fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including,
without limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of
ERISA, the Code and any other applicable Similar Laws.

**Prohibited Transaction Laws**

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit ERISA Plans from engaging in specified
transactions involving plan assets with persons or entities who are “parties in interest”, within the meaning of
Section 3(14) of ERISA, or “disqualified persons”, within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless an
exemption is available. A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a non-exempt prohibited
transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. In
addition, the fiduciary of the ERISA Plan that engaged in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be
subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and/or the Code.

The acquisition and/or holding of the Notes by a Plan with respect to which the Issuer is a party in interest or a
disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of
ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an
applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. In this regard, the U.S. Department of
Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions (“PTCEs”) that may apply to the acquisition and holding
of the Notes. These class exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 respecting transactions determined
by independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1 respecting insurance company pooled
separate accounts, PTCE 91-38 respecting bank collective investment funds, PTCE 95-60 respecting life
insurance company general accounts and PTCE 96-23 respecting transactions determined by in-house asset
managers. There can be no assurance that any class exemption or any other exemption will be available with
respect to any particular transaction involving the Notes, or that if an exemption is available, it will cover all
aspects of any particular transaction.
**Representation**

Accordingly, by acceptance of a Note or any interest therein, each purchaser and holder will be deemed to have
represented and warranted that either (i) it is not acquiring or holding the Note with the assets of a Plan, or (ii) the
acquisition and holding of the Notes will not result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of
ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a similar violation under any applicable Similar Laws.

The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all-inclusive. Due to the complexity of
these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions,
it is particularly important that fiduciaries, or other persons considering purchasing the Notes on behalf of, or with
the assets of, any Plan, consult with their counsel regarding the potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of


-----

the Code and any Similar Laws to such investment and whether an exemption would be applicable to the
purchase and holding of the Notes.

# Plan of Distribution

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in a purchase agreement (the ‘‘Purchase Agreement’’) dated
December 11, 2013, the Issuer has agreed to sell to each Initial Purchaser, and each Initial Purchaser has
agreed, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Issuer the Notes. The Purchase Agreement provides that
the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of the Notes are subject to, among other
customary closing conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by counsel.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of
the Notes are subject to, among other customary closing conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by
counsel. The Issuer has agreed to pay the Initial Purchasers certain customary fees for their services in
connection with the Offering and to reimburse them for certain out-of-pocket expenses.

The Fixed Rate Notes and the Floating Rate Notes will initially be offered at the respective price indicated on the
cover page of this offering memorandum. After the initial offering, the offering price and other selling terms of the
Fixed Rate Notes and the Floating Rate Notes may from time to time be varied by the Initial Purchasers without
notice. One or more of the Initial Purchasers may sell through affiliates or other appropriately licensed entities for
sales for the Notes in jurisdictions where they are otherwise not permitted.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the Issuer and each Guarantor will indemnify the Initial Purchasers
against certain liabilities, including certain liabilities under the U.S. Securities Act, and will contribute to payments
that the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof.

During a period of 90 days from the date of the this offering memorandum, no company of the Group will offer for
sale, sell, contract to sell, grant an option for the sale of, or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly (except
through the Initial Purchasers or with the prior written consent of the Initial Purchasers), any other debt securities
or preferred equity securities issued or guaranteed by any company of the Group (other than the Notes) or
securities of any company of the Group that are convertible into, or exchangeable with, the Notes or such other
debt securities or preferred equity securities.

The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act. The Initial Purchasers have
agreed that they will only offer or sell the Notes (a) in the U.S. to persons reasonably believed to be qualified
institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act, and (b) outside the U.S. in offshore
transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act. Terms used above have the meanings
given to them by Rule 144A and Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act.

Until 40 days after the date the Notes are originally issued, an offer or sale of such Notes within the U.S. by a
dealer that is not participating in the Offering may violate the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act.

Each Initial Purchaser has represented that it (i) has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will
only communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity,
within the meaning of section 21 of FSMA, received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any notes in
circumstances in which section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer and (ii) has complied and will
comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything done by it in relation to the Notes in,
from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.
The Notes will constitute a new class of securities with no established trading market. Application will be made for
the Notes to be listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on the Euro
MTF market thereof. However, there can be no assurance that the prices at which the Notes will sell in the market
after the Offering will not be lower than the initial offering price or that an active trading market for the Notes will
develop and continue after the Offering. The Initial Purchasers (or persons acting on their behalf) have advised
the Issuer that they currently intend to make a market in the Notes. However, the Initial Purchasers are not
obligated to do so, and may discontinue any market-making activities with respect to the Notes at any time
without notice. In addition, market-making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the U.S. Securities Act
and the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “U.S. Exchange Act”), and may be limited. Accordingly, there
can be no assurance as to the liquidity of or the trading market for the Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating
_to the Notes—An active trading market may not develop for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes_
_will be more limited”._

Buyers of the Notes sold by the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp taxes, taxes and other charges in
accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the initial offering price set forth on
the cover of this offering memorandum.


-----

The Issuer expects that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the Notes on or about the date
specified on the cover page of this offering memorandum, which will be five business days (as such term is used
for the purposes of Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act) following the date of pricing of the Notes (this
settlement cycle is being referred to as “T+5“). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act, trades in the
secondary market generally are required to settle in three business days unless the parties to any such trade
expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of this offering
memorandum or the next two succeeding business days will be required to specify an alternative settlement cycle
at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such
trades should consult their own advisors.

In connection with the issue of the Notes, J.P. Morgan Securities plc or persons acting on its behalf may over-allot
Notes or effect transactions with a view to supporting the market price of the Notes at a level higher than that
which might otherwise prevail. However, there is no assurance that J.P. Morgan Securities plc or persons acting
on its behalf will undertake stabilization action. Any stabilization action may begin on or after the date on which
adequate public disclosure of the terms of the offer of Notes is made and, if begun, may be ended at any time, but
it must end no later than the earlier of 30 days after the Issue Date and 60 days after the date of the allotment of
the Notes.

The Initial Purchasers or their affiliates have from time to time and are currently providing and may provide in the
future commercial and investment banking, consultancy, financial advisory services and cash management
services for the Issuer, the Guarantors and their subsidiaries and affiliates for which they have received or may
receive customary fees and expenses. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may, from time to time, engage in
transactions with, and perform services for, the Issuer, the Guarantors and their subsidiaries and affiliates in the
ordinary course of their business. A portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the Notes in this Offering will be
used to repay indebtedness under our Existing Credit Facilities. Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates
are a lender or arranger in connection with the Existing Credit Facilities and in their capacities as lenders, will
receive a portion of the proceeds of the Offering. Certain Initial Purchasers or their affiliates are acting as
arrangers and lenders under, and certain other Initial Purchasers are expected to be lenders under, the Revolving
Credit Facility. Certain of the Initial Purchasers are affiliates of shareholders of Empark. See “Major
_Shareholders.”_

# Notice to Investors

_You are advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any offer, resale, pledge or other transfer of any of the_
_Notes offered hereby._

The Notes and the Note Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act, or the
securities laws of any other jurisdiction, and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold except pursuant to
an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and
the securities laws of any other applicable jurisdiction. Accordingly, the Notes offered hereby are being offered
and sold only to qualified institutional buyers (as defined in Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act) in reliance
on Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act and in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the
U.S. Securities Act.

We use the terms “offshore transaction” and “United States” with the meanings given to them in Regulation S.

Each purchaser of the Notes, by its acceptance thereof, will be deemed to have acknowledged, represented to
and agreed with the Issuer, each Guarantor and the Initial Purchasers as follows:

(1) The purchaser understands and acknowledges that the Notes and the Note Guarantees have not been
registered under the U.S. Securities Act or the securities laws of any other applicable jurisdiction and
that the Notes are being offered for resale in transactions not requiring registration under the
U.S. Securities Act or any other securities laws, including sales pursuant to Rule 144A under the
U.S. Securities Act, and, unless so registered, may not be offered, sold or otherwise transferred except
in compliance with the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and any other applicable
securities laws, pursuant to an exemption therefrom or in any transaction not subject thereto and in
each case in compliance with the conditions for transfer set forth in paragraphs (4) and (5) below.

(2) The purchaser is not an “affiliate” (as defined in Rule 144 under the U.S. Securities Act) of the Issuer
or any Guarantor, is not acting on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor and is either:

(a) a qualified institutional buyer, within the meaning of Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act
and is aware that any sale of these Notes to you will be made in reliance on Rule 144A under
the U.S. Securities Act, and such acquisition will be for your own account or for the account of
another qualified institutional buyer; or

(b) is purchasing the Notes in an offshore transaction in accordance with Regulation S under the
U.S. Securities Act.

(3) The purchaser acknowledges that none of the Issuer, the Guarantors, or the Initial Purchasers, nor any
person representing any of them, has made any representation to it with respect to us or the offer or
sale of any of the Notes, other than the information contained elsewhere in this offering memorandum,
which offering memorandum has been delivered to it and upon which it is relying in making its
investment decision with respect to the Notes. It acknowledges that neither the Initial Purchasers nor
any person representing the Initial Purchasers make any representation or warranty as to the accuracy
or completeness of this offering memorandum. It has had access to such financial and other
information concerning us and the Notes as it has deemed necessary in connection with its decision to
purchase any of the Notes, including an opportunity to ask questions of, and request information from,
the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers.

(4) The purchaser is purchasing the Notes for its own account, or for one or more investor accounts for
which it is acting as a fiduciary or agent, in each case for investment, and not with a view to, or for offer
or sale in connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of the U.S. Securities Act or any state or
other securities laws, subject to any requirement of law that the disposition of its property or the
property of such investor account or accounts be at all times within its or their control and subject to its
or their ability to resell such Notes pursuant to Rule 144A, Regulation S or any other exemption from
registration available under the U.S. Securities Act, or in any transaction not subject to the
U.S. Securities Act.

(5) If it is purchasing Notes pursuant to Rule 144A, it agrees on its own behalf and on behalf of any
investor account for which it is purchasing the Notes, and each subsequent holder of the Notes by its
acceptance thereof will be deemed to agree, to offer, sell or otherwise transfer such Notes prior to the
date (the “Resale Restriction Termination Date”) that is one year after the later of the date of the


-----

original issue and the last date on which we or any of our affiliates were the owner of such Notes (or
any predecessor thereto) only (i) to us, (ii) pursuant to a registration statement that has been declared
effective under the U.S. Securities Act, (iii) for so long as the Notes are eligible for resale pursuant to
Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act, to a person it reasonably believes is a qualified institutional
buyer that purchases for its own account or for the account of a qualified institutional buyer to whom
notice is given that the transfer is being made in reliance on Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act,
(iv) pursuant to offers and sales that occur outside the United States in compliance with Regulation S
under the U.S. Securities Act, or (v) pursuant to any other available exemption from the registration
requirements of the U.S. Securities Act, subject in each of the foregoing cases to any requirement of
law that the disposition of its property or the property of such investor account or accounts be at all
times within its or their control and to compliance with any applicable state securities laws, and any
applicable local laws and regulations, and further subject to our and the trustee’s rights prior to any
such offer, sale or transfer (I) pursuant to clause (v) to require the delivery of an opinion of counsel,
certification and/or other information satisfactory to each of them and (II) in each of the foregoing
cases, to require that a certificate of transfer in the form appearing on the reverse of the security is
completed and delivered by the transferor to the Trustee. The foregoing restrictions on resale will not
apply subsequent to the Resale Restriction Termination Date.

(6) Each purchaser acknowledges that each Rule 144A Note will contain a legend substantially to the
following effect:

“THIS NOTE HAS NOT BEEN AND WILL NOT BE REGISTERED UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES
ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE ‘‘U.S. SECURITIES ACT’’), OR OTHER SECURITIES LAWS OF
ANY STATE OR OTHER JURISDICTION. NEITHER THIS NOTE NOR ANY INTEREST OR

ACCEPTANCE HEREOF (1) REPRESENTS THAT (A) IT IS A ‘‘QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL
BUYER’’ (AS DEFINED IN RULE 144A UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT) OR (B) IT IS NOT A

MAY BE REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW (THE ‘‘RESALE RESTRICTION TERMINATION DATE’’),
OFFER, SELL OR OTHERWISE TRANSFER THIS NOTE EXCEPT (A) TO THE ISSUER,
(B) PURSUANT TO A REGISTRATION STATEMENT WHICH HAS BEEN DECLARED EFFECTIVE

REASONABLY BELIEVES IS A ‘‘QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL BUYER’’ AS DEFINED IN RULE 144A
UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT THAT PURCHASES FOR ITS OWN ACCOUNT OR FOR THE
ACCOUNT OF A QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL BUYER TO WHOM NOTICE IS GIVEN THAT THE
TRANSFER IS BEING MADE IN RELIANCE ON RULE 144A UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT,
(D) PURSUANT TO OFFERS AND SALES TO NON-U.S. PERSONS THAT OCCUR OUTSIDE THE
UNITED STATES IN COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATION S UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT OR
(E) PURSUANT TO ANY OTHER AVAILABLE EXEMPTION FROM THE REGISTRATION
REQUIREMENTS OF THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT, AND (3) AGREES THAT IT WILL GIVE TO EACH
PERSON TO WHOM THIS NOTE IS TRANSFERRED A NOTICE SUBSTANTIALLY TO THE EFFECT
OF THIS LEGEND; SUBJECT IN EACH OF THE FOREGOING CASES TO ANY REQUIREMENT OF
LAW THAT THE DISPOSITION OF ITS PROPERTY OR THE PROPERTY OF SUCH INVESTOR
ACCOUNT OR ACCOUNTS BE AT ALL TIMES WITHIN ITS OR THEIR CONTROL AND IN
COMPLIANCE WITH ANY APPLICABLE SECURITIES LAWS OF THE STATES OF THE UNITED
STATES AND OTHER JURISDICTIONS AND ANY APPLICABLE LOCAL LAWS AND


-----

REGULATIONS AND FURTHER SUBJECT TO THE ISSUER’S AND THE TRUSTEE’S RIGHTS
PRIOR TO ANY SUCH OFFER, SALE OR TRANSFER (I) PURSUANT TO CLAUSES (D) AND (E) TO
REQUIRE THE DELIVERY OF AN OPINION OF COUNSEL, CERTIFICATION AND/OR OTHER
INFORMATION SATISFACTORY TO EACH OF THEM AND (II) IN EACH OF THE FOREGOING
CASES, TO REQUIRE THAT A CERTIFICATE OF TRANSFER IN THE FORM APPEARING ON THE
OTHER SIDE OF THIS NOTE IS COMPLETED AND DELIVERED BY THE TRANSFEROR TO THE
TRUSTEE.

If the purchaser purchases Notes, it will also be deemed to acknowledge that the foregoing restrictions
apply to holders of beneficial interests in these Notes as well as to holders of these Notes.

(7) The purchaser agrees that it will give to each person to whom it transfers the Notes notice of any
restrictions on the transfer of such Notes.

(8) The purchaser acknowledges that until 40 days after the commencement of the Offering, any offer or
sale of the Notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the Offering) may
violate the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise
than in accordance with Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act.

(9) The purchaser acknowledges that the Registrar will not be required to accept for registration or
transfer any Notes acquired by it except upon presentation of evidence satisfactory to the Issuer and
the Registrar that the restrictions set forth therein have been complied with.

(10) The purchaser acknowledges that the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers and others will rely
upon the truth and accuracy of its acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements
and agrees that if any of the acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements deemed
to have been made by its purchase of the Notes are no longer accurate, it shall promptly notify the
Initial Purchasers. If it is acquiring any Notes as a fiduciary or agent for one or more investor accounts,
it represents that it has sole investment discretion with respect to each such investor account and that
it has full power to make the foregoing acknowledgements, representations and agreements on behalf
of each such investor account.

(11) The purchaser understands that no action has been taken in any jurisdiction (including the
United States) by the Issuer, the Guarantors or the Initial Purchasers that would result in a public
offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of this offering memorandum or any
other material relating to us or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for such purpose is required.
Consequently, any transfer of the Notes will be subject to the selling restrictions set forth under “Plan
_of Distribution” and “Important Information”._

-----

# Enforcement of Civil Liabilities

The Issuer is incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg and none of its directors are residents of the United
States. Furthermore, a substantial portion of the Issuer’s assets and a substantial portion of the assets of such
persons are located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of
process within the United States upon the Issuer or such persons, or to enforce against them judgments of U.S.
courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. Federal or state securities laws.

If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. court against the Issuer or a Guarantor, purchasers will need to enforce such
judgment in jurisdictions where the relevant company has assets. Even though the enforceability of U.S. court
judgments outside the United States is described below for the countries in which the Issuer and the Guarantors
are located, you should consult with your own advisors in any pertinent jurisdictions as needed to enforce a
judgment in those countries or elsewhere outside the United States.

**Luxembourg**

We have been advised by our Luxembourg counsel that the United States and Luxembourg are not currently
bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards
rendered in civil and commercial matters. According to such counsel, an enforceable judgment for the payment of
monies rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon
the U.S. securities laws, would not be directly enforceable in Luxembourg. However, a party who received such
favorable judgment from a U.S. state or federal court, may initiate enforcement proceedings in Luxembourg
(exequatur) by requesting enforcement of the U.S. judgment by the District Court (Tribunal d’Arrondissement)
pursuant to Article 678 et seq. of the Luxembourg Nouveau Code de Procédure Civile. The District Court will
authorize the enforcement in Luxembourg of the U.S. judgment if it is satisfied that all of the following conditions
are met:

- the U.S. court awarding the judgment has jurisdiction to adjudicate the respective matter under its applicable
U.S. Federal or state jurisdictions rules, and the jurisdiction of such U.S. court is recognized by Luxembourg
private international and local law;

- the U.S. judgment is final and enforceable (exécutoire) in the in the United States;

- the U.S. court has applied the substantive law as designated by the Luxembourg conflict of laws rules or, at
least, the court order must not contravene the principles underlying those rules;

- the U.S. court must have applied the proper law to the matter submitted to it and has acted in accordance with
its own procedural laws;

- the U.S. judgment must not have been obtained subsequent to an evasion of Luxembourg law (fraude à la loi
_luxembourgeoise) and must have been granted following proceedings where the counterparty had the_
opportunity to appear, and if appeared, to present a defense; and

- the U.S. judgment does not contravene international public policy or order as understood under the laws of
Luxembourg and has not been given in proceedings of a criminal, penal or tax nature (which would include
awards of damages made under civil liabilities provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws, or other laws, to
the extent that the same would be classified by Luxembourg courts as being of a penal or punitive nature (for
example, fines or punitive damages)).

Subject to the above conditions, Luxembourg courts tend not to review the merits of a foreign judgment, although
there is no statutory prohibition.

We have also been advised by our Luxembourg counsel that if an original action is brought in Luxembourg,
Luxembourg courts may refuse to apply the designated law (i) if the choice of such law was not made bona fide,
or (ii) if the foreign law was not pleaded and proved or (iii) if pleaded and proved, such foreign law would be
contrary to mandatory Luxembourg laws or manifestly incompatible with Luxembourg public policy or public order
rules. In an action brought in Luxembourg on the basis of U.S. Federal or state securities laws, Luxembourg
courts may not have the requisite power to grant the remedies sought. Also, an exequatur may be refused in
respect of punitive damages.

Further, in the event of any proceedings being brought in a Luxembourg court in respect of a monetary obligation
expressed to be payable in a currency other than euro, a Luxembourg court would have power to give judgment
expressed as an order to pay a currency other than euro. However, enforcement of the judgment against any


-----

party in Luxembourg would be available only in euro and for such purposes all claims or debts would be
converted into euro.

**Spain and Portugal**

Empark and certain other of the Subsidiary Guarantors are organized under the laws of Spain with limited liability.
The controlling shareholders of Empark, and the directors and the executive officers of Empark and the other
Spanish Guarantors are non-residents of the United States and a significant portion of the assets of such persons
are located outside the United States. As a result, in order to enforce in Spain a judgment entered in another
jurisdiction, the service of process on such persons or Empark or the other Spanish Guarantors outside Spain
must be made in accordance with the Law of Civil Procedure (Ley de Enjuiciamiento Civil). An investor may also
experience difficulty in effecting service of process on or enforcing judgments against such persons or Empark or
the other Spanish Guarantors based on civil liability provisions of the U.S. Federal and state securities laws or
other laws.

We have been advised by our Spanish counsel that the United States and Spain are not currently bound by a
treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments. In the absence of any such treaty or
proof that similar Spanish judgments are not recognized and enforced in the jurisdiction rendering the judgment
(in which case the judgment will not be recognized in Spain), such judgment will be recognized and enforced in
Spain provided that it meets the following requirements:

(i) the U.S. foreign judgment must be final, translated into Spanish and apostilled;

(ii) the U.S. foreign judgment shall not be contrary to Spanish public policy;

(iii) there shall not be a pending proceeding between the same parties and in relation to the same
issues in Spain;

(iv) there shall not be a judgment rendered between the same parties and for the same cause of action
in Spain or in another country provided that in this latter case the judgment has been recognized in
Spain;

(v) where rendering the U.S. foreign judgment, the courts rendering it must not have infringed an
exclusive ground of jurisdiction provided for in Spanish law or have based their jurisdiction on
exorbitant grounds;

(vi) the rights of defense of the defendant should have been protected where rending the foreign
judgment, including but not limited to a proper service of process carried out with sufficient time for
the defendant to prepare its defense and appear before the courts;

(vii) the legal action has to be taken with acknowledgment and appearance of the defendant in the
proceeding; and

(viii) the obligation that the petitioner tries to execute has to be lawful in Spain.

Certain of the Guarantors, including Emparque, are organized under the laws of Portugal with limited liability. The
directors and the executive officers of the Portuguese Guarantors are non-residents of the United States and a
significant portion of the assets of such persons are located outside the United States. As a result, in order to
enforce in Portugal a judgment entered in another jurisdiction, the service of process on such persons or the
Portuguese Guarantors outside Portugal must be made in accordance with the Portuguese Code of Civil
Procedure. An investor may also experience difficulty in effecting service of process on or enforcing judgments
against such persons or the Portuguese Guarantors based on civil liability provisions of the U.S., Federal and
state securities laws or other laws.

We have been advised by our Portuguese counsel that the United States and Portugal are not currently bound by
a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments. In the absence of any such treaty such
judgment will be recognized and enforced in Portugal according to the procedures set out in Portuguese Code of
Civil Procedure for the recognition of foreign judgments provided that it meets the following requirements:

(i) the judgment must be final, translated into Portuguese and apostilled without doubts as to the
authenticity of the document and the contents of the judgment;

(ii) the judgment shall not be contrary to Portuguese public policy and the obligation that the petitioner
is attempting to execute has to be lawful in Portugal;


-----

(iii) there shall not be a pending proceeding between the same parties and in relation to the same
issues in Portugal;

(iv) there shall not be a judgment rendered between the same parties and for the same cause of action
in Portugal or in another country;

(v) the matters under discussion shall not be related to matters in which the Portuguese courts consider
themselves exclusively competent, and the competency of such foreign courts shall not have been
obtained by unlawfully circumventing applicable rules; and

(vi) the rights of defense of the defendant should have been protected when rendering the foreign
judgment (princípio do contraditório), including but not limited to a proper service of process carried
out with sufficient time for the defendant to prepare its defense and appear before the courts and
notification (citação), and with respect for the principle of equal treatment of the parties.

**_1.2 Changes in the scope_**

**30/09/2013**

- The main changes in the consolidation scope over the nine-month period of 2013 were as follows:

At the beginning of 2013 Empark Portugal – Empreendimentos e Exploraçao de Parqueamentos S.A constituted the

**2 Summary of the main accounting policies**

**_2.1 Basis of presentation_**

The consolidated financial information presented in these Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements has
been drawn up using the International Financial Reporting Standards adopted by the European Union (IFRS-EU).
Regarding the methods used to apply these regulations, it is worth mentioning that the Group has opted to value
tangible fixed assets and intangible assets at historical cost, capitalizing financial costs during the construction period,
and in the case of jointly controlled companies and Joint Ventures with existing companies, to consolidate the same
using the proportionate consolidation method. These Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements were
drawn up under the provisions of IAS 34.

The Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements do not contain all the information and breakdowns
required for annual financial reporting and thus must be read together with the Consolidated Financial Statements for


-----

(IFRS) currently applicable in the European Union.

The Group applied the IFRS-EU to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the first time in financial year 2009.

**_2.2 Accounting standards applied_**

_a) Standards and interpretations approved by the European Union, which are applicable to this financial year._

The accounting policies applied on drawing up the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the ninemonth period ending 30 September 2013 are the same as those applied in the Consolidated Financial Statements for
the financial year ended 31 December 2012, except for the following amendments and interpretations:

- IFRS 13 “Measurement of Fair Value: IFRS 13 establishes one single guide for all fair-value valuations in
accordance with the IFRS. IFRS 13 does not affect when the fair value must be used, but does offer a guide as to
how to establish the fair value in accordance with the IFRS where this is required or permitted. The modification
affects only presentation, and has no impact either on the financial situation or the results of the Group.

- IAS 19 revised, “Employee Benefits”: The modifications range from fundamental changes, such as the elimination
of the broker method and the concept of yields expected from assets covered by the plan, to simple clarifications
and revision. This modification will, however, affect the net expenditure through benefits, as the expected return on
the assets associated with the plan will be calculated on the basis of the same rate of interest as that applied in
order to calculate the benefits-based obligation. The modification affects only presentation, and has no impact
either on the financial situation or the results of the Group.

- Amendment to IAS 1 “Presentation of items of another comprehensive result”: The modifications to IAS 1 change
the grouping of entries presented in another overall result. The items that may be reclassified (or “recycled”) in the
income statement at some point in the future are presented separately from the items that can never be
reclassified. The modification affects only presentation, and has no impact either on the financial situation or the
results of the Group.

- Amendment to IFRS 7 “Disclosures – Compensation of financial assets and financial liabilities”: These
modifications require the disclosure of information about offset rights and similar agreements (for example,
collateral agreements). The disclosures will provide information of use to users in evaluating the effect of
presentation of these agreements for net sums in the entity’s financial position. The new disclosures are mandatory
for all those financial instruments offset in accordance with the terms of IAS 32. These changes did not have any
impact on the Group as it does not have any agreements of this kind in place.

- Amendment to IAS 12 “Deferred tax: Recovery of underlying assets”: The modification clarifies the calculation of
deferred taxes on real estate investments recorded at the fair value, including a presumption that the deferred taxes
on real estate investments valued using the fair value model described in IAS 40 should be established on the
basis that their book value will be recovered through sale. It furthermore introduces the requirement that the
deferred taxes on non-amortisable assets valued by means of the revaluation method described in IAS 16 should in
all cases be calculated on the basis of the sale of those assets. This change did not have any impact on the
Group’s financial position, results or disclosures.

- IFRS IC 20 “Stripping costs in the production phase of a surface mine”: This interpretation applies to waste removal
costs (excavation) incurred during the production phase of an opencast mine. The interpretation establishes the
manner in which the profits derived from the excavation activity are to be accounted for. This new interpretation did
not have any effect on the Group.

- IFRS improvements for the period 2009-2011: This document introduces a series of improvements to the current
IFRS, essentially to eliminate inconsistencies and to clarify the wording of some of these standards. These
improvements have not have any effect on the Group’s results or financial position.

_b) Standards and interpretations published by the IASB and approved by the European Union but not applicable for_
_this period._

As of the publication of these Consolidated Financial Statements, the following standards, changes and interpretation
have been published by the IASB and approved by the European Union but their application is not mandatory:

- IFRS 10 “Consolidated Financial Statements”: IFRS 10 establishes one single supervisory model applied to all
entities, including special purpose entities. The changes introduced by IFRS 10 will require Senior Management to
make substantial judgements in establishing which companies are controlled, and must therefore be consolidated
by the Dominant Company, in comparison with the requirements which would be set out in IAS 27. In accordance
with the preliminary analysis performed, IFRS 10 is not expected to have any impact on the investments currently
held by the Group. IFRS 10 is applicable to financial years beginning as of 1 January 2014.


-----

the proportional consolidation method. Jointly controlled companies are instead defined as joint entities, and must
be accounted for by using the equity method. The Group is currently evaluating the impact that this new standard
will have on the Group’s financial situation and results, although on the basis of the preliminary analyses no
significant impacts are expected. This standard will take effect for financial years beginning as of 1 January 2014.

- IFRS 12 “Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities”: IFRS 12 includes the disclosures previously listed under IAS 27
regarding the consolidated management report, in addition to all disclosures previously included in IAS 31 and IAS
28. These disclosures refer to stakes in dependent companies, joint agreements, associated entities and structured
entities. New, additional disclosures are also required, although this has no impact on the financial position or
results of the Group. This standard will take effect for financial years beginning as of 1 January 2014.

- IAS 28 revised, “Investment in Associates and Joint Ventures”: This standard now also describes the application of
the equity method to investments in joint ventures and to associated entities. The modification will take effect for
financial years beginning as of 1 January 2014.

- Amendment to IAS 32 “Compensation of financial assets and financial liabilities”: These modifications clarify the
meaning of “where a legal applicable right to offset is held”. These modifications likewise clarify application of the
principal of offsetting settlement systems (such as F-15ecognizedF-15 cash management systems) which apply
offset mechanisms based on gross sums items which do not arise simultaneously. These modifications are not
expected to have any form of impact on the financial situation or results of the Group, and will take effect for
financial years beginning as of 1 January 2014.

- Amendment to IFRS 10, IFRS 11 and IFRS 12 “Transition Guide”: This amendment limits the disclosure
requirements in relation to comparative information applicable to financial years beginning as of 01 January 2014.

The Group intends to adopt these standards, modifications and interpretation, if applicable, when they come into
force. The Group is current F-15ecognize their impact. On the basis of the analysis carried out to-date, the Group
believes that their application will not have a significant impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

_c) Standards and interpretations published by the IASB and yet to be approved by the European Union_

As of the publication of these Consolidated Financial Statements, the following non-mandatory standard, changes and
interpretation have been published by the IASB, but have not been approved by the European Union:

- IFRS 9 “Financial instruments”: Applicable to financial years beginning as of 01 January 2015 for the IASB.

- Amendment to IFRS 9 and IFRS 7 “Date of mandatory application and disclosures in transition”: Applicable to
financial years beginning as of 01 January 2015 for the IASB.

- Amendment to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IFRS 27 “Investment Entities”: Applicable to financial years beginning as of
01 January 2014 for the IASB.

- Amendment to IFRS 36 “Recoverable amounts disclosures for non-financial assets”: Applicable to financial years
beginning as of 01 January 2014 for the IASB.

- Amendment to IFRS 39 “Novation of derivatives and continuation of hedge accounting”: Applicable to financial
years beginning as of 01 January 2014 for the IASB.

- IFRIC 21 “Levies”: Applicable to financial years beginning as of 01 January 2014 for the IASB.

The Group is currently assessing the impact of applying these standards and amendments. On the basis of the
analysis carried out to-date, the Group believes that their application will not have a significant impact on the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

**_2.4 Comparison of the information_**

Consolidated Statements of Financial Situation.

In compliance with accounting and legal regulations and the procedures applicable to these Interim Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements, the directors present, for comparative purposes, information from the financial
statements for the period ended as of 30 September 2013 in addition to those for the period ended as of 31 December
2012.

Consolidated Statements of Income, Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Statements
of Changes in Net Equity and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow.

In compliance with accounting and legal regulations and with the procedures applicable to these Interim Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements, the directors present, for comparative purposes, with each item of the
Consolidated Statements of Income, Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Statements
of Changes in Net Equity and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow, the figures for the nine-month period ending
30 September 2013 in addition to those for the nine-month period ending 30 September 2012.

**_2.5 Company operating with negative working capital_**

As of 30 September 2013, the Group reports a negative working capital of (23,556) thousands of Euros and of
(40,789) thousands of Euros as of 31 December 2012. This circumstance, which could be indicative of uncertainty
regarding continuation of the Group, is mitigated by the fact that these types of situation are common in groups such
as the present where a large part of turnover is collected in cash.

Additionally, the Group operates a cash-pooling system by which Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A. manages
treasury requirements at Group level.

Furthermore the group has credit lines and other financial resources available to meet its treasury needs (Note 15).

Therefore, the Board of Directors considers that the operating company principle is the appropriate basis for
preparation of these Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. This entails realization of assets and
liquidation of liabilities in accordance with the amounts and classification criteria set forth said Interim Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements.

**_2.6 Accounting estimates and assumptions_**

These Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contain estimates made by the directors of the
Controlling Company and consolidated companies to quantify some of the assets, liabilities, income, expenses and
commitments shown in said statements. Basically, these estimates refer to:

- Evaluation of potential losses due to impairment of certain assets.

- Useful life of tangible and intangible assets.

- Estimates related to the fair value of assets purchased in business combinations and goodwill.

- Assessment of possible contingencies due to legal and tax risks.

- Recovery of deferred tax assets.

These estimates were made on the basis of the best information available at 30 September 2013 and at 31 December
2012 regarding the circumstances analysed. However, it is possible that events that may occur in the future require
modifying these estimates, which would be carried out in accordance with IAS 8 if applicable.


-----

The Group manages its investments after having performed thorough inspection and assessment of potentially
attractive projects from the environmental, socio-occupational, commercial, financial and economic perspectives, for
the purpose of achieving a sustainable and balanced growth.

In carrying out this task, the Group’s shareholders seek a balanced position regarding expected investment profits and
the risk assumed.

**_2.8 Consolidation criteria_**

As of 30 September 2013 the Group closed the accounting period for presentation of the individual financial
statements of all group companies included within the consolidation scope at the same date. Likewise, for the purpose
of uniformity in the presentation of items comprising these Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements,
uniform accounting criteria has been applied on the basis of the Controlling Company’s accounting policies. These
Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been drawn up on the basis of the following methods:

**a.** **Full consolidation method: all companies considered subsidiaries are fully consolidated. For these purposes,**
subsidiaries are those companies in which Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A. maintains effective control
because it directly or indirectly, by means of agreements with other shareholders, holds more than 50% of the
voting rights. In assessing whether the Group controls another F-17ecognizedF-17i, consideration is given to the
existence and impact of currently exercisable or convertible potential voting rights. Inclusion within the scope of
consolidation of the Group is carried out from the time at which control of the subsidiary becomes effective. The
value of shares held by minority shareholders in equity and in the result of the financial year of fully consolidated
subsidiaries is listed in chapters “Minority interests” of the Consolidated Statements of Financial Situation and
“Result attributed to Minority interests” of the Comprehensive Statement of Consolidated Income.

**b.** **Equity method: companies considered to constitute associates are consolidated by the equity method. For**
these purposes, associate companies are defined as all this in which the Group has significant influence over
management but does not exercise control or joint management with third parties. Under the equity method, the
percentage of equity held in the associate company with reference to both net equity and the result of the year is
F-17ecognized.

**c.** **Proportionate consolidation method: applied to joint ventures, which are businesses in which management of**
subsidiaries is carried out jointly under contract by the controlling company and by third parties not related to the
group. Assets and liabilities assigned to joint ventures or those jointly controlled with other parties are reported in
the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position classified in accordance with the specific nature of the holding
as defined by percentage. Likewise, income and expenditure arising from joint ventures are recognized in the
Consolidated Statement of Income, also in accordance the nature of the holding as defined by percentage.

**d.** **Balances and transactions with Group companies: balances and transactions with Group companies are**
written off in the consolidation process.

**e.** **Conversion of financial statements to currencies different from the Euro: financial statements of**
subsidiaries and joint ventures whose accounting records are in a currency other than the Euro are converted to
Euros by applying the end of period exchange rates to all assets and liabilities except equity, which is converted
using the rate at the time the item was included in the group. Within the consolidation process shares held in
group companies are written off against shareholder equity, except in associated companies, which are
converted at the closing rate.

Result is converted to Euros at the average exchange rate for the year. Differences arising during the conversion
process are entered to shareholder equity as “currency exchange rate differences”.

_a) Dependent companies_

The acquisition cost method is used to determine the book value of newly acquired subsidiaries. The cost of
acquisition is the fair value of the assets handed over, the asset instruments shared and liabilities incurred or assumed
on the date of exchange, the fair value of any additional consideration dependent on future events (provided that
these are probable and can be reliably valuated).

When the control is acquired in stages, the goodwill (or the negative difference in consolidation) is determined in each
of the individual transactions as the difference between the book value of the participation and the net sum attributable
to the participation in terms of the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities assumed on said date. The
identifiable assets and liabilities assumed are incorporated on the basis of the fair value at the time the control is
acquired, and minority interests share must be included for an amount proportional to their equity holding.


-----

the control is acquired, and the corresponding value on each of the dates on which the participations were acquired,
gives rise to an adjustment in the Group’s reserves, net of tax effect.

At the start of 2013, Sociedad Orange Park – Gestao de Parques de Estacionamneto S.A., Parkivens – Imobiliario e
Servicos S.A. and Maksu Services S.A. were incorporated.

_b) Associated companies_

When the equity method procedure is first applied, investments in associated companies are valued at the amount
corresponding to the percentage represented by the holding at the time of the investment, based on the fair value of
the assets acquired and liabilities incurred. If the resulting difference between the cost of the holding and this value is
positive it is included in the book value of the investment. In the event that it is negative, the difference is entered
directly to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Any variations not involving third parties occurring during the current financial year in Group net equity included in the
Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements under the equity method proportionately increase or reduce, as
applicable, the book value of the holding in question once any F-18ecognizedF-18i and impairment occurring since the
method was applied for the first time are taken into account, and after elimination of the proportion based on results of
transactions between the aforesaid company and the company holding the interest, or any other group company.

Profits allocated by the Group and included in the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements under the
equity method reduce the book value of the holding.

Temporary evaluative homogeneity is applied to associated investments in the same way as for subsidiaries.

_c) TJVs (Temporary Joint Ventures) Companies as Joint Ventures_

Non-realised results deriving from reciprocal transactions are written off in proportion to the holding, in addition to the
amounts of reciprocal assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and cash flows.

**_2.9 Principal measurement rules applying to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements._**

The main valuation rules and accounting criteria used in drawing up these Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements are consistent with those used and set forth in the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements for the
financial year ending 31 December 2012.

_2.9.1 Concession intangible and financial assets_

The Group constructs or upgrades infrastructure (construction or upgrade services) used to provide a public service
and operates and maintains that infrastructure (operation services) for a specified period of time. These arrangements
may include Infrastructure used in a public-to-private service concession arrangement for its entire useful life.

These arrangements are accounted for based on the nature of the consideration. The intangible asset model is used
to the extent that the Group receives a right (a licence) to charge users of the public service. The financial asset model
is used when the Group has an unconditional contractual right to receive cash or another financial asset from or at the
direction of the grantor for the construction services. When the unconditional right to receive cash covers only part of
the service, the two models are combined to account separately for each component. If the Group performs more than
one service (i.e., construction or upgrade services and operation services) under a single contract or arrangement,
consideration received or receivable is allocated by reference to the relative fair values of the services delivered, when
the amounts are separately identifiable.

- An intangible asset is measured at the fair value of consideration transferred to acquire the asset, which is the fair
value of the consideration received or receivable for the construction services delivered. The intangible asset is
amortised over its expected useful life in a way that reflects the pattern in which the asset’s economic benefits are
consumed by the entity, starting from the date when the right to operate starts to be used (for example, in a toll
road concession the Group uses the number of cars that use the road). Based on these principles, the intangible
asset is amortised in line with the actual usage of the specific public facility, with a maximum of the duration of the
concession.

- In the financial asset model, the amount due from the grantor meets the definition of a receivable which is
measured at fair value. It is subsequently measured at amortised cost. The amount initially F-18ecognized plus the
cumulative interest on that amount is calculated using the effective interest method.

Any asset carried under concession arrangements is F-18ecognizedF-18i on disposal or when no future economic
benefits are expected from its future use or disposal or when the contractual rights to the financial asset expire.


-----

Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible assets
acquired in a business combination is their fair value at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible
assets are carried at cost less any accumulated F-19ecognizedF-19i and accumulated impairment losses.

Internally generated intangible assets, excluding F-19ecognizedF-19 development costs, are not F-19ecognizedF-19
and expenditure is reflected in profit and loss in the period in which the expenditure is incurred.

The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as either finite or indefinite.

Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over the useful economic life and assessed for impairment whenever
there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The F-19ecognizedF-19i period and the
F-19ecognizedF-19i method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at the end of each
reporting period. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic
benefits embodied in the asset are considered to modify the F-19ecognizedF-19i period or method, as appropriate,
and are treated as changes in accounting estimates. The F-19ecognizedF-19i expense on intangible assets with finite
lives is F-19ecognized in the income statement as the expense category that is consistent with the function of the
intangible assets.

Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortised, but are tested for impairment annually, either
individually or at the cash-generating unit level. The assessment of indefinite life is reviewed annually to determine
whether the indefinite life continues to be supportable. If not, the change in useful life from indefinite to finite is made
on a prospective basis.

Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net
disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are F-19ecognized in the income statement when the
asset is F-19ecognizedF-19i.

a) Concessions

Concessions includes essentially the licence fees satisfied in certain concessions for operating car parks.

These administrative concessions are entered to assets at cost less accrued F-19ecognizedF-19i and accrued
valuation corrections due to impairment.

Concessions also include access rights paid by means of a concession fee during the period of the concession. In this
case the concessions are included under the assets at the current value of the minimum agreed payments, without
taking into consideration contingent payments.

The concessions are amortised on a linear basis over the term of the concession.

b) IT applications

Licences acquired from third parties for computer programmes are F-19ecognizedF-19 on the basis of acquisition
costs and the cost of adaptation to the specific programmes.

The Company depreciates its computer applications on a straight-line basis, distributing the cost of the assets over the
estimated useful life of the same, which is three years.

Costs involved in the development or maintenance of computer programs are F-19ecognized as an expense at the
time they are incurred. Costs directly related to the production of single identifiable computer programmes controlled
by the Company and which will probably generate revenues greater than the costs during more than one year are
F-19ecognized as intangible assets. Direct costs include programme development, personnel expenses and a suitable
proportion of overheads.

_2.9.3 Property, plant and equipment_

Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses,
if any. Such cost includes the cost of replacing part of the property, plant and equipment and borrowing costs for longterm construction projects if the recognition criteria are met. When significant parts of property, plant and equipment
are required to be replaced at intervals, the Group F-19ecognized such parts as individual assets with specific useful
lives and depreciates them accordingly. Likewise, when a major inspection is performed, its cost is F-19ecognized in
the carrying amount of the plant and equipment as a replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied. All other
repair and maintenance costs are F-19ecognized in profit or loss as incurred.

Property, plant and equipment transferred from customers is initially measured at the fair value at the date on which
control is obtained.


-----

Land and buildings are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation on buildings and impairment losses
F-20ecognized.

Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:

**Useful life in years**
Buildings and other structures ................................................................................................................................ 50

Machinery, installations and tools................................................................................................................................10
Furnishings ................................................................................................................................................................ 10
Transport vehicles ........................................................................................................................................................ 6
Other fixed assets......................................................................................................................................................... 3

An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant part initially F-20ecognized is F-20ecognizedF-20i upon
disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on
derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of
the asset) is included in the income statement when the asset is F-20ecognizedF-20i.

The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each
financial year end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.

Car parks F-20ecognized in tangible assets (under the head of “Buildings”) are valued at acquisition price or
production cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the term of the concession.

_2.9.4 Borrowing costs_

Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes a
substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale are F-20ecognizedF-20 as part of the cost of the
asset. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they occur. Borrowing costs consist of interest
and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds.

_2.9.5 Financial assets_

a) Loans and receivable:

Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in
an active market. After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using
the effective interest rate method, less impairment. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or
premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the effective interest rate. The effective interest
rate F-20ecognizedF-20i is included in finance income in the income statement. The losses arising from impairment
are F-20ecognized in the income statement in finance costs for loans and in cost of sales or other operating expenses
for receivables.

b) Investments in the equity of group, multi-group and associated companies:

These are valued at cost less accrued impairment corrections, if any. Notwithstanding, in the event that investment in
a company is prior to classification of the same as a Group, Multi-group or Associated Company, the cost of the
investment is considered to be the book value prior to such classification. Prior valuation adjustments directly entered
to net equity are maintained until cancellation.

Investments in equity of group and associated companies are F-20ecognized in the books, in both current and noncurrent assets.

Current assets include short-term investments comprising corporate loans and other financial assets in group and
associated companies.

The balance of long-term investments comprising equity instruments in group and associated companies are
registered in non-current assets. Asset instruments are broken down in the balances of holdings in group companies,
holdings in associated companies and share disbursements pending and not called on.

In the event of objective evidence that book value is unrecoverable, the relevant valuation correction is applied as the
difference between book value and the recoverable amount, the latter understood as whichever is the greater between
fair value less sales costs and the current value of future cash flows deriving from the investment.


-----

Derivative financial instruments are initially F-21ecognized at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is
entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair
value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative.

Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives are taken directly to profit or loss, except for
the effective portion of cash flow hedges, which is F-21ecognized in other comprehensive income.

The Group is only necessary Cash flow hedges:

The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is F-21ecognized directly in other comprehensive
income in the cash flow hedge reserve, while any ineffective portion is F-21ecognized immediately in the income
statement as other operating expenses.

Amounts F-21ecognized as other comprehensive income are transferred to profit or loss when the hedged transaction
affects profit or loss, such as when the hedged financial income or financial expense is F-21ecognized or when a
forecast sale occurs. When the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset or non-financial liability, the amounts
F-21ecognized as other comprehensive income are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset
or liability.

If the forecast transaction or firm commitment is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss previously
F-21ecognized in equity is transferred to the income statement. If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated
or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, any cumulative gain or loss
previously F-21ecognized in other comprehensive income remains in other comprehensive income until the forecast
transaction or firm commitment affects profit or loss.

_2.9.7 Business combinations and goodwill_

Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the
aggregate of the consideration transferred measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. For each business combination, the Group elects whether to measure the noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets.
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred and included in administrative expenses.

When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate
classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent
conditions as at the acquisition date. This includes the separation of embedded derivatives in host contracts by the
acquiree.

If the business combination is achieved in stages, the previously held equity interest is remeasured at its acquisition
date fair value and any resulting gain or loss is F-21ecognized in profit or loss.

Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be F-21ecognized at fair value at the acquisition
date.

Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the
amount F-21ecognized for non-controlling interest over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If
the fair value of the net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate consideration transferred, the gain is
F-21ecognized in profit or loss.

After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of
impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the
Group’s cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets
or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.

Where goodwill has been allocated to a cash-generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of,
the goodwill associated with the disposed operation is included in the carrying amount of the operation when
determining the gain or loss on disposal. Goodwill disposed in these circumstances is measured based on the relative
values of the disposed operation and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained.

_2.9.8 Stock_

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net F-21ecognized value.

The cost of finished products and products in progress corresponds to construction in progress and completed, and
includes costs incurred in construction of car parks intended for concession.

Parking spaces intended for sale and included in inventories are valued at acquisition price or production cost.


-----

completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.

_2.9.9 Cash and other equivalent liquid assets_

Cash and short-term deposits in the Condensed Interim Consolidated Statement of Financial Position comprise cash
at banks and on hand and short-term deposits with a maturity of three months or less.

This section includes short-term restricted cash flow. This item includes investments of the same nature and expiry
date related to financing of specific infrastructure projects, the availability of which is restricted by financing contracts
as guarantee of meeting specific short-term obligations relative to payment of interest or principle of the debt and for
future maintenance of the infrastructure.

_2.9.10 Net Equity_

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net profit attributed to the controlling company by the average
weighted number of ordinary shares in circulation during said period. In turn, diluted earnings per share is calculated
by dividing net income attributable to ordinary shareholders by the average weighted number of ordinary shares in
circulation during the period, since there are no shared equity instruments which could be converted to shares in the
Controlling Company in the future.

With regard to the Group’s Consolidated Annual Financial Statements for the financial years ended on 31 December
2012 and the present Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of 30 September 2013, there is no
discrepancy between basic and diluted earnings per share.

_2.9.11 Transactions between related parties_

As a general rule transactions between related parties initially F-22ecognized at fair value. Where appropriate, if the
agreed price differs from fair value the difference is entered according to the financial reality of the transaction.
Subsequent valuation is carried out in compliance with the provisions of the corresponding accounting standards.

_2.9.12 Subsidies_

Government grants are F-22ecognized where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and all
attached conditions will be complied with. When the grant relates to an expense item, it is F-22ecognized as income
on a systematic basis over the periods that the costs, which it is intended to compensate, are expensed. When the
grant relates to an asset, it is F-22ecognized as income in equal amounts over the expected useful life of the related
asset.

When the Group receives non-monetary grants, the asset and the grant are recorded at nominal amounts and
released to profit or loss over the expected useful life in a pattern of consumption of the benefit of the underlying asset
by equal annual instalments. When loans or similar assistance are provided by governments or related institutions,
with an interest rate below the current applicable market rate, the effect of this favourable interest is regarded as a
government grant.

_2.9.13 Provisions and contingent liabilities_

Provisions are F-22ecognized when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past
event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation
and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. When the Group expects some or all of a
provision to be reimbursed, for example, under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is F-22ecognized as a
separate asset, but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense relating to a provision is presented
in the income statement net of any reimbursement.

Contingent liabilities are possible obligations arising as a result of past events, the F-22ecognizedF-22ionF-22 of
which depends on whether or not one or more future events outside the control of the Group occurs.

Given the activities in which the Group is currently engaged, it has no liabilities, expenses, assets or provisions and
contingencies of an environmental nature which could prove significant with reference to net equity, the financial
situation or result. Hence, specific breakdowns of information on environmental shares are not included in this report
on the annual financial statements.

Costs deriving from protection and improvement of the environment are attributed to consolidated result for the
financial year in which they are incurred, regardless of when the associated monetary or financial flow occurs.

When such expenses involve the acquisition of tangible assets the purpose of which is to F-22ecogniz environmental
impact and to protect and improve the environment, these are F-22ecognized as increased value of fixed assets.


-----

Financial liabilities are classified as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, loans and borrowings, or as
derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate. The Group determines the
classification of its financial liabilities at initial recognition.

All financial liabilities are F-23ecognized initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings, net of directly
attributable transaction costs.

The Group’s financial liabilities include trade and other payables, loans and borrowings and derivative financial
instruments.

The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification as described below:

**_Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss_**

Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities
designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss.

Financial liabilities are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling in the near term. This
category includes derivative financial instruments entered into by the Group that are not designated as hedging
instruments in hedge relationships. Separated embedded derivatives are also classified as held for trading unless they
are designated as effective hedging instruments.

Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are F-23ecognized in the income statement.

Financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss are designated at the initial
date of recognition, and only if the criteria in IAS 39 are satisfied. The Group has not designated any financial liability
as at fair value through profit or loss.

**_Loans and borrowings_**

After initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the
effective interest rate method. Gains and losses are F-23ecognized in profit or loss when the liabilities are
F-23ecognizedF-23i as well as through the effective interest rate F-23ecognizedF-23i process.

Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are
an integral part of the effective interest rate. The effective interest rate F-23ecognizedF-23i is included as finance
costs in the income statement.

**_Derecognition_**

A financial liability is F-23ecognizedF-23i when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled, or expires.

When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the
terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the
derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying
amounts is F-23ecognized in the income statement.

_2.9.15 Income tax and deferred taxes_

As of 1 January 2005 the Group began paying tax under the consolidated tax system with Cintra Concessions de
Infraestructuras de Transporte S.A. as a result of the change in ownership which occurred in 2004, following which the
Parent Company fell within the aforesaid tax Consolidation perimeter. The Group previously paid taxes under the
consolidated taxation system as part of the Ferrovial, S.A. Group. During 2009 and as a consequence of the
purchase-sale transaction performed, the Group left the aforementioned tax status, and as of 31 December 2009 the
Company requested taxation as a fiscal group, effective 1 January 2010. This group comprises the following
companies:

- Empark, Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A.

- Dornier, S.A.U.

- Femet, S.A.

- Guadianapark, S.A.

- Balsol 2001, S.A.

- Estacionamientos Guipuzcoanos, S.L.U.


-----

- Empark Aparcamientos Extremadura, S.L.

**_Current income tax_**

Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current period are measured at the amount expected to be recovered
from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are
enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

Current income tax relating to items F-24ecognized directly in equity is F-24ecognized in equity and not in the income
statement. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in which
applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate.

**_Deferred tax_**

Deferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and
liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes at the reporting date.

Deferred tax liabilities are F-24ecognized for all taxable temporary differences, except:

- When the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction
that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor
taxable profit or loss.

- In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in
joint ventures, when the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that
the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Deferred tax assets are F-24ecognized for all deductible temporary differences, the carry forward of unused tax
credits and any unused tax losses. Deferred tax assets are F-24ecognized to the extent that it is probable that taxable
profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits
and unused tax losses can be F-24ecogniz, except:

- When the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an
asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects
neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss

- In respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests
in joint ventures, deferred tax assets are F-24ecognized only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary
differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary
differences can be F-24ecogniz

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no
longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be
F-24ecogniz. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and are F-24ecognized to the
extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset
is F-24ecogniz or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively
enacted at the reporting date.

Deferred tax relating to items F-24ecognized outside profit or loss is F-24ecognized outside profit or loss. Deferred tax
items are F-24ecognized in correlation to the underlying transaction either in other comprehensive income or directly
in equity.

Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets
against current income tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation
authority.


-----

Tax benefits acquired as part of a business combination, but not satisfying the criteria for separate recognition at that
date, are F-25ecognized subsequently if new information about facts and circumstances change. The adjustment is
either treated as a reduction to goodwill (as long as it does not exceed goodwill) if it was incurred during the
measurement period or F-25ecognized in profit or loss.

_2.9.16 Foreign currency transactions conversion_

The financial statements of companies in foreign currency have been converted to Euros using the closing exchange
and average rate method in accordance with the following rates:

**January-September** **September** **January-September**

**2013** **2013** **2012**

**Exchange Rate** **Average** **Closing** **Average**

**Euro/Pound Sterling** ............................................................... 0.852 0.836 0.812

**Euro/Turkish Lira** ................................................................ 2.459 2.751 3.309

_2.9.17 Recognition of revenue_

Revenue is F-25ecognized to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the
revenue can be reliably measured, regardless of when the payment is being made. Revenue is measured at the fair
value of the consideration received or receivable, taking into account contractually defined terms of payment and
excluding taxes or duty. The Group assesses its revenue arrangements against specific criteria to determine if it is
acting as principal or agent. The Group has concluded that it is acting as a principal in all of its revenue arrangements.
The specific recognition criteria described below must also be met before revenue is F-25ecognized.

The Group F-25ecognized revenue when the amount can be reliably valued, future earnings are probable and certain
specific conditions are met for each activity as set forth below. It is considered that a reliable estimate of the value of
the income cannot be made until all contingencies associated with the sale have been settled. The Group bases its
estimate on historical result, taking the type of client, the type of transaction and the specific terms of each agreement
into account.

a) The car park business may be divided into:

a.1) Off-street and mixed parking

a.2) Regulated on-street car parks (ORA)

a.3) Car parks for local residents

a.1) Off-street and mixed parking

Off-street parking revenues are registered on sale of the parking voucher, and on an accrual basis in the case of
reserved parking spaces. Mixed car parks (with public and private spaces) record revenues as follows: in the case of
public spaces, in the manner described in the preceding paragraph; and in case of private spaces, the amount
received is recorded in the income statement at the time of the transfer of concession usage of the corresponding
parking spaces.

The cost of residential parking spaces is registered in inventories and entered to the income statement on the transfer
date of assignment of use.

a.2) Regulated on-street parking (ORA)

Revenue from the ORA regulated limited time parking service derives from the cost of providing the service plus a
percentage, generally between 1% and 3%, of the difference between service cost and the funds collected. In some
ORA contracts revenue is earned at a fixed rate (service cost) which is independent of the funds collected (these
belong to the City Council). This is registered in the accounts on provision of the service.

a.3) Car parks for local residents

This business involves the construction of car parks whose spaces are sold directly to the end customer during the
term of the concession. The sales and costs are not registered until the parking space is delivered, which tends to
coincide with signature of the contract, or exceptionally, the public deed of sale.

_2.10.18 Leases_

The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at
the inception date. The arrangement is assessed for whether F-26ecognizedF-26 of the arrangement is dependent on
the use of a specific asset or assets or the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset or assets, even if that right is
not explicitly specified in an arrangement.

**_Group as a lessee_**

Finance leases that transfer substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item to the
Group, are F-26ecognizedF-26 at the commencement of the lease at the fair value of the leased property or, if lower,
at the present value of the minimum lease payments. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and
reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are F-26ecognized in finance costs in the income statement.

A leased asset is depreciated over the useful life of the asset. However, if there is no reasonable certainty that the
Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term, the asset is depreciated over the shorter of the estimated
useful life of the asset and the lease term.

Operating lease payments are F-26ecognized as an operating expense in the income statement on a straight-line
basis over the lease term.

**_Group as a lessor_**

Leases in which the Group does not transfer substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of an asset are
classified as operating leases. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating an operating lease are added to the carrying
amount of the leased asset and F-26ecognized over the lease term on the same basis as rental income. Contingent
rents are F-26ecognized as revenue in the period in which they are earned.

_2.9.19 Operating seasonality_

Net turnover and Group profits are not significantly influenced by operating seasonality.

**3 Management of financial risks and capital**

The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including exchange rate risk, interest rate
risk and price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.

Risk management is carried out by the Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A. Financial Directorate General which
identifies, assesses and hedges financial risks in accordance with the policies approved by the Board of Directors.
The Board provides policies for comprehensive risk management and for specific areas such as exchange rate risk,
interest rate risk, liquidity risk, use of derivative and non-derivative instruments and investment of surplus liquidity.

The financial risks to which the Company is exposed include those deriving from guarantees and sureties required in
order for the company to undertake its activities.

During the 2012 financial year and the nine month period ended 30 September 2013, the Company maintained bank
guarantees with third parties and guarantee commitments with other Group companies in order to engage in its
business.

**_Market risk: Exchange rate risk_**

Management has established an exchange rate risk management policy for foreign currencies in relation to the
working currency. The Treasury Department negotiates forward contracts in order to manage exchange rate risks
deriving from future commercial transactions and F-26ecognized assets and liabilities. Exchange rate risk arises
where future commercial transactions or F-26ecognized assets or liabilities are quoted in a currency other than the
F-26ecognizedF-26i’s functional currency.

The board of directors considers that there are not significant impacts on the interim condensed consolidated financial
statements, by this risk.

**_Market risk: Cash flow interest rate risk and fair value risk_**

As of 30 September 2013, if interest rates on external resources quoted in Euros had been 50 base points
higher/lower, with all other variables remaining constant, the result after taxes for the period would have been


-----

variable rate loans.

The Group carries out the corresponding interest rate hedges by contacting an IRS (Interest Rate Swap). (Note 14).

As of 30 September 2013 58 % of the total debt balance is hedged by these instruments.

The board of directors considers that there are not significant impacts on the interim condensed consolidated financial
statements, by this risk.

**_Credit risk_**

Credit risk is managed by groups. Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents and deposits held in banks and
financial institutions and wholesale and retail clients including pending accounts receivable and committed
transactions. The Group only deals with credit institutions of F-27ecognized prestige and solvency.

The board of directors considers that there are not significant impacts on the interim condensed consolidated financial
statements, by this risk.

**_Liquidity risk_**

Prudent management of liquidity risk involves holding sufficient cash and tradable securities, having access to finance
through sufficient agreed credit facilities and having the capacity to unwind market positions. Given the dynamic
nature of the underlying businesses, the object of the Group’s Treasury Department is to maintain financing flexibility
by the availability of credit lines.

The board of directors considers that there are not significant impacts on the interim condensed consolidated financial
statements, by this risk.

**144,597** **144,763**

**_Impairment tests_**

The Group performs a procedure with the purpose of identifying any possible deficit in the carrying cost with regard to
the recoverable value of goodwill.

Possible impairment is calculated by comparing the value of these assets with their fair value, the latter understood as
the value of future cash flows it is estimated the assets will generate based on objective hypotheses and discounted at
an estimated capital cost based on the risk-free rate using the 30-year bond, the risk level of the asset and estimated
market premium as the yardstick.

Additionally, residual value is calculated incorporating renewal of contracts and growth.

In order to establish the present value of the future cash flows derived from the investment, the following hypotheses
were applied:

- It was established that the corresponding investment will generate flows over the periods up to maturity, of between
5 and 50 years depending on the concession.

- The corresponding revenue and expenditure forecasts were performed, in accordance with the following general
criteria:

    - In the case of revenue, in order to estimate the evolution of rates consideration was given to the official
forecast for the evolution of the consumer price index (CPI) in each of the countries where the investments
are operational (2.5% in both Spain and Portugal), the corresponding formulae for the adjustment of rates as
set out in the concession contracts, on the basis of the evolution of price indices and/or any specific correction
factors which may apply.

In the case of new contracts consideration was given to a ramp up in demand over the first 2-5 years of the
concession in accordance with a specific analysis of each contract, followed by an estimate of evolution of
revenue similar to previous rates.

    - In terms of expenditure, the evolution thereof was calculated on the basis of the corresponding expected
evolution in the CPI rates (2.5% in both Spain and Portugal), in addition to the forecast evolution of the
business.

    - Consideration was also given to the impact of works to be performed in order to maintain and improve
infrastructure, based on the best estimate available according to the company’s experience, and taking into
consideration the forecast evolution of the business.

    - Consideration was given to the future costs and revenue corresponding to renewals of contracts and also the
investments required for these renewals on the basis of the investments occurring on previous contracts.


-----

were estimated at between 75% and 85%, based on the actual rates obtained by the Group.

    - The forecast cash flows obtained on the basis of the projected revenue and expenditure, in accordance with
the aforementioned criteria, were updated at the discount rate resulting from adding to the long-term cost of
money the risk premium assigned by the market to the country where the company performs its operations,
the risk premium assigned by the market to each business (both based on a long-term vision), along with the
financial Company and group companies of the company or cash-generating unit in question. The discount
rate employed was 8.24 %.

As a result of the impairment test performed, it has been revealed that the various cash-generating units to which the
various recorded sums of goodwill are assigned will serve to recover the net value of each of the sums recorded by
30 September 2013, and there is therefore no need to establish any form of impairment provision.

A sensitivity analysis was also performed regarding reasonably possible changes in the key valuation variables (CPI,
inflation, discount rate, renewals…) with the recoverable value being maintained above the net book value.

Parqueamentos, S.A., Esli, Gisparques, and SP Gis – Planeamiento e Gestao de Estacionamento, S.A. has a
syndicated loan signed on 27 July 2009, in the sum of 400,343 thousands of Euros. Of these 400,343 thousands of
Euros, 18,680 thousands of Euros were not drawn because funding was obtained for Concha Parking, S.A. through
Project Finance. 406 thousands of Euros of financing for Balsol 2001, S.A. were likewise not drawn.

On 14 October 2010 the agreement was renewed and extended by 42,000 thousands of Euros, the sum drawn down
as of 31 December 2012 being 40,794 thousands of Euros.

In April 2012 a prepayment of 330 thousands of Euros was made.

The credit limit granted at 30 September 2013 is 423,257 thousands of Euros.

On 18 December 2012 Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A., pigned a novation modifying without terminating the
syndicated loan. This novation involved a change to the F-36ecognizedF-36i calendar of all the facilities, without any
change to the nominal rate of the various facilities, or the spreads, or the maturity dates (the same conditions as under
the previous financing arrangement were maintained).

The costs associated with the novation of this loan were 3,320 thousands of Euros, considered as an amortised cost.
The cost was 75 basis points applied to the sum of the loan.

A comprehensive analysis of the new loan has been performed, essentially comprising:

- Calculation of the net present value of the previous financing and the new arrangement, based on the
corresponding drawdowns and F-36ecognizedF-36io (in the case of the new F-36ecognizedF-36i calendar, the cost
of 3,320 thousands of Euros was likewise taken into consideration), applying the weighted mean discount rate for
this financing.

The discount rate employed was 6.67 %.

- The result of the study was a variation between the value of the previous and new financing arrangements of
0.46%.

Therefore, following the analysis carried out it has been determined that there is no substantial change in the loan
conditions, and therefore the cost associated with the renewal has been calculated as an amortised cost to be spread
over the remaining life of the loan.

This syndicated loan is pegged to the Euribor with a differential of between 3.5% and 4.5%: Facility A at 4%, Facility B
at 4.5%, TC1 at 4% and TC2 at 3.5% (see table below).

The total amount is divided into three different loans:

Facility A is an amortising loan payment of which began in 2011, and will expire in 2016. Under the new
F-36ecognizedF-36i calendar, aside from the half-yearly F-36ecognizedF-36io, there are three major
F-36ecognizedF-36io in December 2013, June 2015 and July 2016, the definitive maturity date.

Facility B was initially a bullet loan, with the sum total of the loan being amortised on maturity, in 2017. However,
following signature of the loan novation, F-36ecognizedF-36io were established in December 2013 and June 2015,
with a final F-36ecognizedF-36i in July 2017.

With regard to borrowing for Capex, this is divided into TC1 and TC2, and the total sum stands at 72,000 thousands of
Euros, which may be drawn down in order to pay for investments. As of 30 September 2013, 30,000 thousands of
Euros of TC1 and 42,000 thousands of Euros of TC2 had been drawn.

TC1 was initially an amortising-type loan with half-yearly F-36ecognizedF-36io, maturing in July 2016. It now has three
single F-36ecognizedF-36io in December 2013, June 2015 and one final F-36ecognizedF-36i in July 2016.

_1 – Income generated from off-street car parks_

Revenue from off-street short-stay car parks corresponds to revenues generated through the use of parking spaces
owned by the Group or held under an administrative concession. Off-street car park revenues are recorded when the
hourly parking rate is paid and, in the case of season ticket-holders, on an accrual basis.

_2 – Revenue generated through the sale of residents parking spaces_

This business involves the construction of car parks whose spaces are sold directly to the end customer during the
term of the concession. The sales and costs are not registered until the parking space is delivered, which coincides
with the signature of the contract.

_3 – Revenue generated by on-street car parks (ORA)_

Revenue from the ORA regulated limited time parking service derives from the cost of providing the service plus a
percentage, generally between 1% and 3%, of the difference between service cost and the funds collected. In some
ORA contracts revenue is earned at a fixed rate (service cost) which is independent of the funds collected (these
belong to the City Council). This is registered in the accounts on provision of the service.

_4 – Management and others_

The Group also F-44ecognizedF-44 in the provision of other services associated with the comprehensive
management of parking and urban and interurban mobility such as: management of parking facilities in ports and
airports, access control to nature reserves, temporary parking services for trade fairs and other mass attendance
events, park and ride combined services, etc.

1.– Major claim by Obrascon Huarte Laín, S.A. against Ferrovial Aparcamientos, S.A. (now Empark Aparcamientos y
Servicios, S.A.), Vista Desarrollo, S.A., Caixa Penedés, CARIPLO and Bolsa de Madrid requesting the annulment of
the enforcement proceeding against secured collateral affecting 850,614 ESSA shares (now Empark Aparcamientos y
Servicios, S.A.).

A judgement in favour of Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A. and other defendants was handed down by the
Supreme Court on 10 December 2008. These proceedings may now be considered closed. As the plaintiff was
ordered to pay the court fees, Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A. submitted three requests for Calculation of
Court Fees, by which a claim is made against Obrascón Huarte Laín, S.A. (OHL) for the payment of Court
Representative and Barrister fees. The costs relating to these three proceedings have already been collected. Finally,
the Supreme Court costs were set by the Order of 22 January 2013 and amounted to 43 thousands of Euros for
barristers’ fees, and 26 thousands of Euros for court representatives’ fees.

Furthermore, Counsel Félix López Antón Esq., who handled the defence of Empark’s interests in the various
instances of this proceeding, filed three Jura de Cuentas (collection of legal fees) proceedings against Empark, for the
payment of fees incurred for the Court of First Instance, the Provincial High Court and the Supreme Court. The current
situation of these proceedings is as follows:

- First Instance: Legal fees were set by the Court at 117 thousands of Euros (plus VAT) from which 54 thousands
(plus VAT) must be deducted for fees already paid by Empark to the Lawyer. The amount pending payment was
thus 63 thousands of Euros (plus VAT), which was deposited with the Court on 17 September 2010. The interest
has also been paid, at 3 thousands of Euros. The Court costs for the Jura de Cuentas proceeding remain to be
calculated.

Counsel Anton Lopez solicited testimony from various writings and judgements in this claim, possibly in order to
bring them before the relevant competent courts in any future legal action that Despacho López Antón SLP might
take against Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A., said testimonies were issued by Court Order of 10 October
2011.

- Provincial Court: The fees accrued in the High Court were initially set by said Court at 31 thousands of Euros (incl.
VAT), of which Empark had already paid 8 thousands of Euros. However, the lawyer charging the fees requested
annulment of this ruling, arguing that there had been an evident error in applying the Standard Fees scale of the
Madrid Bar Association. Said nullity was allowed by the Court and fees were finally set at 47 thousands of Euros
(plus VAT), from which 8 thousands of Euros shall be deducted, leaving 39 thousands of Euros (plus VAT). The full
sum owed has now been deposited, and the VAT was paid out of court upon the presentation of the corresponding
invoice. The Court costs have not been set.

Counsel Anton Lopez solicited testimony from various writings and judgements in this remedy, citing that “they
would be brought before the relevant competent courts in any future legal action that Despacho López Antón SLP
might take against Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A.” Said testimonies were issued by Court Order of
11 October 2011.

- Supreme Court: The fees were set by the Supreme Court at 43,640 thousands of Euros (incl. VAT), from which the
10 thousands of Euros already paid by Empark is to be deducted. The remaining sum of 33 thousands of Euros has
been deposited by Empark. The Lawyer charging the fees requested the nullification of this ruling, which was not
granted by the Supreme Court, a decision about which he again requested clarification, a request that was also
dismissed by Order of 12 July 2011.

Despacho López Antón Abogados SLP has also filed an ordinary lawsuit, based on the fees incurred in the
proceedings of previous Jura de Cuentas, for: (i) the outstanding portion of the fees incurred in the extraordinary
legal remedies for procedural infringement and cassation Nº 2901/2003, which were not included in the Jura de
Cuentas docket, F-49ecogniz 137 thousands of Euros (plus VAT) and 15 thousands of Euros of accrued penalty
interest, without prejudice to any interest that may continue to accrue until the payment of the debt; (ii) the accrued
penalty interest not F-49ecognized by the Madrid Provincial Court, for the fees included in the Jura de Cuentas
docket, F-49ecogniz 2 thousands of Euros. EMPARK was notified of the lawsuit on 28 December 2011 and
answered on 26 January 2012. The Preliminary Hearing was held on 4 June 2012, and the trial on 5 November
2012. The sentence was handed down on 4 December 2012, in which the suit brought by Despacho López Antón
Abogados, S.L.P. was dismissed and the latter ordered to pay all legal costs.

On 22 January 2013 Despacho López Antón Abogados, S.L.P. filed an appeal before the Provincial Court of Madrid.
Days later we filed notice of opposition to the appeal. Pending judgement on appeal.

 Management report for the nine-month period ended on 30 September 2013

**Economic activity for the financial year**

During the first nine-months of 2013 the company carried on business in a difficult financial and economic
environment due to the persistent worldwide recession. This recession has caused a significant decrease in economic
and financial activity which has also been noticed in Spain and Portugal, the group’s main markets.

In spite of this slump the performance of the Empark Group has been very positive, showing considerable resistance
and excellent management capacity, which has enabled us to obtain a recurring EBITDA in the first nine months of
2013 of 46,421 thousands of Euros.

The group leads the Spanish and Portuguese car parking markets and has been involved in the construction,
management and operation of underground as well as on-street parking since 1968.

It has succeeded in developing the activities required to provide optimal integrated vehicle management services in
any environment. Proof of this is the fact that the Group and its subsidiaries managed more than 396,436 parking
spaces in Spain, Portugal, Andorra, United Kingdom and Turkey.

Its presence in the industry includes all lines of business:

**_a) Off-street parking_**

The Group designs, builds and operates all manner of off-street parking within any context and employing any
formula. The most significant are:

experience throughout every region of Spain and Portugal.

country’s main cities.

for local residents.

**_b) On-Street parking_**

market leader in Spain and Portugal.

Employing the latest technology and drawing on the support of a powerful F-53ecognizedF-53i, the Group provides

**Financial Information**

Net turnover amounted to 132,650 thousands of Euros in the first nine months of 2013 and 136,028 thousands of
Euros in the first nine months of 2012, which represents a reduction of (2.48)%.

Operating profits stood at 24,099 thousands of Euros in the first nine months of 2013, representing 18.17% of net
turnover.

The consolidated results, before tax, amounted to (2,872) thousands of Euros for the first nine months of 2013.

The Group’s average workforce as of 30 September 2013 is made up of 2,840 employees of whom 37% are women

The Company’s financial risk management policy is based on Group management of capital in order to guarantee that
it will be in a position to continue operating as a profitable business while F-54ecognized shareholder return by striking
an optimum balance between debt and equity.

The main risks to which the Group is exposed are set forth below:

- Liquidity risk: Within its general policy the Group identifies treasury need using two tools: treasury budget with a 12
month horizon with monthly update breakdown, and treasury budget with a 30-day horizon, with daily update
breakdowns. These tools identify treasury needs in volume and time, and plan new financing needs.

- Credit risk: the Group maintains cash and equivalent liquid assets at financial institutions with a high-level credit
rating. It should furthermore be mentioned that there is no significant concentration of credit risk with third parties.

- Interest rate risk: interest-rate risk affects the Group essentially through long-term external resources. The Group
has contracted financial instruments that partially cover the risk of possible interest rate hikes.

- Exchange rate risk: The Group has no significant exchange rate risk as most of its assets and liabilities, revenue
and expenses, are quoted in Euros.

**Subsequent events**

There are no relevant events to point out.

**Research and development**

The Group has not carried out any research and development activities.


-----

There have been no acquisitions of own shares.

**Derivatives**

The Group has contracted financial instruments that partially cover the risk of possible interest rate hikes of long-term
outside resources.

**Environmental aspects**

Environmental activities are understood as covering any operation the main purpose of which is to prevent, reduce or
repair damage to the environment.

The investments derived from environmental activities are valued at the acquisition cost and are activated as greater
fixed asset expenses in the financial year in which they are incurred, following the criteria described in note 2
regarding applicable accounting standards.

Costs derived from the protection and improvements of the environment are attributed to the results for the financial
year in which they are incurred, irrespective of the point when the monetary or financial flow derived there from
occurs.

The provisions relative to probable or certain responsibilities, legal proceedings in process and for compensation and
pending obligations of an undetermined amount, of an environmental nature not covered by contracted insurance
policies, are made when the liability or the obligation establishing the compensation becomes effective.

As of 3 September 2013, the costs or expenses incurred with regard to environmental aspects are insignificant.

As for any such potential contingencies as may arise in the field of the environment, the directors do not believe that
they would have any significant impact on the enclosed annual accounts.

**_1.2 Changes in the scope_**



- The main change in the scope of consolidation between the nine-month period ending 30 September 2011 and
30 September 2012 is:

During the last four months of 2011 the group sold the holding that Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A. had in
Estacionamientos y Servicios Extremeños, S.A.; the value of the holding was 90 thousand of Euros; it was sold for a
sum of 330 thousand of Euros generating a profit of 240 thousand of Euros.


-----

On 18 January 2012, the sole shareholder, Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A., created the trading company
Empark Aparcamientos Extremadura, S.L. The company has declared the commencement of operations; however, it
does not currently hold any concession.

In early 2012, the sole shareholder, Empark Portugal – Empreendimentos e Exploraçao de Parqueamentos, S.A.,
created the trading company Segempark, S.A. The company has declared the commencement of operations;
however, it does not currently hold any concession.

During the first nine months of 2012 the group dissolved UTE Aparcamientos; the value of the holding was 3 thousand
of Euros.

**2 Summary of the main accounting policies**

**_2.1 Basis of presentations and reporting standards_**

The consolidated financial information presented in these financial statements has been drawn up using the
International Financial Reporting Standards adopted by the European Union (IFRS-EU). Regarding the methods used
to apply these regulations, it is worth mentioning that in the circumstances in which the IFRS-EU permits various
alternative criteria, the Group has opted to value tangible fixed assets and intangible assets at historical cost,
capitalizing financial costs during the construction period, and in the case of jointly controlled companies and joint
ventures with existing companies, to consolidate the same using the proportionate consolidation method. The Interim
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared using the historical cost approach amended by
revaluations of derivatives. Said criteria were the same as applied in the 2011 financial year.

The interim condensed consolidated financial statements do not contain all the information and breakdowns required
for annual financial reporting and thus must be read together with the consolidated financial statements for the year
ended 31 December 2011 drawn up in compliance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
currently applicable in the European Union.

The Group applied the IFRS-EU to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the first time in financial year 2009.

**_2.2 Accounting standards applied_**

_a) Standards and interpretations adopted by the European Union applicable in this period._

The accounting policies applied on drawing up the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the ninemonth period ending 30 September 2012 are the same as those applied in the consolidated financial statements for
the financial year ended 31 December 2011, except for the following amendment that is applicable to the financial
years beginning from 1 January 2012:

- Amendment to IFRS 7 “Disclosures – Transfer of financial assets”: The IASB published amendments to IFRS 7 to
enhance disclosures on financial assets that have been transferred (as defined in IAS 39). If the transferred assets
are not F-67ecognizedF-67i in their entirety in the consolidated financial statements the entity should break down
the information to help users of financial statements to understand the relationship between the transferred financial
assets and the associated liabilities. If the assets have been F-67ecognizedF-67i in their entirety but the entity
continues to have an ongoing involvement, the disclosures must enable the user to assess the nature and risks
deriving from the entity’s ongoing involvement in the F-67ecognizedF-67i assets. These amendments are
applicable to financial years beginning on or after 1 July 2011 and do not include requirements for comparative
information. Application of this amendment has had no impact on the Group’s accounting policies, financial position
or performance.

_b) Standards and interpretations issued by the IASB and adopted by the European Union, but not applicable in this_
_period_

As of the publication of these Consolidated Financial Statements, the following standards, changes and interpretation
have been published by the IASB and approved by the European Union but their application is not mandatory:

- Amendment to IAS 1 “Presentation of items of another comprehensive result”: The amendments to IAS 1 change
the grouping of the items presented in another comprehensive result. The items that could be reclassified (or
“recycled”) to the income statement at some future time shall be presented separately from the items that will never
be reclassified. The amendment only affects presentation and has no impact either on the financial situation or the
Group’s profit or loss. These amendments are applicable to financial years starting from 1 July 2012.

- IAS 19 revised, “Employee Benefits”: Amendments include both fundamental changes and deletion of the corridor
method and the concept of expected yield of the assets allocated to the plan, and simple declarations and review of
wording. The Group made a voluntary change in its accounting policy to F-67ecognize actuarial profit and loss in


-----

expenditure, as the expected return on the assets associated with the plan will be calculated using the same
interest rate as applied to calculate the services charge. These amendments are applicable to financial years
starting from 01 January 2013.

- The Group is currently assessing the impact of applying these standards and amendments. Based on analyses
performed to date the Group believes that implementation of these rules and amendments will not have a
significant impact on the consolidated financial statements in the initial application period.

_c) Standards and interpretations issued by the IASB and in force but not yet approved by the European Union._

- At the date of issue of these financial statements the following standard and amendment had been published by the
IASB. Application was mandatory according to IASB requirements and it had not been approved by the European
Union:

- Amendment to IAS 12 “Deferred tax: recovery of underlying assets”: The amendment clarifies the calculation of
deferred taxes on property investments recorded at the fair value and introduces the presumption that the deferred
taxes on property investments using the fair value model described in IAS 40 should be determined on the basis
that their book value will be recovered by the sale. Additionally, it introduces the requirement for deferred taxes on
non-depreciable taxes that are valued using the revaluation method described in IAS 16 are always calculated on
the basis of the sale of said assets. This amendment is applicable to annual periods beginning on or after
1 January 2012.

- The Group is currently assessing the impact of the application of this rule and amendment. Based on analyses
performed to date the Group believes that implementation of these rules and amendments will not have a
significant impact on the consolidated financial statements in the initial application period.

_d) Standards and interpretations issued by the IASB but not yet approved by the European Union._

- At the date of issue of these financial statements the following standards and amendments had been published by
the IASB. Application was not mandatory and they had not been approved by the European Union:

- IFRS 9 “Financial instruments”: Applicable to financial years starting from 01 January 2015 for IASB.

- IFRS 10 “Consolidated Financial Statements”: IFRS 10 establishes a single audit model applied to all entities,
including entities with a special purpose. The changes introduced by IFRS 10 will require Senior Management to
make substantial judgements in establishing which companies are controlled, and must therefore be consolidated
by the Dominant Company, in comparison with the requirements which would be set out in IAS 27. In accordance
with the preliminary analysis performed, IFRS 10 is not expected to have any impact on the investments currently
held by the Group. IFRS 10 is applicable to financial years starting from 01 January 2013.

- IFRS 11 “Joint Agreements”: IFRS 11 eliminates the option of entering controlled companies into the accounts
jointly using the proportionate consolidation method. In turn, jointly-controlled companies, which adjust to the
definition of joint entity, must be entered into the accounts using the equity method. The Group is currently
assessing the impact this new standard will have on the Group’s financial situation and results, but on the basis of
the preliminary analysis significant impacts are not expected. IFRS 11 is applicable to financial years starting from
01 January 2013.

- IFRS 12 “Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities”: IFRS 12 includes the disclosures previously listed under IAS 27
regarding the consolidated management report, in addition to all disclosures previously included in IAS 31 and IAS
28. These disclosures refer to stakes in dependent companies, joint agreements, associated entities and structured
entities. It also requires new additional disclosures, but will have no impact on the Group’s financial position or
results. This standard will take effect for the financial years starting 1 January 2013.

- IFRS 13 “Measurement of Fair Value”: IFRS 13 establishes a single guideline for all fair value assessments in
accordance with the IFRS. The IFRS 13 does not change when the use of the fair value is required, but offers a
guideline on how to determine the fair value in accordance with the IFRS when required or permitted. The Group is
currently assessing the impact this new standard will have on the Group’s financial situation and results, but on the
basis of the preliminary analysis significant impacts are not expected. This standard will take effect for the financial
years starting 1 January 2013.

- Revised IAS 27 “Separate Financial Statements”. applicable to financial years beginning as of 01 January 2013.

- IAS 28 revised, “Investment in Associates and Joint Ventures”: It now also describes the application of the equity
method to investments in joint businesses, in addition to associated entities. This amendment will take effect for the
financial years starting from 01 January 2013.

- IFRIC 20 “Excavation costs in production phase of surface mine”: This interpretation applies to the costs of
removing waste (excavation) incurred during the production phase of an open air mine. The interpretation
establishes that profits from excavation activity will be recorded in the accounts. The interpretation takes effect for


-----

Group.

- Amendment to IAS 32 “Offsetting financial assets with financial liabilities”: These changes clarify the meaning of
“when there is an applicable legal right to offset”. These amendments also clarify application of the offsetting criteria
of cancellation systems (such as F-69ecognizedF-69 cash systems), which apply offsetting mechanisms using
gross values for items which do not arise simultaneously. These amendments are not expected to have any impact
on the financial position or profit or loss of the Group and will be effective for the financial years starting from
1 January 2014.

- Amendment to IFRS 7 “Offsetting financial assets with financial liabilities”: These amendments require that
information is disclosed on offsetting rights and similar agreements (e.g. collateral agreements). Disclosures will
provide useful information to users to assess the effect of presenting these agreements at net values in the entity’s
financial position. The new disclosures are mandatory for all those financial instruments offset in accordance with
the terms of IAS 32. These modifications are not expected to have any form of impact on the financial situation or
results of the Group, and will take effect for financial years beginning as of 1 January 2013.

- Improvements to IFRS: applicable to financial years beginning as of 01 January 2013.

- The Group is currently assessing the impact of applying these standards and amendments. Based on analyses
performed to date the Group believes that implementation of these standards and amendments will not have a
significant impact on the consolidated financial statements in the initial application period.

Consolidated Statements of Financial Situation.

In accordance with legal and accounting standards and the procedures agreed for these abridged interim consolidated
financial statements, the directors present the figures at December 31, 2011 in addition to those at September 30,
2012 for comparative purposes with each item of the associated accounts.

Consolidated Income Statements, Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Statements of
Changes in Net Equity and Consolidated Cash Flow Statements.

In compliance with accounting and legal regulations and with the procedures applicable to these Interim Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements, the directors present, for comparative purposes, with each item of the
Consolidated Statements of Income, Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Statements
of Changes in Net Equity and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow, the figures for the nine-month period ending
30 September 2012 in addition to those for the nine-month period ending 30 September 2011.

**_2.5 Company operating with negative working capital_**

As of 30 September 2012 the Group reports a negative working capital of (27,796) thousand of Euros and as at
31 December 2011 (8,171) thousand of Euros. This circumstance, which could be indicative of uncertainty regarding
continuation of the Group, is mitigated by the fact that these types of situation are common in groups such as the
present where a large part of turnover is collected in cash.

Additionally, the Group operates a cash-pooling system by which Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A. manages
treasury requirements at Group level.


-----

Therefore, the Board of Directors considers that the operating company principle is the appropriate basis for
preparation of these Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. This entails realization of assets and
liquidation of liabilities in accordance with the amounts and classification criteria set forth said interim condensed
consolidated financial statements.

**_2.6 Accounting estimates and assumptions_**

These Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contain estimates made by the directors of the
Controlling Company and consolidated companies to quantify some of the assets, liabilities, income, expenses and
commitments shown in said statements. Basically, these estimates refer to:

- Evaluation of potential losses due to impairment of certain assets.

- Useful life of tangible and intangible assets.

- Estimates related to the fair value of assets purchased in business combinations and goodwill.

- Assessment of possible contingencies due to legal and tax risks.

These estimates were made on the basis of the best information available on 30 September 2012 and 31 December
2011 concerning the facts analysed. Nevertheless, it is possible that events which may take place in the future will
require that they are amended, which would, where applicable, be done in accordance with the provisions of IAS 8.

**_2.7 Resource management policies_**

The Group manages its investments after having performed thorough inspection and assessment of potentially
attractive projects from the environmental, socio-occupational, commercial, financial and economic perspectives, for
the purpose of achieving a sustainable and balanced growth.

In carrying out this task, the Group’s shareholders seek a balanced position regarding expected investment profits and
the risk assumed.

**_2.8 Consolidation criteria_**

As of 30 September 2012 the Group closed the accounting period for presentation of the individual financial
statements of all group companies included within the consolidation scope at the same date. Likewise, for the purpose
of uniformity in the presentation of items comprising these Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements,
uniform accounting criteria has been applied on the basis of the Controlling Company’s accounting policies. These
Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been drawn up on the basis of the following methods:

**a.** **Full consolidation method: All companies considered subsidiaries are fully consolidated. For these purposes,**
subsidiaries are those companies in which Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A. maintains effective control
because it directly or indirectly, by means of agreements with other shareholders, holds more than 50% of the
voting rights. In assessing whether the Group controls another F-70ecognizedF-70i, consideration is given to the
existence and impact of currently exercisable or convertible potential voting rights. Inclusion within the scope of
consolidation of the Group is carried out from the time at which control of the subsidiary becomes effective. The
value of shares held by minority shareholders in equity and in the result of the financial year of fully consolidated
subsidiaries is listed in chapters “Minority interests” of the Consolidated Statements of Financial Situation and
“Result attributed to minority interests” of the consolidated income statement.

**b.** **Equity method: Companies considered to constitute associates are consolidated by the equity method. For**
these purposes, associate companies are defined as all those in which the Group has significant influence over
management but does not exercise control or joint management with third parties. Under the equity method, the
percentage of equity held in the associate company with reference to both net equity and the result of the year is
F-70ecognized.

**c.** **Proportionate consolidation method: Applied to joint ventures, which are businesses in which management of**
subsidiaries is carried out jointly under contract by the controlling company and by third parties not related to the
Group. Assets and liabilities assigned to joint ventures or those jointly controlled with other parties are reported
in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position classified in accordance with the specific nature of the
holding as defined by percentage. Likewise, income and expenditure arising from joint ventures are recognized
in the Consolidated profit and loss account, also in accordance the nature of the holding as defined by
percentage.

**d.** **Balances and transactions with Group companies: Balances and transactions with Group companies are**
written off in the consolidation process.


-----

subsidiaries and joint ventures whose accounting records are in a currency other than the Euro are converted to
Euros by applying the end of period exchange rates to all assets and liabilities except equity, which is converted
using the rate at the time the item was included in the group. Within the consolidation process shares held in
group companies are written off against shareholder equity, except in associated companies, which are
converted at the closing rate.

Result is converted to Euros at the average exchange rate for the year. Differences arising during the conversion
process are entered to shareholder equity as “currency exchange rate differences”.

_a) Subsidiaries_

The acquisition cost method is used to determine the book value of newly acquired subsidiaries. The cost of
acquisition is the fair value of the assets handed over, the asset instruments shared and liabilities incurred or assumed
on the date of exchange, the fair value of any additional consideration dependent on future events (provided that
these are probable and can be reliably valued) plus the costs that can be directly attributed to the acquisition.

When control is acquired in phases, the goodwill (or negative consolidation difference) is determined in each of the
individual transactions, and the difference between the book value of the interests and the net value attributable to the
holding of the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities incurred, as they exist on said date. Identifiable assets
and liabilities incurred are incorporated on the basis of the fair value that exists at the time control is acquired. The
minority interests item should show the value resulting from their interests in the equity.

The difference between the net value attributable to the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired and existing on
the date control is acquired and that on each of the dates on which the interests were acquired, leads to adjustments
of the Group’s reserves, shown net of any tax effect.

In early 2012 Empark Aparcamientos Extremadura, S.L. and Segempark, S.A. were incorporated.

_b) Associate companies_

When the equity method procedure is first applied, investments in associated companies are valued at the amount
corresponding to the percentage represented by the holding at the time of the investment, based on the fair value of
the assets acquired and liabilities incurred. If the resulting difference between the cost of the holding and this value is
positive it is included in the book value of the investment. If negative, the difference is shown directly in the
consolidated income statement.

Any variations not involving third parties occurring during the current financial year in Group net equity included in the
consolidated financial statements under the equity method proportionately increase or reduce, as applicable, the book
value of the holding in question once any F-71ecognizedF-71i and impairment occurring since the method was applied
for the first time are taken into account, and after elimination of the proportion based on results of transactions
between the aforesaid company and the company holding the interest, or any other group company.

Profits distributed by the associate companies, reduce the book value of the stake.

Temporary evaluative homogeneity is applied to associated investments in the same way as for subsidiaries.

_c) TJVs (Temporary Joint Ventures) and Companies as Joint Ventures_

Non-realised results, deriving from reciprocal transactions, are written off in proportion to the stake, in addition to the
amounts of reciprocal assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and cash flows.

- In May 2012 the Ute Aparcamientos was dissolved.

**_2.9 Principal measurement rules applying to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements._**

The main valuation standards and accounting criteria used in drawing up these interim condensed consolidated
financial statements are consistent with those used and set forth in the consolidated annual financial statements for
the financial year ending 31 December 2011.

_2.9.1 Concession intangible and financial assets_

The Group constructs or upgrades infrastructure (construction or upgrade services) used to provide a public service
and operates and maintains that infrastructure (operation services) for a specified period of time. These arrangements
may include Infrastructure used in a public-to-private service concession arrangement for its entire useful life.


-----

to the extent that the Group receives a right (a licence) to charge users of the public service. The financial asset model
is used when the Group has an unconditional contractual right to receive cash or another financial asset from or at the
direction of the grantor for the construction services. When the unconditional right to receive cash covers only part of
the service, the two models are combined to account separately for each component. If the Group performs more than
one service (i.e., construction or upgrade services and operation services) under a single contract or arrangement,
consideration received or receivable is allocated by reference to the relative fair values of the services delivered, when
the amounts are separately identifiable.

- An intangible asset is measured at the fair value of consideration transferred to acquire the asset, which is the fair
value of the consideration received or receivable for the construction services delivered. The intangible asset is
amortised over its expected useful life in a way that reflects the pattern in which the asset’s economic benefits are
consumed by the entity, starting from the date when the right to operate starts to be used (for example, in a toll
road concession the Group uses the number of cars that use the road). Based on these principles, the intangible
asset is amortised in line with the actual usage of the specific public facility, with a maximum of the duration of the
concession.

- In the financial asset model, the amount due from the grantor meets the definition of a receivable which is
measured at fair value. It is subsequently measured at amortised cost. The amount initially F-72ecognized plus the
cumulative interest on that amount is calculated using the effective interest method.

Any asset carried under concession arrangements is F-72ecognizedF-72i on disposal or when no future economic
benefits are expected from its future use or disposal or when the contractual rights to the financial asset expire.

_2.9.2 Intangible assets_

Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible assets
acquired in a business combination is their fair value at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible
assets are carried at cost less any accumulated F-72ecognizedF-72i and accumulated impairment losses.

Internally generated intangible assets, excluding F-72ecognizedF-72 development costs, are not F-72ecognizedF-72
and expenditure is reflected in profit and loss in the period in which the expenditure is incurred.

The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as either finite or indefinite.

Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over the useful economic life and assessed for impairment whenever
there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The F-72ecognizedF-72i period and the
F-72ecognizedF-72i method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at the end of each
reporting period. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic
benefits embodied in the asset are considered to modify the F-72ecognizedF-72i period or method, as appropriate,
and are treated as changes in accounting estimates. The F-72ecognizedF-72i expense on intangible assets with finite
lives is F-72ecognized in the income statement as the expense category that is consistent with the function of the
intangible assets.


-----

Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortised, but are tested for impairment annually, either
individually or at the cash-generating unit level. The assessment of indefinite life is reviewed annually to determine
whether the indefinite life continues to be supportable. If not, the change in useful life from indefinite to finite is made
on a prospective basis.

Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net
disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are F-73ecognized in the income statement when the
asset is F-73ecognizedF-73i.

a) Concessions

Concessions includes essentially the licence fees satisfied in certain concessions for operating car parks.

These administrative concessions are entered to assets at cost less accrued F-73ecognizedF-73i and accrued
valuation corrections due to impairment.

Concessions also include the access duties paid by means of a concession levy during the concession term. In this
case the concessions are included in the assets at the current value of the minimum payments agreed, without
considering contingent payments.

The concessions are amortised on a linear basis over the term of the concession.

b) IT applications

Licences acquired from third parties for computer programs are F-73ecognizedF-73 on the basis of acquisition costs
and the cost of adaptation to the specific programs.

The company depreciates its computer applications on a straight-line basis, distributing the cost of the assets over the
estimated useful life of the same, which is three years.

Costs involved in the development or maintenance of computer programs are F-73ecognized as an expense at the
time they are incurred. Costs directly related to the production of single identifiable computer programs controlled by
the Company and which will probably generate revenues greater than the costs during more than one year are
F-73ecognized as intangible assets. Direct costs include program development, personnel expenses and a suitable
proportion of overheads.

_2.9.3 Property, plant and equipment_

Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses,
if any. Such cost includes the cost of replacing part of the property, plant and equipment and borrowing costs for longterm construction projects if the recognition criteria are met. When significant parts of property, plant and equipment
are required to be replaced at intervals, the Group F-73ecognized such parts as individual assets with specific useful
lives and depreciates them accordingly. Likewise, when a major inspection is performed, its cost is F-73ecognized in
the carrying amount of the plant and equipment as a replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied. All other
repair and maintenance costs are F-73ecognized in profit or loss as incurred.

Property, plant and equipment transferred from customers is initially measured at the fair value at the date on which
control is obtained.

Land and buildings are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation on buildings and impairment losses
F-73ecognized.

Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:

**Useful life in years**
Buildings and other structures ................................................................................................................................ 50

Machinery, installations and tools................................................................................................................................10
Furnishings................................................................................................................................................................ 10
Transport vehicles........................................................................................................................................................ 6
Other fixed assets ........................................................................................................................................................ 3

An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant part initially F-73ecognized is F-73ecognizedF-73i upon
disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on
derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of
the asset) is included in the income statement when the asset is F-73ecognizedF-73i.


-----

financial year end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.

Car parks F-74ecognized in tangible assets (under the head of “Buildings”) are valued at acquisition price or
production cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the term of the concession.

_2.9.4 Borrowing costs_

Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes a
substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale are F-74ecognizedF-74 as part of the cost of the
asset. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they occur. Borrowing costs consist of interest
and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds.

_2.9.5 Financial assets_

a) Loans and receivables:

Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in
an active market. After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using
the effective interest rate method, less impairment. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or
premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the effective interest rate. The effective interest
rate F-74ecognizedF-74i is included in finance income in the income statement. The losses arising from impairment
are F-74ecognized in the income statement in finance costs for loans and in cost of sales or other operating expenses
for receivables.

b) Investments in the equity of group, multi-group and associated companies:

These are valued at cost less accrued impairment corrections, if any. Notwithstanding, in the event that investment in
a company is prior to classification of the same as a Group, Multi-group or Associated Company, the cost of the
investment is considered to be the book value prior to such classification. Prior valuation adjustments directly entered
to net equity are maintained until cancellation.

Investments in equity of group and associated companies are F-74ecognized in the books, in both current and noncurrent assets.

Current assets include short-term investments comprising corporate loans and other financial assets in group and
associated companies.

The balance of long-term investments comprising equity instruments in group and associated companies are
registered in non-current assets. Equity instruments are disclosed in the balances of interests in group companies,
interests in associated companies and pending disbursements on shares not requested.

In the event of objective evidence that book value is unrecoverable, the relevant valuation correction is applied as the
difference between book value and the recoverable amount, the latter understood as whichever is the greater between
fair value less sales costs and the current value of future cash flows deriving from the investment.

_2.9.6 Derivative financial instruments_

Derivative financial instruments are initially F-74ecognized at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is
entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair
value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative.

Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives are taken directly to profit or loss, except for
the effective portion of cash flow hedges, which is F-74ecognized in other comprehensive income.

The Group only disposes of Cash flow hedges:

The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is F-74ecognized directly in other comprehensive
income in the cash flow hedge reserve, while any ineffective portion is F-74ecognized immediately in the income
statement as other operating expenses.

Amounts F-74ecognized as other comprehensive income are transferred to profit or loss when the hedged transaction
affects profit or loss, such as when the hedged financial income or financial expense is F-74ecognized or when a
forecast sale occurs. When the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset or non-financial liability, the amounts
F-74ecognized as other comprehensive income are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset
or liability.

If the forecast transaction or firm commitment is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss previously
F-74ecognized in equity is transferred to the income statement. If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated


-----

previously F-75ecognized in other comprehensive income remains in other comprehensive income until the forecast
transaction or firm commitment affects profit or loss.

_2.9.7 Business Combinations and Goodwill_

Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the
aggregate of the consideration transferred measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. For each business combination, the Group elects whether to measure the noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets.
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred and included in administrative expenses.

When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate
classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent
conditions as at the acquisition date. This includes the separation of embedded derivatives in host contracts by the
acquiree.

If the business combination is achieved in stages, the previously held equity interest is remeasured at its acquisition
date fair value and any resulting gain or loss is F-75ecognized in profit or loss.

Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be F-75ecognized at fair value at the acquisition
date.

Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the
amount F-75ecognized for non-controlling interest over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If
the fair value of the net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate consideration transferred, the gain is
F-75ecognized in profit or loss.

After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of
impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the
Group’s cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets
or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.

Where goodwill has been allocated to a cash-generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of,
the goodwill associated with the disposed operation is included in the carrying amount of the operation when
determining the gain or loss on disposal. Goodwill disposed in these circumstances is measured based on the relative
values of the disposed operation and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained.

_2.9.8 Stock_

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net F-75ecognized value.

The cost of finished products and products in progress corresponds to construction in progress and completed, and
includes costs incurred in construction of car parks intended for concession.

Parking spaces intended for sale and included in Stocks are valued at acquisition price or production cost.

Net F-75ecognized value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of
completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.

_2.9.9 Cash and other equivalent liquid assets_

Cash and short-term deposits in the Condensed Interim Consolidated Statement of Financial Position comprise cash
at banks and on hand and short-term deposits with a maturity of three months or less.

This section includes short-term restricted cash flow. This item includes investments of the same nature and expiry
date related to financing of specific infrastructure projects, the availability of which is restricted by financing contracts
as guarantee of meeting specific short-term obligations relative to payment of interest or principle of the debt and for
future maintenance of the infrastructure.

_2.9.10 Net Equity_

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net profit attributed to the controlling company by the average
weighted number of ordinary shares in circulation during said period. In turn, the diluted profit per share is calculated
by dividing the net income attributable to ordinary shareholders by the average weighted number of ordinary shares in
circulation during the period, because there is no equity instruments issued that could become, at future, into shares
of the Parent Company.


-----

condensed consolidated financial statements as of 30 September 2012, there is no discrepancy between basic and
diluted earnings per share.

_2.9.11 Transactions between related parties_

As a general rule transactions between related parties initially F-76ecognized at fair value. Where appropriate, if the
agreed price differs from fair value the difference is entered according to the financial reality of the transaction.
Subsequent valuation is carried out in compliance with the provisions of the corresponding accounting standards.

_2.9.12 Subsidies_

Government grants are F-76ecognized where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and all
attached conditions will be complied with. When the grant relates to an expense item, it is F-76ecognized as income
on a systematic basis over the periods that the costs, which it is intended to compensate, are expensed. When the
grant relates to an asset, it is F-76ecognized as income in equal amounts over the expected useful life of the related
asset.

When the Group receives non-monetary grants, the asset and the grant are recorded at nominal amounts and
released to profit or loss over the expected useful life in a pattern of consumption of the benefit of the underlying asset
by equal annual instalments. When loans or similar assistance are provided by governments or related institutions,
with an interest rate below the current applicable market rate, the effect of this favourable interest is regarded as a
government grant.

_2.9.13 Provisions and contingent liabilities_

Provisions are F-76ecognized when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past
event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation
and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. When the Group expects some or all of a
provision to be reimbursed, for example, under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is F-76ecognized as a
separate asset, but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense relating to a provision is presented
in the income statement net of any reimbursement.

Contingent liabilities are possible obligations arising as a result of past events, the F-76ecognizedF-76ionF-76 of
which depends on whether or not one or more future events outside the control of the Group occurs.

Given the activities in which the Group is currently engaged, it has no liabilities, expenses, assets or provisions and
contingencies of an environmental nature which could prove significant with reference to the equity, the financial
situation or result. Hence, specific breakdowns of information on environmental shares are not included in this report
on the annual financial statements.

Costs deriving from protection and improvement of the environment are attributed to consolidated result for the
financial year in which they are incurred, regardless of when the associated monetary or financial flow occurs.

When such expenses involve the acquisition of tangible assets the purpose of which is to F-76ecogniz environmental
impact and to protect and improve the environment, these are F-76ecognized as increased value of fixed assets.

_2.9.14 Financial liabilities_

Financial liabilities are classified as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, loans and borrowings, or as
derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate. The Group determines the
classification of its financial liabilities at initial recognition.

All financial liabilities are F-76ecognized initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings, net of directly
attributable transaction costs.

The Group’s financial liabilities include trade and other payables, loans and borrowings and derivative financial
instruments.

The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification as described below:

**_Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss_**

Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities
designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss.


-----

category includes derivative financial instruments entered into by the Group that are not designated as hedging
instruments in hedge relationships. Separated embedded derivatives are also classified as held for trading unless they
are designated as effective hedging instruments.

Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are F-77ecognized in the income statement.

Financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss are designated at the initial
date of recognition, and only if the criteria in IAS 39 are satisfied. The Group has not designated any financial liability
as at fair value through profit or loss.

**_Loans and borrowings_**

After initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the
effective interest rate method. Gains and losses are F-77ecognized in profit or loss when the liabilities are
F-77ecognizedF-77i as well as through the effective interest rate F-77ecognizedF-77i process.

Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are
an integral part of the effective interest rate. The effective interest rate F-77ecognizedF-77i is included as finance
costs in the income statement.

**_Derecognition_**

A financial liability is F-77ecognizedF-77i when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled, or expires.

When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the
terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the
derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying
amounts is F-77ecognized in the income statement.

_2.9.15 Income tax and deferred taxes_

As of 1 January 2005 the Group began paying tax under the consolidated tax system with Cintra Concessions de
Infraestructuras de Transporte, S.A. as a result of the change in ownership which occurred in 2004, following which
the Parent Company fell within the aforesaid tax Consolidation perimeter. The Group previously paid taxes under the
consolidated taxation system as part of the Ferrovial, S.A. Group. During 2009 and as a consequence of the
purchase-sale transaction, the Group left the aforementioned tax status and the Company as of 31 December 2009
requested taxation as a fiscal group effective 1 January 2010. The fiscal group is composed of the following
companies:

- Empark, Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A.

- Dornier, S.A.U.

- Femet, S.A.

- Guadianapark, S.A.

- Balsol 2001, S.A.

- Estacionamientos Guipuzcoanos, S.L.U.

- Empark Aparcamientos Andalucia, S.L.

- Empark Aparcamientos Extremadura, S.L.

**_Current income tax_**

Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current period are measured at the amount expected to be recovered
from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are
enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

Current income tax relating to items F-77ecognized directly in equity is F-77ecognized in equity and not in the income
statement. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in which
applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate.


-----

Deferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and
liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes at the reporting date.

Deferred tax liabilities are F-78ecognized for all taxable temporary differences, except:

- When the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction
that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor
taxable profit or loss

- In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in
joint ventures, when the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that
the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future

Deferred tax assets are F-78ecognized for all deductible temporary differences, the carry forward of unused tax
credits and any unused tax losses. Deferred tax assets are F-78ecognized to the extent that it is probable that taxable
profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits
and unused tax losses can be F-78ecogniz, except:

- When the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an
asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects
neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.

- In respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests
in joint ventures, deferred tax assets are F-78ecognized only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary
differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary
differences can be F-78ecogniz

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no
longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be
F-78ecogniz. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and are F-78ecognized to the
extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset
is F-78ecogniz or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively
enacted at the reporting date.

Deferred tax relating to items F-78ecognized outside profit or loss is F-78ecognized outside profit or loss. Deferred tax
items are F-78ecognized in correlation to the underlying transaction either in other comprehensive income or directly
in equity.

Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets
against current income tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation
authority.

Tax benefits acquired as part of a business combination, but not satisfying the criteria for separate recognition at that
date, are F-78ecognized subsequently if new information about facts and circumstances change. The adjustment is
either treated as a reduction to goodwill (as long as it does not exceed goodwill) if it was incurred during the
measurement period or F-78ecognized in profit or loss.

_2.9.16 Foreign currencies_

The Group’s Condensed Interim Consolidated Statement of Financial Position are presented in Euros, which is also
the parent company’s functional currency.

The financial statements of companies in foreign currency have been converted to Euros using the closing exchange
rate method and average rate method in accordance with the following rates:

**January-September** **September** **January-September**

**2012** **2012** **2011**

**Exchange Rate** **average** **Closing** **average**

Euro / Pound Sterling................................................................ 0.812 0.798 0.871
Euro / Turkish Lira ................................................................ 2.309 2.320 2.292

_2.9.17 Recognition of revenue_

Revenue is F-78ecognized to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the
revenue can be reliably measured, regardless of when the payment is being made. Revenue is measured at the fair
value of the consideration received or receivable, taking into account contractually defined terms of payment and


-----

acting as principal or agent. The Group has concluded that it is acting as a principal in all of its revenue arrangements.
The specific recognition criteria described below must also be met before revenue is F-79ecognized.

The Group F-79ecognized revenue when the amount can be reliably valued, future earnings are probable and certain
specific conditions are met for each activity as set forth below. It is considered that a reliable estimate of the value of
the income cannot be made until all contingencies associated with the sale have been settled. The Group bases its
estimate on historical result, taking the type of client, the type of transaction and the specific terms of each agreement
into account.

a) The car park business may be divided into:

a.1) Off-street and mixed parking

a.2) On-street car parks (ORA)

a.3) Car parks for local residents

a.1) Off-street and mixed parking

Off-street parking revenues are recorded when de hourly parking rate is paid, and, on an accrual basis, in the case of
season ticket-holders. Car parks which contain off-street and residents’ spaces, called mixed, record their income, for
off-street spaces, as described above, and for residents, the income is imputed to the income statement when the
transfer of use of these parking spaces takes place.

The cost of residential parking spaces is registered in inventories and entered to the income statement on the date of
the transfer of the concession of usage.

a.2) Regulated on-street parking (ORA)

Revenue from the ORA regulated limited time parking service derives from the cost of providing the service plus a
percentage, generally between 1% and 3%, of the difference between service cost and the funds collected. In some
ORA contracts a fixed percentage is obtained, to be paid by the council. This is registered in the accounts at the time
when the service is provided.

a.3) Residential off-street car parks

This business involves the construction of car parks whose spaces are sold directly to the end customer during the
term of the concession. The sales and costs are not registered until the parking space is delivered, which tends to
coincide with signature of the contract, or exceptionally, the public deed of sale.

_2.9.18 Leases_

The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at
the inception date. The arrangement is assessed for whether F-79ecognizedF-79 of the arrangement is dependent on
the use of a specific asset or assets or the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset or assets, even if that right is
not explicitly specified in an arrangement.

**_Group as a lessee_**

Finance leases that transfer substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item to the
Group, are F-79ecognizedF-79 at the commencement of the lease at the fair value of the leased property or, if lower,
at the present value of the minimum lease payments. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and
reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are F-79ecognized in finance costs in the income statement.

A leased asset is depreciated over the useful life of the asset. However, if there is no reasonable certainty that the
Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term, the asset is depreciated over the shorter of the estimated
useful life of the asset and the lease term.

Operating lease payments are F-79ecognized as an operating expense in the income statement on a straight-line
basis over the lease term.

**_Group as a lessor_**

Leases in which the Group does not transfer substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of an asset are
classified as operating leases. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating an operating lease are added to the carrying


-----

rents are F-80ecognized as revenue in the period in which they are earned.

_2.9.19 Operating seasonality_

Net turnover and Group profits are not significantly influenced by operating seasonality.

**3 Management of financial and currency risks**

The Group’s activities are exposed to certain financial risks: market risk (including exchange rate risk, interest rate risk
and price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.

Risk management is carried out by the Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A. Financial Directorate General which
identifies, assesses and hedges financial risks in accordance with the policies approved by the Board of Directors.
The Board provides policies for comprehensive risk management and for specific areas such as exchange rate risk,
interest rate risk, liquidity risk, use of derivative and non-derivative instruments and investment of surplus liquidity.

The financial risks to which the Group is exposed include those deriving from guarantees and sureties required in
order for the Group to undertake its activities.

During the 2011 financial year and the nine month period ended 30 September 2012, the Company maintained bank
guarantees with third parties and guarantee commitments with other Group companies in order to engage in its
business.

**_Market risk: Exchange rate risk_**

Management has established an exchange rate risk management policy for foreign currencies in relation to the
working currency. The Treasury Department negotiates forward contracts in order to manage exchange rate risks
deriving from future commercial transactions and F-80ecognized assets and liabilities. Exchange rate risk arises
where future commercial transactions or F-80ecognized assets or liabilities are quoted in a currency other than the
F-80ecognizedF-80i’s functional currency.

The board of directors considers that there are not significant impacts on the interim condensed consolidated financial
statements produced by this risk.

**_Market risk: Cash flow interest rate risk and fair value risk_**

As of 30 September 2012, if interest rates on external resources quoted in Euros had been 50 base points
higher/lower, with all other variables remaining constant, the result after taxes for the period would have been
(976)/976 thousands of Euros lower/higher, mainly as a result of an increase/decrease in the cost of interest on
variable rate loans.

The Group carries out the corresponding interest rate hedges by contacting an IRS (Interest Rate Swap). (Note 15).

As of 30 September 2012 60% of the total debt balance is hedged by these instruments.

The board of directors considers that there are not significant impacts on the interim condensed consolidated financial
statements produced by this risk.

**_Credit risk_**

Credit risk is managed by groups. Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents and deposits held in banks and
financial institutions and wholesale and retail clients including pending accounts receivable and committed
transactions. The Group only deals with credit institutions of F-80ecognized prestige and solvency.

The board of directors considers that there are not significant impacts on the interim condensed consolidated financial
statements produced by this risk.

**_Liquidity risk_**

Prudent management of liquidity risk involves holding sufficient cash and tradable securities, having access to finance
through sufficient agreed credit facilities and having the capacity to unwind market positions. Given the dynamic
nature of the underlying businesses, the object of the Group’s Treasury Department is to maintain financing flexibility
by the availability of credit lines.

The board of directors considers that there are not significant impacts on the interim condensed consolidated financial
statements produced by this risk.

**146,051** **146,102**

**_Impairment tests_**

The Group undertakes an annual procedure in order to identify any possible impairment in the registered cost with
regard to the recoverable value of goodwill.

Possible impairment is calculated by comparing the recorded value with the recoverable value, the latter understood
as the value of future cash flows it is estimated the cash- generating unit (CGU) will generate based on objective
hypotheses and discounted at an estimated capital cost based on the risk-free rate using the 30-year bond, the risk
level of the cash-generating unit (CGU) and estimated market premium as the yardstick.

Additionally, residual value is calculated incorporating renewal of contracts and growth.

In order to establish the present value of the future cash flows of the cash-generating unit (CGU), the following
hypotheses were applied:

- It was established that the cash-generating unit (CGU) will generate flows over the periods up to maturity, of
between 5 and 50 years depending on the concession.

- The corresponding revenue and expenditure forecasts were performed, in accordance with the following general
criteria:

    - In the case of revenue, in order to estimate the evolution of rates consideration was given to the official
forecast for the evolution of the consumer price index (CPI) in each of the countries where the investments
are operational (2.5% in both Spain and Portugal), the corresponding formulae for the adjustment of rates as
set out in the concession contracts, on the basis of the evolution of price indices and/or any specific correction
factors which may apply.

In the case of new contracts consideration was given to a ramp up in demand over the first 2-5 years of the
concession in accordance with a specific analysis of each contract, followed by an estimate of evolution of
revenue similar to previous rates.

    - In terms of expenditure, the evolution thereof was calculated on the basis of the corresponding expected
evolution in the CPI rates (2.5% in both Spain and Portugal), in addition to the forecast evolution of the
business.

    - Consideration was also given to the impact of works to be performed in order to maintain and improve
infrastructure, based on the best estimate available according to the experience, and taking into consideration
the forecast evolution of the business.

    - Consideration was given to the future costs and revenue corresponding to renewals of contracts and also the
investments required for these renewals on the basis of the investments occurring on previous contracts.

The renewal percentages employed in the different business lines (off-street, ORA on-street, management)
were estimated at between 75% and 85%, based on the actual rates obtained by the Group.

    - The forecast cash flows obtained on the basis of the projected revenue and expenditure, in accordance with
the aforementioned criteria, were updated at the discount rate resulting from adding to the long-term cost of
money the risk premium assigned by the market to the country where the company performs its operations,
the risk premium assigned by the market to each business (both based on a long-term vision), along with the
financial structure of the cash-generating unit in question. The discount rate employed was 8.24 %.

As a result of the impairment test performed, it has been revealed that the various cash-generating units to which the
various recorded sums of goodwill are assigned will serve to recover the net value of each of the sums recorded by
30 September 2012, and there is therefore no need to establish any form of impairment provision.

No indications of impairment in the existing goodwill were uncovered.

_1 – Income generated by off-street car parks_

Revenue from off-street car parks corresponds to revenues generated through the use of parking spaces owned by
the Group or held under an administrative concession. Off-street car park revenues are recorded when the hourly
parking rate is paid and, in the case of season ticket-holders, on an accrual basis.


-----

This business involves the construction of car parks whose spaces are sold directly to the end customer during the
term of the concession. The sales and costs are not registered until the parking space is delivered, which coincides
with the signature of the contract.

_3 – Revenue generated by on-street car parks (ORA)_

Revenue from the ORA regulated limited time parking service derives from the cost of providing the service plus a
percentage, generally between 1% and 3%, of the difference between service cost and the funds collected. In some
ORA contracts revenue is earned at a fixed rate (service cost) which is independent of the funds collected (these
belong to the City Council). This is registered in the accounts on provision of the service.

_4 – Revenue generated through other services (management y others)_

The Group also F-98ecognizedF-98 in provision of other services associated with the comprehensive management of
parking and urban and interurban mobility such as: Management of control of access to nature reserves, provision of
temporary parking services at trade fairs and mass attendance events, combined park and bus services around
airports.

**_Main litigations under way as of 30/09/2012_**

1.– Major claim by Obrascon Huarte Laín, S.A. against Ferrovial Aparcamientos, S.A. (today Empark Aparcamientos y
Servicios, S.A.) against Ferrovial Aparcamientos, S.A., Vista Desarrollo, S.A., Caixa Penedés, CARIPLO and Bolsa
de Madrid requesting the cancellation of the collateral ruling affecting 850,614 shares of ESSA (today Empark
Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A.).

A judgement upholding the arguments of Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A. and the other respondents has
been handed down, and this lawsuit must therefore be deemed to be concluded, following the Supreme Court
judgment of 10 December 2008. As costs were awarded against the plaintiff, Empark has filed three Cost Calculation
applications, claiming from Obrascón Huarte Laín, (OHL) the payment of fees corresponding to Court Agents and
Lawyers. Currently the only one pending resolution is before the Supreme Court, in the sum of 224 thousand of Euros.
As at today’s date the sum being claimed has been confirmed by the Judicial Secretary, and it is awaiting a decision
by the Judges.

Furthermore, Counsel Félix López Antón Esq., who assumed the defence of Empark’s interests in various instances of
this proceeding, presented three proceedings for collecting legal fees against Empark claiming payment of fees
incurred for the Lower Court, the Provincial High Court and the Supreme Court. The situation regarding these
proceedings is as follows:

- First Instance: Legal fees have been set by the court at 117 thousands of Euros (plus VAT) from which 54 (plus
VAT) thousands must be deducted for fees already satisfied by Empark to the Lawyer. The sum pending payment
was therefore 63 thousands of Euros (plus VAT), this sum having been lodged with the Court on 17 September
2010. The interest calculated at a sum of 3 thousands of Euros has also been lodged. The costs of the claim
proceedings must still be settled, valuation being pending.

The lawyer López Antón requested a record of various written submissions and rulings handed down in this appeal,
possibly in order to file these with the corresponding court bodies in order to establish any legal action which the
practice Despacho López Antón, S.L.P. could bring against Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A., with these
declarations being issued by means of a Regulation Order dated 10 October 2011.

- Provincial Court: The fees accruing at the Provincial High Court were initially set by the court itself at the sum of 31
thousands of Euros (including VAT), of which Empark had already previously paid 8 thousands of Euros. The
invoicing lawyer nonetheless petitioned for this ruling to be struck down, claiming that there was a clear error in
application of the scale according to the Fee Standards of the Lawyers’ Association of Madrid. Said nullity was
allowed by the Court and fees have finally been set at 47 thousands of Euros (plus VAT), from which 8 thousands
of Euros shall be deducted. Leaving 39 thousands of Euros (plus VAT). The entire sum of the debt has now been
lodged, and the VAT has been paid out of court, following presentation of the corresponding invoice. The costs in
the proceedings have not been valued.

The lawyer López Antón requested a record of various written submissions and rulings handed down in this appeal,
possibly in order to file these with the corresponding court bodies in order to establish any legal action which the
practice Despacho López Antón, S.L.P. could bring against Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A., with these
declarations being issued by means of a Regulation Order dated 11 October 2011.


-----

from which a sum 10 thousands of Euros already previously paid by Empark would need to be deducted. The
remaining amount of 33 thousands of Euros has been deposited by Empark. The invoicing lawyer petitioned for the
proceedings to be declared null and void. This position was not accepted by the Supreme Court, with a further
petition for clarification then being lodged. This was likewise rejected in a Ruling of 12 July 2011.

The practice Despacho López Antón Abogados, S.L.P., as a result of the fees claimed for in the previous legal fee
claims proceedings, has also lodged a lawsuit under ordinary court proceedings, claiming for: (i) the part not settled
of the fees claimed for in the extraordinary procedural violation and cassation appeals (2901/2003), and which were
not F-102ecognized in the legal fee payment claim proceedings, amounting to 137 thousands of Euros, plus the
corresponding VAT, and 15 thousands of Euros of late-payment interest accruing, notwithstanding any which may
subsequently accrue up until payment of the debt; (ii) the late-payment interest accruing and not F-102ecognized
by the Provincial High Court of Madrid on the basis of the fees F-102ecognized in the legal fee claim proceedings,
this sum amounting to 2 thousands of Euros. The claim was notified to EMPARK on 28 December 2011 and was
answered on 26 January 2012. The Preliminary Hearing was held on 4 June 2012, and the trial is to be held on
5 November 2012.

they are incurred, regardless of the time the associated monetary or financial flow occurs.

Provisions relative to probable or certain responsibilities, legal proceedings in process, compensation and pending
obligations of undetermined amounts of an environmental nature not covered by contracted insurance policies are
made when the liability or the obligation establishing the compensation becomes effective.

With respect to potential environment-related contingencies, the directors consider that these would not have any

## EMPARK Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A. and Subsidiaries

 Interim consolidated management report for the nine-month period ended 30 September 2012

**Economic activity for the financial year**

During the first nine months of 2012 the company carried on business in a difficult financial and economic environment
due to the persistent worldwide recession. This recession has caused a significant decrease in economic and financial
activity which has also been noticed in Spain and Portugal, the group’s main markets.

In spite of this slump the performance of the Empark Group has been very positive, showing considerable resistance
and excellent management capacity, which has enabled us to obtain a recurring EBITDA in the first nine months of
2012 of 44,379 thousands of Euros.

The group leads the Spanish and Portuguese car parking markets and has been involved in the construction,
management and operation of underground as well as on-street parking since 1968.

It has succeeded in developing the activities required to provide optimal integrated vehicle management services in
any environment. This is supported by the management carried out by the Group during the financial year with more
than 380,000 parking spaces in Spain, Portugal, Andorra, United Kingdom, and Turkey.

Its presence in the industry includes all lines of business:

**_a) Off-street parking_**

The Group designs, builds and operates all manner of off-street parking within any context and employing any
formula.

Car parks in city centres, in the vicinity of hospitals, airports, bus or train stations, park-and-ride operations and car
parks in national parks are some of the parking solutions in which the Group has proven experience throughout every
region of Spain and Portugal.

**_b) On-Street parking_**

The Group, through its subsidiaries, is one of Europe’s most experienced companies in this type of service and the
market leader in Spain and Portugal.

Employing the latest technology and drawing on the support of a powerful F-104ecognizedF-104i, the Group provides
services in more than 160 cities throughout Spain, Portugal, Andorra, United Kingdom and Turkey.

Other complementary services, such as the supply and maintenance of regulation technologies, management of
application and processing of penalties and provision of vehicle removal services are provided by the group in the
main cities of Spain and Portugal.

**_c) Other services_**

The Group F-104ecognizedF-104 in the provision of other services associated with end-to-end management of car
parking and urban and inter-urban mobility.

Among others, Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A. and Dornier, S.A.U. have substantial experience in:

Management of control of access to nature reserves.

Provision of temporary parking services at trade fairs and mass attendance events.

Combined park and bus services around airports.

Management of mass off-street multiple profile subscriber car parks, in particular for Hospitals and Airports, with high
levels of 24/24 operation.

Comprehensive management of F-104ecognizedF-104ion, removal and deposit of vehicles.

The Group has developed its executive and managerial skills during its extensive experience in the industry.

- Current competitive advantages include: Nationwide and international presence, ensuring direct management of all
businesses, as well as a direct relationship with all public and/or private customers.


-----

presence, providing synergies and key know-how.

- Technological innovation, which allows the company not only to be more competitive but also enables it to offer
innovative solutions for traffic planning, design, etc.

- Presence in all areas of the business, enabling us to offer integrated solutions and save costs.

- The ability to offer complex construction solutions.

**Financial Information**

The net turnover amounted to a figure of 136,028 thousand of Euros during the first nine months of 2012, and 166,285
in the first nine months of 2011, the reduction being due for the most part to the sale of residents’ spaces taking place
in 2011 as a result of the completion of the Plaza de Cataluña and Plaza de Cervantes car parks.

Net turnover net of the effect of the sale of residents’ spaces was 135,760 thousand of Euros during the first nine
months of 2012 and 139,056 thousand of Euros in the first nine months of 2011, which represents a reduction of
(2.37)%.

The Group’s average workforce of the first-nine months of the year 2012 is made up of 3,064 employees of whom 39
% are women and 61 % men.

The Company’s financial risk management policy is based on Group management of capital in order to guarantee that
it will be in a position to continue operating as a profitable business while F-105ecognized shareholder return by
striking an optimum balance between debt and equity.

The main risks to which the Group is exposed are set forth below:

- Liquidity risk: Within its general policy the Group identifies treasury need using two tools: treasury budget with a 12
month horizon with monthly update breakdown, and treasury budget with a 30-day horizon, with daily update
breakdowns. These tools identify treasury needs in volume and time, and plan new financing needs.

- Credit risk: the Group maintains cash and equivalent liquid assets at financial institutions with a high-level credit
rating. It should furthermore be mentioned that there is no significant concentration of credit risk with third parties.

- Interest rate risk: interest-rate risk affects the Group essentially through long-term external resources. The Group
has contracted financial instruments that partially cover the risk of possible interest rate hikes.

- Exchange rate risk: The Group has no significant exchange rate risk as most of its assets and liabilities, revenue
and expenses, are quoted in Euros.

**Environmental aspects**

Environmental activity is defined as any operation the main purpose of which is to prevent, reduce or repair damage
caused to the environment.

Investments deriving from environmental activities are valued at acquisition cost and registered as increased fixed
asset expenses in the financial year in which they are incurred, following the criteria described in note 2 regarding
applicable accounting standards.

Costs deriving from environmental protection and improvement are attributed to result for the financial year in which
they are incurred, regardless of the time the associated monetary or financial flow occurs.

Provisions relative to probable or certain responsibilities, legal proceedings in process, compensation and pending
obligations of undetermined amounts of an environmental nature not covered by contracted insurance policies are
made when the liability or the obligation establishing the compensation becomes effective.

As of 30 September 2012, costs or expenses incurred with regard to environmental aspects are insignificant.

With respect to potential environment-related contingencies, the directors consider that these would not have any
significant impact on interim condensed consolidated financial statements.

## EMPARK Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A. and Subsidiaries

 Explanatory Notes on 2012

**1 Group’s activities and consolidation scope**

**_1.1 Companies forming the Group and their business_**

The EMPARK Group, hereinafter the Group, comprises the dominant company Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios,
S.A., and its subsidiaries, joint businesses and associate companies. The registered company office is in Madrid at
address Plaza Manuel Gómez Moreno 2, ‘Edificio Alfredo Mahou’.

Through these companies, the Group engages in the following lines of business, which are its primary reporting
segments in accordance with IFRS 8.

Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A. previously named Cintra Aparcamientos, S.A. and prior to that named
Ferrovial Aparcamientos, S.A. and previously Ferrevisa, S.A., has as its main line of business the construction and
operation of car parks under public authority concession arrangements. Such concessions stipulate that, to fulfil the
concession timeframes, the car parks shall be returned to the granting company in perfect conditions of use, without
any payment for provision of service for the Group. The Subsidiaries carry out the same activity as the Parent
Company.

Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A., is the Parent Company of a group of 27 Dependent Companies, 5
Associates, has stakes in 2 JVs and 3 Companies as joint businesses.

For the purpose of drawing up the consolidated annual accounts, the assumption is that a group exists if the dominant
company has one or more dependent F-116ecognizedF-116io, over which the dominant company exerts control either
directly or indirectly.

Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A., the dominant company of the Group, was incorporated in Madrid on 29 July
1986 as a public limited company. It is registered with the Company Register of Madrid, on sheet M-53866, page 86,

**2 Summary of the main accounting principles**

**_2.1 Basis of presentation_**

The financial information listed in these annual reports has been drafted using the International Financial Reporting
Standards adopted by the European Union (IFRS-EU) and becomes effective at the closure of the financial year.
Regarding the methods used to apply these regulations, it is worth mentioning that the Group has opted, in cases
where the IFRS-EU allows different alternative criteria, to value the fixed and intangible assets at historical cost,
capitalizing financial costs during the construction period and for the case of jointly controlled companies and joint
ventures with existing companies, consolidate them using the proportional consolidation method. The Consolidated
Annual Reports have been prepared F-121ecogni on historic cost adjusted for the increase in value of the derivatives.
These criteria are the same ones applied in 2011.

The Group applied the IFRS-EU for the first time in financial year 2009 for drafting the consolidated financial
statements.

**_2.2 Accounting principles applied_**

_a) Standards and interpretations approved by the European Union, which are applicable to this financial year._

The accounting policies employed in drawing up the Consolidated Annual Report for the financial year ended on
31 December 2012 are the same as those applied to the Consolidated Annual Report for the financial year ended on
31 December 2011, except for the following modification applicable to financial years beginning from 1 January 2012
onwards:

- Modifications to IFRS 7 “Disclosures – Transfers of financial assets”: The IASB published modifications to IFRS 7 in
order to improve disclosures of financial assets which have been transferred. If the transferred assets are not
entirely cancelled in the Consolidated Annual Report, the company must disclose information to assist users of the
financial statements in understanding the relationship between these assets which have not been cancelled and the
related liabilities. If the assets have been entirely cancelled, but the company retains an ongoing involvement, the
disclosures must serve to evaluate the nature and risks associated with this ongoing involvement. These
modifications are applicable to financial years beginning from 1 July 2011 onwards. The Group has no assets of
such characteristics, and this therefore had no impact on the presentation of this Consolidated Annual Report.

_b) Standards and interpretations published by the IASB and approved by the European Union, but not applicable to_
_this financial year_

As of the date of publication of this Consolidated Annual Report, the following standards, modifications and
interpretations had been published by the IASB and approved by the European Union, but were not subject to
mandatory application:

- Amendments to IAS 1 “Presentation of items of other comprehensive income”: The modifications to IAS 1 change
the grouping of entries presented in another overall result. Entries which may be reclassified (or “recycled”) to the
statement of income at any future time are to be presented separate from those items which will never be
reclassified. The modification affects only presentation, and has no impact either on the financial situation or the
results of the Group. The modification is applicable to financial years beginning after 1 July 2012.

- IAS 19 revised “Employee benefits”: The modifications range from fundamental changes, such as the elimination of
the broker method and the concept of yields expected from assets covered by the plan, to simple clarifications and
textual revision. The Group has made a voluntary change to its accounting policy in order to acknowledge actuarial
losses and gains under other overall results for the present financial year. This modification will, however, affect the
net expenditure through benefits, as the expected return on the assets associated with the plan will be calculated


-----

modifications will be applicable to financial years beginning from 1 July 2013 onwards.

- IFRS 10 “Consolidated financial statements”: IFRS 10 establishes one single supervisory model applied to all
entities, including special purpose entities. The changes introduced by IFRS 10 will require Senior Management to
make substantial judgements in establishing which companies are controlled, and must therefore be consolidated
by the Dominant Company, in comparison with the requirements which would be set out in IAS 27. In accordance
with the preliminary analysis performed, IFRS 10 is not expected to have any impact on the investments currently
held by the Group. IFRS 10 is applicable to financial years beginning from 1 January 2014 onwards.

- IFRS 11 “Joint Arrangements”: IFRS 11 eliminates the option of accounting for controlled companies jointly by
using the proportional consolidation method. Jointly controlled companies are instead defined as joint entities, and
must be accounted for by using the equity method. The Group is currently evaluating the impact that this new
standard will have on the Group’s financial situation and results, although on the basis of the preliminary analyses
no significant impacts are expected.

- IFRS 12 ““Disclosure of interests in other entities”: IFRS 12 includes the disclosures previously listed under IAS 27
regarding the Consolidated Annual Report, in addition to all disclosures previously included in IAS 31 and IAS 28.
These disclosures refer to stakes in dependent companies, joint agreements, associated entities and structured
entities. New, additional disclosures are also required, although this has no impact on the financial position or
results of the Group. This standard will take effect for financial years beginning from 1 January 2014 onwards.

- IFRS 13 “Fair value measurement”: IFRS 13 establishes one single guide for all fair-value valuations in accordance
with the IFRS. IFRS 13 does not affect when the fair value must be used, but does offer a guide as to how to
establish the fair value in accordance with the IFRS where this is required or permitted. The Group is currently
evaluating the impact that this new standard will have on the Group’s financial situation and results, although on the
basis of the preliminary analyses no significant impacts are expected. This standard will take effect for financial
years beginning from 1 January 2013 onwards.

- IAS 28 revised “Investments in Associates and Joint Businesses”: It now also describes the application of the equity
method to investments in joint businesses, in addition to associated entities. The modification will take effect for
financial years beginning from 1 January 2014 onwards.

- IFRS IC 20 “Stripping costs in the production phase of a surface mine”: This interpretation applies to waste removal
costs (excavation) incurred during the production phase of an opencast mine. The interpretation establishes the
manner in which the profits derived from the excavation activity are to be accounted for. The interpretation takes
effect for financial years beginning from 1 January 2013 onwards. This new interpretation will have no impact
whatsoever on the Group.

- Amendment to IAS 32 “Compensation of financial assets and financial liabilities”: These modifications clarify the
meaning of “where a legal applicable right to offset is held”. These modifications likewise clarify application of the
principal of offsetting settlement systems (such as F-122ecognizedF-122 cash management systems) which apply
offset mechanisms based on gross sums items which do not arise simultaneously. These modifications are not
expected to have any form of impact on the financial situation or results of the Group, and will take effect for
financial years beginning from 1 January 2014 onwards.

- Amendment to IFRS 7 “Disclosures – Compensation of financial assets and financial liabilities”: These
modifications require the disclosure of information about offset rights and similar agreements (for example,
collateral agreements). The disclosures will provide information of use to users in evaluating the effect of
presentation of these agreements for net sums in the company’s financial position. The new disclosures are
mandatory for all those financial instruments offset in accordance with the terms of IAS 32. These modifications are
not expected to have any impact on the financial situation or on the results of the Group, and will take effect for the
financial years beginning from 1 January 2013 onwards.

- Amendment to IAS 12 “Deferred tax – Recovery of underlying assets”: The modification clarifies the calculation of
deferred taxes on real estate investments recorded at the fair value, including a presumption that the deferred taxes
on real estate investments valued using the fair value model described in IAS 40 should be established on the
basis that their book value will be recovered through sale. It furthermore introduces the requirement that the
deferred taxes on non-amortisable assets valued by means of the revaluation method described in IAS 16 should in
all cases be calculated on the basis of the sale of those assets. The modification applies to financial years
beginning from 1 January 2013 onwards, and will have no form of impact on the financial situation, results or
disclosures of the Group.

The Group intends to adopt these standards, modifications and interpretation when they take effect.


-----

At the date these consolidated financial statements were published, the following standards and modifications had
been published by the IASB but were not required to be followed and had not been approved by the EU:

- IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments”: Applicable to financial years beginning after 01 January 2015 for the IASB.

- Improvements to the IFRS: Applicable to financial years beginning after 01 January 2013 for the IASB.

- Amendments to IFRS 9 and IFRS 7 “Mandatory Effective Date and Transition Disclosures”: Applicable to financial
years beginning after 01 January 2015 for the IASB.

- Amendment to IFRS 10, IFRS 11 and IFRS 12 “Transition Guidance”: Applicable to financial years beginning after
01 January 2013 for the IASB.

- Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 11 and IAS 27 “Investment Entities”: Applicable to financial years beginning after
01 January 2014 for the IASB.

The Group is currently assessing the impact of applying these standards and modifications. In accordance with the
analyses performed to date, the Group believes that initial application thereof will have no significant impact on the
annual financial statements.

**_2.4. Negative working capital and operating company_**

The Group has a negative working capital as of 31 December 2012 of (40,789) thousands of euros (8,171) thousands
of euros in 2011. This circumstance, which could be indicative of uncertainty regarding the continuance of operations
of the Group is mitigated by the fact that these types of situations are common in these types of groups where a large
part of the sales are received in cash.

The Group operates a F-123ecognizedF-123 cash pooling system, by means of which Amsterdam handles cash
requirements at the group level.

Additionally, the group has lines of credit and other financial resources available for its treasury needs (note 21).

Therefore, the Board of Directors considers appropriate to prepare the annual reports based on the operating
company principle, which means the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities for the amounts and according to
how they are classified in the annual reports.


-----

The information contained in this Consolidated Annual Report is the responsibility of the Group’s Board of Directors.

In the Consolidated Annual Reports for the financial years ended in 2012 and 2011 have been carried out using
estimates by the Group’s Board of Directors to value some of the assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and
commitments listed in them. These estimates essentially refer to:

- Evaluation of potential losses due to the impairment of certain assets.

- Useful life of material and intangible assets.

- Estimates related with the fair value of the assets purchased in business combinations and goodwill.

- Evaluation of possible contingencies due to legal and tax risks.

These estimates were carried using the best available information as of 31 December 2012 and 2011 regarding the
analyzed facts. However, it is possible that events that may occur in the future require modifying these estimates,
which would be carried out in accordance with IAS 8 if applicable.

**_2.6 Resource management policies_**

The Group manages its investments after having carried out an in depth examination and control of potentially
attractive projects from the environmental, socio-labour, commercial, financial and economic perspectives, for the
purpose of achieving a sustainable and balanced growth.

In carrying out this task, the Group’s shareholders want to be in a balance position regarding expected investment
profits and the assumed level of risk.

**_2.7 Consolidation policies_**

During financial years 2012 and 2011, the individual annual accounting closing date for all companies included in the
scope of consolidation was the same. Likewise, for the purpose of uniformly presenting the different items that
comprise these consolidated annual accounts, uniform accounting criteria has been applied using the parent
company’s accounting criteria as a basis. The following methods have been applied to prepare the Consolidated
Annual Report:

a. **Full consolidation method: All companies considered subsidiaries are fully consolidated. For these purposes,**
subsidiaries are those companies in which Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A. maintains effective control
because it owns more than 50% of voting rights directly or indirectly by agreements with other shareholders. In
assessing whether the Group controls another F-124ecognizedF-124i, consideration is given to the existence
and impact of potential voting rights which can actually be exercised or converted. Inclusion in the scope of
consolidation of the Group is carried out from the first moment in which the control of the subsidiary becomes
effective. The value of the shares held by minority shareholders in equity and in the financial year results of fully
consolidated subsidiaries is listed in chapters “Minority interests” of the consolidated financial statements” and
“Results attributed to minority interests” of the consolidated income statement”. The losses attributed to minority
interests in a consolidated subsidiary, in the case that they exceed the amount of minority interests in the equity,
will be assigned as a reduction of the items corresponding to the majority, except if the aforementioned minority
interests have a biding obligation to cover all or part of the losses, and provided they have the capacity to make
the additional required investment. Where the subsidiary subsequently records earnings, these will be assigned
to the majority until its share in the losses that were previously absorbed by the majority shareholders has been
recovered.

b. **Consolidation method by the participation method: Subsidiaries are accounted for by the participation**
method. For these purposes, subsidiaries are defined as all those companies in which the group has significant
influence over management but does not exercise control or joint management with third parties. Under the
equity method, the percentage of share in equity held by that company in reserves as well as yearly results is
identified.

**c.** **Proportionate consolidation method: Applies to joint ventures, which are those in which contractually, the**
management of subsidiaries is carried out jointly by the parent company and by third parties not related with the
group. The assets and liabilities assigned to joint ventures, which are jointly controlled with other parties are
listed in the consolidated financial statement and classified in accordance with their specific nature in the existing
percentage share. In the same manner, the revenues and expenses arising from joint ventures are recognized in
the consolidated income statement in accordance with its own nature also mentioning the percentage of share.

**d.** **Balances and transactions with Group companies: The balances and transactions with Group companies are**
eliminated in the consolidation process.


-----

subsidiaries and joint ventures, whose records are denominated in a currency other than the Euro are translated
to euros by applying the year-end exchange rates to all its assets and liabilities except the balances of the
shares held in companies of the group and associated companies, which are converted using the rate at the time
they were included in the group. Within the consolidation process, the shares held in companies of the group are
eliminated against the shareholder equity, except in the associated companies, which are converted at the
exchange rate at closing.

The results are translated to euros at the average exchange rate for the year. Differences arising during the
translation process are recorded in the shareholder equity section as “currency translation differences”.

**_The consolidation has been carried out on the basis of the following criteria:_**

- The companies in which Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A. has more than a 50% stake in the registered
capital and/or whose management is effectively controlled by it, were fully consolidated.

- Companies in which Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A. is owner of 50% of the share capital, by the
proportionate consolidation method.

- The Temporary Joint Ventures are proportionally consolidated into the individual financial statements.

- Companies in which Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A. has a stake of between 20% and 49%, are
consolidated using the equity method.

The annual accounts of the foreign companies have been converted into euros on the basis of the year end exchange
rate for the assets and liabilities and the year’s average exchange rate for the profit and loss accounts. The
shareholders equity corresponding to the consolidated companies whose working currency is not the Euro has been
converted using historic exchange rates.

The equity of minority interests in the equity and earnings for the year of the fully consolidated companies are
presented under the captions “Minority Interests” in the consolidated financial statements and “Income Attributed to
Minority Interests” in the consolidated income statement, respectively (note 20).

_a) Dependent companies_

Dependent companies are those F-125ecognizedF-125io, including special purpose vehicles, over which the Group
exerts or could exert control, directly or indirectly, this being understood as the power to direct the financial and
operating policies of a business in order to derive economic benefits from its activities.

In assessing whether the Group controls another F-125ecognizedF-125i, consideration is given to the existence and
impact of potential voting rights which can actually be exercised or converted. Dependent companies are consolidated
from the date when control is transferred to the Group, and are excluded from the consolidation perimeter as soon as
such control ceases.

The cost of acquisition method is used in accounting for the acquisition of dependent companies. The acquisition cost
method is used in accounting for the acquisition of dependent companies The Iost of acquisition is the fair value of the
assets handed over, the asset instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed on the date of exchange, the fair
value of any additional consideration dependent on future events (provided that this is probable and a reliable value
can be placed upon it), in addition to those costs directly attributable to the acquisition.

The assets, liabilities, revenue and expenditure of dependent companies are incorporated in the consolidated annual
accounts on the basis of the full consolidation method:

1. The book values of stakes in the capital stock of dependent companies are compensated for, on the date of
acquisition, through the proportional part which the aforementioned values represent with regard to the fair value
of the assets acquired and liabilities undertaken.

2. The difference between the book value of the holding in the dependent company and the value attributable to
said holding out of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities undertaken is F-125ecognized, if positive,
as consolidation goodwill. Under the exceptional circumstance that the figure is negative, it is F-125ecognized as
revenue for the financial year in the consolidated income statement.


-----

3. The assets and liabilities of group companies are included in the consolidated balance sheet, with the same
valuations as recorded in the respective balance sheet of the companies in question, financial statement except
for assets acquired and liabilities undertaken on the date of acquisition, which are included in the consolidated
balance sheet on the basis of their fair value on the date of acquisition, following consideration of any
F-126ecognizedF-126io and impairments occurring from that date onwards.

4. The revenue and expenditure of Subsidiaries are included in the Consolidated Annual Report.

5. Debits and credits between companies included within the consolidation group are cancelled out, along with
revenue and expenditure involved in transactions between such companies, and results generated on the basis
of such transactions, if not performed with third parties.

If control is acquired in stages, the goodwill (or the negative consolidation difference) is established for each of the
individual transactions as the difference between the fair value of the holding and the net sum attributable to the
holding out of the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities undertaken which are in place on that date. The
identifiable assets and liabilities undertaken are included on the basis of the fair value in place at the time of
acquisition of control, with the entry for outside shareholders necessarily recording the sum based on their stake in the
equity.

The difference between the net sum attributable from the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired and in place
on the date of acquisition of control and the corresponding sum on each of the dates when the holdings were acquired
gives rise to an adjustment in the reserves of the Group, recorded net of the tax burden.

During 2012 the company Empark Aparcamientos Extremadura, S.L. and the company Segempark S.A. were
included.

_b) Associated companies_

Associated companies are F-126ecognizedF-126io over which any of the companies included within the consolidation
group exerts substantial influence. Substantial influence is deemed to exist if the Group has a stake in the company
and can intervene in its financial and operating policy decisions, without having actual control.

When the equity method procedure is first applied, investments in associated companies are valued at the sum
corresponding to the percentage represented by the holding at the time of the investment, based on the fair value of
the assets acquired and liabilities undertaken. If the resulting difference between the cost of the stake and this value is
positive, this is included in the book value of the investment. If it is negative, the difference is recorded directly in the
global consolidated income statement.

Any variations experienced during the financial year in progress in the equity of the Group included in the consolidated
annual accounts under the equity method, following elimination of the proportion based on results generated in
transactions between that company and the company holding the stake, or any other group company, and not
involving third parties, increase or reduce, as applicable, the book value of the holding in question to the
corresponding proportion, following consideration of any F-126ecognizedF-126io and impairments occurring since the
method was applied for the first time.

Profits distributed by the Group included in the consolidated annual accounts under the equity method reduce the
book value of the holding.

A F-126ecognizedF-126ion of values and over time is applied to associated investments in the same way as for
dependent companies.

The information referring to the investment in the Associated companies which are consolidated under the equity
method are the following:

The associated companies which make up the Group have had of the equity method applied in their consolidation.

_c) TJVs (Temporary Joint Ventures) and Companies as Joint Businesses_

The balance sheets and the profit and loss accounts of these companies have been consolidated proportionally in the
consolidated financial statement and in the consolidated income statement as of 31 December 2012.

The group F-126ecognized the proportional part corresponding to it of assets controlled jointly and liabilities incurred
jointly in accordance with the percentage stake, along with assets attached to joint operations which are under control
and liabilities incurred as a result of joint business.

Likewise, the consolidated income statement F-126ecognized the corresponding part of revenue generated and costs
incurred through the joint business. Costs incurred with regard to the stake in the joint business are likewise recorded.


-----

sums of reciprocal assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and cash flows.

- During 2012 the UTE Jado and the UTE Aparcamientos joint ventures were wound up.

_d) Operations and assets controlled jointly_

Non-realised results deriving from reciprocal transactions are eliminated in proportion to the stake, in addition to the
sums of reciprocal assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and cash flows.

**_2.8 Main valuation standards applied in preparing the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the Consolidated_**
**_Income Statement._**

_2.8.1 Intangible assets_

Tangible fixed assets are initially valued at their cost, whether the price of acquisition or the cost of production. The
cost of intangible fixed assets acquired by means of the combination of businesses is stated as the fair value on the
date of acquisition.

Following initial recognition, the intangible fixed assets are valued at their cost, less the cumulative
F-127ecognizedF-127i and, where applicable, the cumulative sum of recorded impairment corrections.

a) Concessions

This section essentially includes the fees paid on certain concessions for the operation of car parks.

These administrative concessions are listed in the assets at their cost, less the cumulative F-127ecognizedF-127i and
the cumulative sum of acknowledged valuation corrections for impairment.

Concessions also include access rights paid by means of a concession fee during the period of the concession. In this
case the concessions are included under the assets at the current value of the minimum agreed payments, without
taking into consideration contingent payments.

The concessions are amortised on a linear basis over the period of the concession.

b) Computer applications

Licences acquired for computer programs from third parties are F-127ecognizedF-127 on the basis of the costs
incurred in acquiring them and preparing the specific program for use.

The Company amortises its computer applications on a linear basis, distributing the cost of the assets over the
estimated useful life of the same, which is three years.

The costs connected with the development or maintenance of computer programs are F-127ecognized as an expense
when they are incurred. The costs directly connected with the production of individual, identifiable computer programs
produced by the Group, provided that it is considered probable that they will generate economic benefits greater than
the costs for more than one year, are F-127ecognized as intangible fixed assets. Direct costs include the cost of the
personnel developing the computer programs and an appropriate percentage of general costs.

_2.8.2 Property, plant and F-127ecognize_

Tangible fixed asset elements are F-127ecognized at their cost of acquisition, with the addition of the costs incurred
up until their operational start-up, less the cumulative F-127ecognizedF-127i and the cumulative sum of
F-127ecognized losses.

The costs of the extension, F-127ecognizedF-127io or improvement of tangible fixed assets are incorporated within
the asset as an increase in its value only if they represent an increase in its capacity, productivity or an extension to its
useful life, and wherever it is possible to calculate or estimate the book value of the elements cancelled from the
inventory having been replaced.

The removal or disposal of any items is reflected in the accounts by eliminating the cost there of and the
corresponding cumulative F-127ecognizedF-127i.

The costs of major repairs are recorded as assets and amortised over the course of their estimated useful life, while
recurrent maintenance expenses are debited to the income statements during the financial year in which they occur.


-----

The F-128ecognizedF-128i of tangible fixed assets, except for land, which is not amortised, is calculated in
accordance with the values of the updated cost, following the linear method based on the estimated useful life, in
accordance with the depreciation actually suffered through operation, usage and enjoyment. The estimated useful
lifespans are:

**Estimated useful life**

Buildings and other construction................................................................................................................................ 50

Machinery, installations and tools ................................................................................................................................ 10

Furniture and fittings .......................................................................................................................................................10
Transport elements ......................................................................................................................................................... 6
Other fixed assets ........................................................................................................................................................... 3

The car parks which are part of the tangible fixed assets (in the caption “Buildings”) are valued at the acquisition price
or at the production cost, depreciated on a straight-line basis over the life of the concession.

Where the book value of an asset is greater than its estimated recoverable value, its value is reduced immediately
down to the recoverable sum.

The income and expenses from selling tangible fixed assets are calculated by comparing the amount obtained by the
sale with the accounting value and are recorded in the income statement in the “Impairment and result through
disposal of fixed assets” caption.

The residual value and the useful life of the assets are reviewed, with adjustments made if necessary at the closure of
each balance sheet.

At least at the closure of the financial year, the need to perform valuation corrections based on impairment in value is
analysed

_2.8.3 Impairment losses_

In the case of goodwill, the group carries out annual value impairment tests. In the case of depreciable assets, at each
account closure the Group assesses the existence of any loss in value that forces it to reduce the carrying amount. If
any loss indication is present, the recoverable value of the asset is calculated in order to identify the scope of the loss
by impairment in case its recoverable value is lower than its book value, and its effect is recorded in the income
statement. Impairment losses must be assessed for each individual asset. If this is not possible, the impairment loss is
determined for the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash flows independent of flows from other
assets (cash-generating units).

The recoverable amount is the higher of the market value (arms length value less associated costs) and the value in
use. The usage value is calculated from estimated future cash flows, discounted at a rate that reflects the present
market value, taking into account the value of money and specific risks associated with the asset.

_2.8.4 Interest costs_

Financial costs directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of fixed asset elements requiring a period of time
greater than one year in order to be fit for use are included in the cost until such time as the asset is in operational
condition.

_2.8.5 Financial assets_

a) Loans and items receivable:

Loans and items receivable are non-derivative financial assets with sums receivable which are fixed or can be
established and are not listed on an active market. These are included under current assets, except those with a
maturity date beyond twelve months from the date of the consolidated financial statement, which are classified as noncurrent assets. Loans and items receivable are included under “Corporate loans” and “Trade and other receivables”
on the balance sheet.

These are financial assets are initially valued at their fair value, and subsequently in accordance with their amortised
cost based on the effective rate of interest. Transaction costs directly attributable to their acquisition are
F-128ecognized in the consolidated income statement. On a quarterly basis, the necessary valuation corrections
based on impairment in value are applied, if there is any evidence that the entire sums owed will not be collected. The
sum of the value impairment loss is the difference between the book value of the asset and the value of the estimated
future cash flows, discounted at the effective rate of interest at the time of initial recognition. Any applicable valuation
corrections through impairment and reversion are recorded in the consolidated income statement.


-----

included under “Losses, impairment and variation in provisions through trade operations” in the consolidated income
statement.

The sums charged to the impairment account are normally cancelled once there is no expectation of more cash being
recovered.

The maximum exposure to credit risk on the date of submission of the information is the fair value of each of the
aforementioned categories of accounts receivable. The group maintains no guarantee as insurance.

b) Investments in the assets of group, multi-group and associated companies:

They are valued at their cost less, where applicable, the cumulative value of value impairment corrections. However,
where there is an investment made prior to the classification of a company as a Group, Multi-group or Associated
Company, the cost of the investment is assumed to be its book value prior to such classification. Prior valuation
adjustments entered into the accounts directly under the equity are maintained there until cancellation.

Investments in the assets of group and associated companies are included in the accounting records, under both
current assets and non-current.

The current assets include short-term investment in group and associated companies, comprising corporate loans and
other financial assets.

The non-current assets record the balance of long-term investments on group and associated companies, comprising
asset instruments. Asset instruments are broken down in the balances of holdings in group companies, holdings in
associated companies and share disbursements pending and not called on.

If there exists objective evidence that the book value is unrecoverable, the relevant valuation correction is applied as
the difference between the book value and the recoverable sum, the latter understood as whichever is the greater of
the fair value less the costs of sale and the current value of the future cash flows derived from the investment.

_2.8.6 Financial derivatives at fair value_

Derivatives are initially identified by their fair market value as of the contract date. The subsequent changes in market
value are recorded as well on each balance closing date. The method of identifying the profit and losses will depend
on if the instrument is designed as hedging or not and if it is, on the type of hedging. The different types of hedging
designated by the Group are the following:

i. Cash flow hedge: Its purpose is to hedge the exposure to highly probable future transactions and variations in
cash flow. The gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recorded by the non efficient section f the Consolidated
Income Statement, while the efficient part is identified directly on the Equity of the Consolidated Financial
statement. The amount deferred in equity is not F-129ecognized in the consolidated income statement until the
transactions hedged are taken to the income settlement or until the maturity date of the transactions. This
recognition is carried out the same way as the results of the hedge item.

In the case of derivatives that do not qualify as hedge items, the loss or gain of said instrument are recorded in the
consolidated income statement.

_2.8.7 Business Combinations and Goodwill_

The business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition cost method, which entails recognizing the fair
value of the assets and liabilities identified in the acquired business. Goodwill is the positive difference between the
cost of an investment and the value of the aforementioned assets and liabilities. In the acquisitions of subsidiaries, the
goodwill that is generated is considered as greater value of the share. The consolidated goodwill does not depreciate
and is subject to the “impairment test” (Note 6).

Goodwill is assigned to cash generating units for the purpose of performing impairment loss tests. This allocation is
made to those cash generating units expected to benefit from the merger of businesses during which the goodwill
arose.

_2.8.8 Stock_

Stock is valued at its cost or its net F-129ecognized value, whichever is the lower. The cost of stock is established by
application of the weighted average cost principle.

The cost of the finished products and products in progress correspond to construction in progress and completed, and
include the costs incurred in construction of car parking destined to concession of usage.


-----

If the cost is greater than the market value, the relevant valuation corrections are applied, and are F-130ecognized as
an expense in the profit and loss account. If the circumstances leading to the value correction cease to exist, the sum
of the correction is subject to reversion and is F-130ecognized as revenue in the consolidated income statement.

_2.8.9 Cash and other equivalent liquid assets_

Cash and other equivalent liquid assets include cash on hand, demand deposits at banks, and short term, high liquid
investments which initially have a maturity of three months or less and are not subject to a significant risk of changes
in value.

This section includes the short term restricted cash flow. This concept collects the investments of the same nature and
maturity affected by financing of specific infrastructure projects, whose availability is restricted by financing contracts
as guarantee to cover specific short term obligations relative to interests or principle of the debt as well as for the
future maintenance of the infrastructure.

_2.8.10 Net equity_

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are
presented in equity as a deduction, net of taxes. The purchasing of Parent Company shares by consideration paid,
including attributed associated costs are deducted from the equity. When these shares are sold or subsequently
reissued, any amount received net of costs includes the equity.

The basic profit by action is calculated as the quotient between the net profits attributed to the parent company and
the average weighted number of ordinary shares in circulation during said period. In turn, the diluted profit by action is
calculated as the quotient between the net results attributed to the ordinary shareholders and the average weighted
number of ordinary shares in circulation during said period.

In the case that the Group’s consolidated Annual Accounts correspond with the financial years ended on
31 December 2012 and 2011; the basic profits by action coincide with the diluted.

_2.8.11 Provisions for employees_

a) Pension commitments:

Fixed provision pension plans

Pension plans which are not classified as fixed contribution plans are deemed as fixed provision arrangements. In
general, fixed provision plans establish the sum of the provision to be received by the employee at the time of
retirement, normally in accordance with one or more factors, such as age, years of service and remuneration.

The Group F-130ecognized in its balance sheet a provision for fixed provision pension plans based on the difference
between the current value of the committed remunerations and the fair value of any possible assets subject to
commitments which are to be used to settle the obligations, with any appropriate deduction being made in accordance
with the sum of the costs of past services not yet F-130ecognized.

If the above difference gives rise to an asset, the value placed on this may not be greater than the current value of the
provisions which may be returned to the Group in the form of direct reimbursements or reduced future contributions
plus, where applicable, the part pending allocation to results through costs for past services. Any adjustment which the
Group may be required to make on the basis of this limit in the valuation of the assets is attributed directly to the
equity, being F-130ecognized as reserves.

The current value of the obligation is established by means of actuarial calculation methods and financial and actuarial
hypotheses which are unbiased and mutually compatible.

Any variation in calculation of the current value of the committed remunerations or, as applicable, the corresponding
assets, at the date of closure, as a result of actuarial profits and losses, is F-130ecognized in the financial year during
which it arises, recorded directly in the equity as reserves. For these purposes, profits and losses cover only variations
arising through changes in actuarial hypotheses or adjustments based on experience.

Costs of past services are F-130ecognized immediately in the consolidated income statement, except in the case of
revocable rights, in which case they are attributed to the consolidated income statement on a linear basis over the
remaining period up until the rights based on past services become irrevocable. However, if an asset is derived, the
revocable rights are attributed to the income statement immediately, unless a reduction occurs in the current value of
the provisions which may be returned to the Group in the form of direct reimbursement or reduced future contributions,
in which case the excess above this reduction is attributed immediately to the consolidated income statement.


-----

there were 76, 25 and 3 individuals with which the companies Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A., Dornier,
S.A.U. and Balsol 2001, S.A. respectively, had retirement commitments. These commitments are not significant.

b) Redundancy compensation:

Redundancy compensation is paid to employees as a result of a decision by the Group to terminate their employment
contracts prior to the normal retirement age, or if the employee agrees to retire voluntarily in exchange for such
provisions. The Group F-131ecognized these provisions when a proven commitment has been agreed for the
termination of the employment of workers, in accordance with a detailed, formal plan, with no possible withdrawal, or
an agreement has been reached to provide redundancy compensation as a result of an offer made in order to
encourage voluntary redundancies. Those provisions which are not payable within 12 months of the date of the
balance sheet are discounted at their current value.

_2.8.12 Transactions among related parties_

In general, operations among related parties are accounted for at the initial point at their fair value. In any case, if the
agreed price differs from the fair value, the difference is recorded in accordance with the economic reality of the
operation. The subsequent valuation is made in accordance with the terms set out in the corresponding regulations.

_2.8.13 Subsidies_

A subsidy is considered not refundable when there is an individual concession agreement for the subsidy, all the
conditions for its concession have been met and there are no reasonable doubts that payment will be collected.

The monetary type subsidies are valued using the fair value of the awarded amount.

_2.8.14 Provisions and contingent liabilities_

Provisions for contingencies and expenses are accounted for in accordance with the estimated amount required to
deal with probable or certain responsibilities, legal proceedings in progress and for compensation and pending
obligations of an undetermined amount, guarantees or other similar sureties.

Provisions are F-131ecognized in the balance sheet when the Group has a present obligation, either legal or implicit,
as a result of past events, where it is deemed probable that this will involve the need for outgoing resources for
settlement, and the sum can be estimated in a reliable manner.

Provisions are valued at the current value of the disbursements which are expected to be required in order to settle
the obligation, using a pre-tax rate which reflects the opinions of the current market as to the temporary value of
money and the specific risks of the obligation. Adjustments in the provision based on any updates are F-131ecognized
as a financial expense as they gradually accrue.

Provisions maturing within one year or less and with an insignificant financial impact are not discounted.

Contingent liabilities are possible obligations arising as a result of past events, the F-131ecognizedF-131ionF-131 of
which depends on whether or not one or more future events should occur, outside the control of the Group.

Given the activities in which the Group is currently engaged, it has no liabilities, expenses, assets or provisions and
contingencies of an environmental nature which could prove significant with reference to its equity, its financial
situation and its results. Hence, specific breakdowns are not included in the report herein on the consolidated annual
accounts with regards information on environmental issues.

Costs derived from the protection and improvements of the environment are attributed to the consolidated results for
the financial year in which they are incurred, irrespective of the point when the monetary or financial flow derived there
from occurs.

When such expenses involve the acquisition of tangible fixed assets the purpose of which is to F-131ecogniz
environmental impact and to protect and improve the environment, these are included in the accounts as an increase
in the value of fixed assets.


-----

_2.8.15 Financial liabilities_

Debts and items payable

These liabilities are initially carried at the fair net value of the expenses incurred in the transaction, subsequently
recording these by their depreciated cost according to the effective interest method. The effective interest rate is the
discount rate equal to the expected flow of future payments foreseeable up until maturity of the liability. In the case
that the effective interest rate is initially considered different from the market interest, the liability is valued taking into
account the actual value of the future flows at that market rate in the case of loans with set interest rates. If said
interest rate is not fulfilled, the valuation of these is also carried out at the aforementioned market interest rate.

In the event of a renegotiation of existing debts, it is considered that no substantial modification has occurred to the
financial liability if the lender of the new loan is the same as that which granted the initial loan and the current value of
the cash flows, including the associated issuance and execution costs using the effective interest method, varies by
no more than 10% from the current value of the cash flows pending payment on the original liability, calculated in
accordance with this same method.

_2.8.16 Income tax and deferred taxes_

The Group has since 1 January 2005 paid attacks under the consolidated taxation system at Cintra Concesiones de
Infraestructuras de Transporte, S.A., as a result of the change in ownership which occurred in 2004, following which
the Dominant Company fell within the aforementioned tax consolidation perimeter. The group previously paid taxes
under the consolidated taxation system as part of the Ferrovial, S.A. Group. During 2009, as a result of the sale
transaction referred, the Group left the aforementioned tax system, and on 31 December 2009 the company applied to
pay taxes as a tax group, with effect from 1 January 2010. This group comprises the following companies:

- Empark, Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A.

- Dornier, S.A.U.

- Femet, S.A.

- Guadianapark, S.A.

- Balsol 2001, S.A.

- Estacionamientos Guipuzcoanos, S.L.U.

- Empark Aparcamientos Andalucia, S.L.

- Empark Aparcamientos Extremadura S.L.

The cost or revenue derived from profits tax is the sum accrued under this item during the financial year, covering both
the cost or revenue of current tax and deferred tax.

Both the cost (revenue) derived from current and deferred taxes are recorded in the consolidated income statement.
However, the tax impact connected with items directly recorded in the consolidated statement of equity is
F-132ecognized within the equity.

Assets or liabilities based on current tax are valued for the sums expected to be paid to or recovered from the tax
authorities, employing the regulations in force or approved and pending publication at the date of closure of the
financial year.

Deferred taxes are calculated in accordance with the liability method, based on the temporary differences arising
between the taxable base sums of the assets and their book values. However, where deferred taxes are the result of
the initial recognition of an asset or a liability in a transaction other than a combination of businesses which, at the
time of the transaction, does not affect either the book result or the calculation base for the tax, they are not
F-132ecognized. Deferred tax is established by applying the regulations and taxation rates approved or about to be
approved at the date of the balance sheet, and which are expected to be applied when the corresponding asset
through deferred tax is F-132ecogniz or the deferred tax liability settled.

Assets by deferred taxes are F-132ecognized to the extent that it is considered probable that future taxable profits will
be made which could be used to compensate for temporary differences.

Deferred taxes are F-132ecognized in accordance with the temporary differences arising in investments in
subsidiaries and associated companies and joint businesses, except in those cases where the Company can control
the time of reversion of the temporary differences, and it is likewise probable that these will not revert in the
foreseeable future.


-----

consolidated corporate tax also includes other taxes such as taxes that encumber the repatriation of results as well as
any other tax that uses the accounted income as a basis for calculations.

The income tax expense reflected in the consolidated financial statements is calculated by aggregating the expense
registered for each company that belongs to the consolidated group, increased or decreased, as appropriate, by
elimination of accounting consolidation adjustments and by the differences arising between the taxable base sums of
the assets and liabilities and their book values in the Consolidated Annual Report (balance sheet method).

Deferred taxes are not recognized when the transaction has no effect on the accounting and/or fiscal value of the
involved assets or liabilities. In the case of business combinations, the corresponding deferred taxes derived from the
price assigning process and the fiscal F-133ecognizedF-133i of the generated goodwill in each case.

The assets and liabilities through deferred taxes are calculated at current taxation rates. At the date of the
consolidated income statement and which are foreseen to be applicable during the period in which the asset is
F-133ecogniz or the liability is settled. They are debited or credited to the income statement except when they refer to
items that are directly recorded as equity, in which case, they are accounted for as debit or credit to said accounts. By
non distributed profit of the subsidiaries, there is no liability by deferred taxes when the Group can control the
reversion of the temporary differences and it is not probable that these will be reverted in a foreseeable future. The
assets by deferred taxes and the tax credits derived from negative tax base sums are identified when it is probable
that the Group may recover these in the future regardless of the time in which they are recovered and always when
the recovery is prior to the legal period for usage. The assets and liabilities through deferred taxes are not deducted
and are classified as a non-current asset (liability) in the balance sheet. At each year-end, the F-133ecognized
deferred tax assets are reviewed.

_2.8.17 Conversion of foreign currency transactions_

The annual accounts of companies in foreign currency have been converted to euros using the closing exchange rate
method in accordance with the following rates:

**31/12/2012** **31/12/2012** **31/12/2011** **31/12/2011**

**Exchange Rate** **Average** **Closure** **Average** **Closure**

**euro/pound................................................................................................0.8257** 0.8161 0.8679 0.8353

**euro/Turkish lira ................................................................................................2.3992** 2.3551 2.3378 2.4432

_2.8.18 Recognition of revenue_

Revenue and expenses are attributed in accordance with the accrual principle, in other words based on when the true
value of the goods and services they represent becomes current, irrespective of when the monetary or financial value
arising from them is F-133ecogniz.

Revenue is recorded at the fair value of the consideration to be received and represents the sums receivable for
goods delivered and services provided within the ordinary course of the Group’s activities, less returns, rebates,
discounts and VAT.

The Group F-133ecognized revenue when the sum thereof can reliably be valued, it is probable that future economic
benefits will be received by the Group and specific conditions are met for each of the activities, as detailed below. The
sum of revenue is not deemed to be subject to reliable valuation until all contingencies connected with the sale have
been resolved. The Group bases its estimate on historical results, taking into consideration the type of client, the type
of transaction and the specific terms of each agreement.

a) The car park business may be divided into:

a.1) Off-street and mixed parking

a.2) On-street car parks (ORA)

a.3) Car parks for local residents

a.1) Off-street and mixed parking

Off-street car park revenues are recorded when the hourly parking rate is paid and, in the case of season ticketholders, on an accrual basis. Mixed car parks (with public and private spaces) record revenues as follows: in the case
of public spaces, in the manner described in the preceding paragraph; and in case of private spaces, the amount
received is recorded in the income statement at the time of the transfer of concession usage of the corresponding
parking spaces.


-----

date of the transfer of the concession of usage.

a.2) On-street parking (ORA)

Revenue from the ORA on-street car parks parking meter service is mainly based on the sum corresponding to the
cost of providing the service plus a percentage, generally between 1% and 3%, of the surplus between that cost and
the funds collected. In some ‘ORA’ on-street car parks contracts, revenue is obtained as a fixed percentage of the
take, to be paid by the Local Council. This is recorded in the accounts at the time when the service is provided.

a.3) Car parks for local residents

This business involves the construction of car parks whose spaces are sold directly to the end customer during the
timeframe of the concession. The sales and costs are not recorded until the parking space is delivered, which tends to
coincide with the signature of the contract, or exceptionally, the public deed of sale.

_2.8.19 Leases_

a) If any Group company is the lessee – Financial lease

The Group leases certain tangible fixed assets. Leases of tangible fixed assets where the Group substantially retains
the risks and benefits derived from ownership are classified as financial leases. Financial leases are
F-134ecognizedF-134 at the commencement of the lease at the fair value of the property leased, or the current value
of the minimum payments agreed under the lease, whichever is the lower. The calculation of current value is based on
the implicit interest rate of the contract, and if this cannot be established, the Group interest rate for similar operations.

Each lease payment is distributed between the liability and financial charges. The total financial charge is distributed
over the course of the lease and attributed to the consolidated statement of the financial year when it accrues,
applying the effective interest rate method. Contingent payments are recorded as a cost for the financial year when
incurred. The corresponding lease obligations, net of financial charges, are included in “Creditors through financial
leases”. Fixed assets acquired under a financial lease system depreciate during their useful life or the duration of the
contract, whichever is the lesser.

b) If any Group company is the lessee – Operating lease

Leases where the lessor retains a substantial part of the risks and benefits derived from ownership are classified as
operational leases. Payments under operational leases (net of any incentive received from the lesser) are charged to
the consolidated statement of the financial year when they accrue, on a linear basis over the period of the lease.

c) When the group is the lessor

Where assets are the leased under a financial lease arrangement, the current value of lease payments, discounted at
the implicit interest rate of the contract, is F-134ecognized as an item receivable. The difference between the gross
sum to be received and the current value of this sum, corresponding to interest not accrued, is attributed to the
consolidated statement of the financial year when that interest accrues, in accordance with the effective interest rate
method.

Where assets are leased under an operational lease arrangement, the asset is included in the consolidated statement
of the financial statement sheet in accordance with its nature. Revenue derived from the lease is F-134ecognized in a
linear manner over the course of the lease period.

_2.8.20 Redundancy compensation_

In accordance with current legislation, the Company is obliged to pay compensation to those employees who, under
certain circumstances, have their employment contracts terminated. Redundancy compensation payments which can
reasonably be quantified are recorded as an expense in the financial year in which a valid expectation exists, created
by the Company with regard to the third parties affected.

**3 Management of financial and currency risks**

The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including exchange rate risk, interest rate
risk and price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.

Risk management is controlled by the Senior Economic and Financial Management of Amsterdam, which identifies,
evaluates and pages financial risks in accordance with the policies approved by the Board of Directors. The
Administrative Board provides policies for overall risk management, and also for specific areas, such as exchange rate
risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, and use of derivative and non-derivative instruments and the investment of surplus
liquidity.


-----

order for the company to undertake its activities.

During the 2012 and 2011 financial years, the Company had in place bank guarantees with third parties and
guarantee commitments with other Group companies in order to engage in its business.

**_Market Risk: Exchange rate risk_**

Management has established an exchange rate risk management policy for foreign currencies other than the
operating currency. In order to manage the exchange rate risks derived from future commercial transactions and
F-135ecognized assets and liabilities, futures contracts negotiated by the Treasury Department are employed.
Exchange rate risk arises where future commercial transactions or F-135ecognized assets or liabilities are quoted in a
currency other than the F-135ecognizedF-135i’s operating currency.

**_Market Risk: Exchange rate risk from cash flows and fair value_**

As of 31 December 2012, if the interest rates on outside resources quoted in euros had been 50 basis points
higher/lower, with all other variables remaining constant, the result after taxes for the period would have been
(966)/966 thousands of euros lower/higher, mainly as a result of an increase/decrease in the cost of interest on
variable-rate loans.

The Group carries out the corresponding interest rate hedges by contacting an IRS (Interest Rate Swap). (See note
21).

**_Credit risk_**

Credit risk arising from cash and cash equivalents, financial derivative instruments and deposits held in banks and
financial institutions, along with wholesale and retail clients, including pending accounts receivable and committed
transactions. Regarding banks and financial institutions, only financial institutions that are known to be reputable and
solvent will be accepted.

**_Liquidity risk_**

Prudent management of liquidity risk involves holding sufficient cash and tradable securities, having access to finance
through a sufficient sum of agreed credit facilities and having the capacity to unwind market positions. Given the
dynamic type data from subjacent businesses, the object of the Group’s Treasury Department is to maintain the
flexibility in financing by the availability of credit lines.

**_Impairment tests_**

The Group undertakes an annual procedure in order to identify any possible deficit in the registered cost with regard to
the recoverable value of goodwill.

In the case of the goodwill of Empark Aparcamiento y Servicios S.A., Dornier S.A., Balsol 2001, S.A and Empark
Portugal-Empreendimentos e Exploraçao de parqueamentos S.A., this procedure is performed by F-139ecognize the
assets which were held by the Companies when they were acquired and which gave rise to the goodwill
F-139ecognized, these being the individual car parks.

Any possible impairment is calculated by comparing the value of these assets with their fair value, the latter
understood as the value of the future cash flow discounts which it is estimated that the assets will generate, based on
objective hypotheses, discounted at an estimated capital cost based on a risk-free rate using the 30-year bond as a
benchmark, and the level of risk of the asset, along with an estimated market premium.

A residual value is furthermore calculated, incorporating the renewal of the contract and growth.

In order to establish the present value of the future cash flows derived from the investment, the following hypotheses
were applied:

- It was established that the corresponding investment will generate flows over the periods up to maturity, of between
5 and 50 years depending on the concession.

- The corresponding revenue and expenditure forecasts were performed, in accordance with the following general
criteria:

    - In the case of revenue, in order to estimate the evolution of rates consideration was given to the official
forecast for the evolution of the consumer price index (CPI) in each of the countries where the investments
are operational (2.5% in both Spain and Portugal), the corresponding formulae for the adjustment of rates as
set out in the concession contracts, on the basis of the evolution of price indices and/or any specific correction
factors which may apply.

In the case of new contracts consideration was given to a ramp up in demand over the first 2 -5 years of the
concession in accordance with a specific analysis of each contract, followed by an estimate of evolution of
revenue similar to previous rates.


-----

evolution in the CPI rates (2.5% in both Spain and Portugal), in addition to the forecast evolution of the
business.

    - Consideration was also given to the impact of works to be performed in order to maintain and improve
infrastructure, based on the best estimate available according to the company’s experience, and taking into
consideration the forecast evolution of the business.

    - Consideration was given to the future costs and revenue corresponding to renewals of contracts and also the
investments required for these renewals on the basis of the investments occurring on previous contracts.

The renewal percentages employed in the different business lines (off-street, ORA on-street car parks,
management) were estimated at between 75% and 85%, based on the actual rates obtained by the Group.

    - The forecast cash flows obtained on the basis of the projected revenue and expenditure, in accordance with
the aforementioned criteria, were updated at the discount rate resulting from adding to the long-term cost of
money the risk premium assigned by the market to the country where the company performs its operations,
the risk premium assigned by the market to each business (both based on a long-term vision), along with the
financial Company and group companies of the company or cash-generating unit in question. The discount
rate employed was 8.24 %.

As a result of the impairment test performed, it has been revealed that the various cash-generating units to which the
various recorded sums of goodwill are assigned will serve to recover the net value of each of the sums recorded by
31 December 2012, and there is therefore no need to establish any form of impairment provision of any kind through
impairment, except for the endowment charged to reserves, amounting to (1,105) thousands of euros at Empark
Portugal-Empreendimentos e Exploraçao de Parqueamentos S.A. for the impairment occurring at the company Mr
Clean-Lavagem Veículos S.A.

A sensitivity analysis was also performed regarding reasonably possible changes in the key valuation variables (CPI,
inflation, discount rate, renewals…) with the recoverable value being maintained above the net book value.

syndicated loan. This novation involved a change to the F-156ecognizedF-156i calendar of all the facilities, without
any change to the nominal rate of the various facilities, or the spreads, or the maturity dates (the same conditions as
under the previous financing arrangement were maintained).

The costs associated with the novation of this loan were 3320 thousands of euros, considered as an amortised cost.
The cost was 75 basis points applied to the sum of the loan.

A comprehensive analysis of the new loan has been performed, essentially comprising:

- Calculation of the net present value of the previous financing and the new arrangement, based on the
corresponding drawdowns and F-156ecognizedF-156io (in the case of the new F-156ecognizedF-156i calendar,
the cost of 3320 thousands of euros was likewise taken into consideration, applying the weighted mean discount
rate for this financing.

- The discount rate employed was 6.67 %.

- The result of the study was a variation between the value of the previous and new financing arrangements of
0.46%.

As a result, following the analysis performed it was established that there was no substantial change in the loan
conditions. It was performed because the cost associated with the novation was accounted for as an amortised cost to
be deferred over the remaining lifespan of the loan.

This syndicated loan is referencing the Euribor, with a difference between 3.5% and 4.5%: Facility A 4%, Facility B
4.5%, TC1 4% and TC2 3.5% (see table below)

The total amount is divided into three different loans:

Facility A is an amortising loan payment of which began in 2011, and will expire in 2016. Under the new
F-156ecognizedF-156i calendar, aside from the half-yearly F-156ecognizedF-156io, there are three major
F-156ecognizedF-156io in December 2013, June 2015 and July 2016, the definitive maturity date.

Facility B was initially a bullet loan, with the sum total of the loan being amortised on maturity, in 2017. However,
following signature of the loan novation, F-156ecognizedF-156io were established in December 2013 and June 2015,
with a final F-156ecognizedF-156i in July 2017.

The Capex is divided into TC1 and TC2, the total amount is 72,000 thousands of euros, which can be made available
to pay for investments. As of 31 December 2011, 30,000 euros had been drawn down under TC1, and 42,000

_1 – Revenue generated by off-street car parks_

Revenue from off-street car parks corresponds to revenues generated through the use of parking spaces owned by
the Group or held under an administrative concession. Off-street car park revenues are recorded when the hourly
parking ticket is sold and, in the case of season ticket-holders, on an accrual basis.

_2 – Revenue generated by the sale of residents’ parking spaces_

This business involves the construction of car parks whose spaces are sold directly to the end customer during the
timeframe of the concession. The sales and costs are not recorded until the parking space is delivered, which
coincides with the signature of the contract.

_3 – Revenue generated by off-street car parks (ORA)_

Revenue from the ORA on-street car park parking meter service is mainly based on the sum corresponding to the cost
of providing the service plus a percentage, generally between 1% and 3%, of the surplus between that cost and the
funds collected. On some ORA on-street car park contracts, the revenue is earned at a fixed rate (service cost),
entirely irrespective of the funds collected, which are in all cases paid over to the Local Council. This is recorded in the
accounts at the time when the service is provided.


-----

The Group also F-176ecognizedF-176 in the provision of other services tied to the end-to-end management of car
parking and urban and inter-urban mobility, such as: Management of control of access to nature reserves, provision of
temporary parking services at trade fairs and mass attendance events, combined park and bus services around
airports.

**_c) Operating subsidies incorporated in the result_**

The result as of 31 December 2012 was 8 thousands of euros, while as of 31 December 2011 there were no operating
subsidies incorporated within the result.

**_d) Other non-recurrent operating expenses_**

During the 2012 financial year the Group undertook a process of F-176ecognizedF-176ion and
F-176ecognizedF-176ionF-176 affecting both the contract operation F-176ecognizedF-176i, through the application of
remote control criteria, F-176ecognizedF-176ion and the introduction of new technologies in contract administration;
and the central and peripheral structural F-176ecognizedF-176i, reducing the number of departments,
F-176ecognizedF-176i functions and processes, proceeding better to integrate the peripheral structure, etc.

This process is intended to adapt the Group to new market circumstances and the challenge of the intensive
application of new technologies in contract management.

As a result of implementation thereof during 2012, costs arose which will result in future savings improving the
Group’s operating margins.

We therefore considered these as a block of non-recurrent expenses, since they are either one-off or extraordinary
expenses, or are expenses which will not arise in the future.

The sum of these non-recurrent expenses amounts to (8,104) thousands of euros, breaking down as follows:

Personnel expenses corresponding to redundancy compensation and delays of agreements amounting to
(3,262) thousands of euros.

Personnel expenses which arose during the financial year but which will not arise in following financial years as a
result of the re-organisation and F-176ecognizedF-176ionF-176 process undertaken by the Group during the financial
year, amounting to (2,272) thousands of euros.

Expenses corresponding to signatures of new collective agreements with retroactive effect, amounting to
(731) thousands of euros.

External service expenses, essentially corresponding to structural and F-176ecognizedF-176ion savings, such as
leases, consultancy, etc. which will allow these costs not to be incurred in the future. The sum of these expenses
amounts to (1,839) thousands of euros.

With regard to non-recurrent operating revenue, this corresponds in its entirety (577 thousands of euros) to the
redemption of a concession by Cascais Local Council in Portugal.

During the 2011 financial year, the sum of non-recurrent expenses was (3,335) thousands of euros, essentially as a
result of invoices connected with tasks to prepare for issuance of a bond on the capital market, amounting to 1,862
thousands of euros, 282 thousands of euros through the F-176ecognizedF-176ion of the Sant Cugat fee for previous
financial years, 206 thousands of euros for invoices connected with technical consultancy studies and 985 thousands
of euros for compensation, of which 423 thousands of euros correspond to the company Empark Aparcamientos y
Servicios S.A, 473 thousands of euros to the company Dornier S.A, 5 thousands of euros to the company
Estacionamientos Guipuzcoanos S.L. and 84 thousands of euros to the company Empark Portugal-Empreendimentos
e Exploraçao de Parqueamentos S. A..

The main legal disputes in progress in 2012 were:

1.– Major Sum Proceedings brought by Obrascon Huarte Laín, S.A. against Ferrovial Aparcamientos, S.A. (now
Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A.) – Vista Desarrollo, S.A., Caixa Penedés, CARIPLO and Bolsa de Madrid
requesting that they cancel execution of the pledge of 850,614 shares in ESSA (now Empark Aparcamientos y
Servicios, S.A.).

A judgement upholding the arguments of Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A. and the other respondents has
been handed down, and this lawsuit must therefore be deemed to be concluded, following the Supreme Court
judgment of 10 December 2008. As costs were awarded against the plaintiff, Empark has filed three Cost Calculation
applications, claiming from Obrascón Huarte Laín, S.A. (OHL) for the payment of fees corresponding to Court Agents
and Lawyers. The only one pending judgment is currently before the Supreme Court, amounting to a sum of 224
thousands of euros. To date the sum claimed has been confirmed by the Clerk of the Court, and the case is awaiting
judgment.

On the other hand, Counsel Mr. Félix López Antón, who assumed the defence of Empark’s interests in different
instances of this proceeding, presented three proceedings for collecting legal fees against Empark claiming payment
of fees incurred for the 1st instance, the Provincial High Court and the Supreme Court. The situation regarding these
proceedings is as follows:

- First Instance: The fees have been established by the Court as a sum of 117 thousands of euros (plus VAT), from
which must be deducted the sum 54 thousands of euros (plus VAT) already previously paid by Empark to the
lawyer. The sum pending payment was therefore 63 thousands of euros (plus VAT), this sum having been lodged
with the Court on 17 September 2010. The interest calculated at a sum of 3 thousands of euros has also been
lodged. The costs of the claim proceedings must still be settled, valuation being pending.

The lawyer López Antón requested a record of various written submissions and rulings handed down in this appeal,
possibly in order to file these with the corresponding court bodies in order to establish any legal action which the
practice Despacho López Antón S.L.P. could bring against Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A., with these
declarations being issued by means of a Regulation Order dated 10 October 2011.

- Provincial High Court: The fees accruing at the Provincial High Court were initially set by the court itself at the sum
of 31 thousands of euros (including VAT), of which Empark had already previously paid 8 thousands of euros. The
invoicing lawyer nonetheless petitioned for this ruling to be struck down, claiming that there was a clear error in
application of the scale according to the Fee Standards of the Lawyers’ Association of Madrid. This nullification was
accepted by the High Court, with the fees ultimately being set at 47 thousands of euros (plus VAT), from which the
sum of 8 thousands of euros must be deducted. In other words, 39 thousands of euros (plus VAT). The entire sum
of the debt has now been lodged, and the VAT has been paid out of court, following presentation of the
corresponding invoice. The costs in the proceedings have not been valued.

The lawyer López Antón requested a record of various written submissions and rulings handed down in this appeal,
possibly in order to file these with the corresponding court bodies in order to establish any legal action which the
practice Despacho López Antón S.L.P. could bring against Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A., with these
declarations being issued by means of a Regulation Order dated 11 October 2011.


-----

sum 10 thousands of euros already previously paid by Empark would need to be deducted. The sum pending
payment (33 thousands of euros) has already been lodged by Empark. The invoicing lawyer petitioned for the
proceedings to be declared null and void. This position was not accepted by the Supreme Court, with a further
petition for clarification then being lodged. This was likewise rejected in a Ruling of 12 July 2011.

The practice Despacho López Antón Abogados SLP, as a result of the fees claimed for in the previous legal fee
claims proceedings, has also lodged a lawsuit under ordinary court proceedings, claiming for: (i) the part not settled
of the fees claimed for in the extraordinary procedural violation and cassation appeals (2901/2003), and which were
not F-182ecognized in the legal fee payment claim proceedings, amounting to 137 thousands of euros, plus the
corresponding VAT, and 15 euros of late-payment interest accruing, notwithstanding any which may subsequently
accrue up until payment of the debt; (ii) the late-payment interest accruing and not F-182ecognized by the
Provincial High Court of Madrid on the basis of the fees F-182ecognized in the legal fee claim proceedings, this
sum amounting to 2 thousands of euros. Notice of the lawsuit was served on Empark on 28 December 2011, the
response being submitted on 26 January 2012. The Preliminary Hearing was held on 4 June 2012, and the trial on
5 November 2012. P Judgment was handed down on 4 December 2012, rejecting the suit lodged by the legal
practice López Antón Abogados, S.L.P., with costs awarded against it.

Court of Madrid. Some days later we submitted our written challenge to the appeal. Pending judgment on appeal.

**_Contingent liabilities as of 31/12/11_**

The Group’s Directors are of the opinion that any liabilities not foreseen as of 31 December 2011 and which could be
based on the guarantees presented, should these occur, would not be significant.

As of 31 December 2011, the Group presented guarantees before Public Organisations for approximately 52,711
thousands of euros. The distribution thereof by group Company is essentially as follows:

- Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A. has lodged bonds amounting to approximately 22,665 thousands of euros,
essentially corresponding to those lodged with local councils granting concessions for the operation thereof, and
the obligations derived from contracts for execution and sale of developments, and various appeals lodged as a
result of disputes regarding municipal tax settlements.

- Dornier, S.A.U. had lodged bonds with third parties amounting to 6,778 thousands of euros, mainly lodged with
local councils to guarantee execution of the contracts awarded and various appeals lodged against certain
settlement calculations of municipal taxes.

- Estacionamientos Guipuzcoanos S.L.U. had lodged bonds of approximately 1,552 thousands of euros, mainly
involved in various appeals lodged against municipal tax settlement calculations, and those lodged with local
councils which have awarded the corresponding operational concessions.

- Femet, S.A. had lodged bonds with third parties amounting to 36 thousands of euros, mainly lodged with local
councils to guarantee execution of the contracts awarded.

- Aparcamientos de Bilbao, S.A. had definitive bonds granted by 860 thousands of euros, of which 513 thousands of
euros correspond to the award of the concession to operate the car park in Plaza de Indautxu and 347 thousands
of euros for the Azoka car park.

Local Council for the award of the concession to operate this Company’s car parks.

- Empark Portugal – Empreendimentos e Exploraçao de parqueamentos, S.A. had definitive bonds amounting to
3,389 thousands of euros, of which 584 thousands of euros are lodged with the Municipal Chamber of Faro, 288
thousands of euros with the Municipal Chamber of Lisbon, 75 thousands of euros with the Municipal Chamber of
Beja, 100 thousands of euros with the Municipal Chamber of Cascais, 125 thousands of euros with the Municipal
Chamber of Porto, 1,100 thousands of euros for the ANA contract, 1,022 thousands of euros with Milli Reasurants
T.A.S (Park Yonetimi Ve Sistemleri San. Ve Tic. A.S.).

- ESLI – Parques de Estacionamiento, S.A. had definitive bonds amounting to a sum of 1,355 thousands of euros, of
which 575 thousands of euros are: 172 thousands of euros with Repart. Finanças 4 Bº Fiscal Lisboa, 200
thousands of euros with the Municipal Chamber of Porto, 152 thousands of euros with the Direçao General do
Impostor, 134 thousands of euros with Lisbon City Council and 586 thousands of euros with the Municipal Chamber
of Lisbon.

The main legal disputes in progress in 2011 were:

1. – Major Sum Proceedings brought by Huarte, S.A. against Ferrovial Aparcamientos, S.A. (now Empark
Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A.) – Vista Desarrollo, S.A., Caixa Penedés, CARIPLO and Bolsa de Madrid requesting
that they cancel execution of the pledge of 850,614 shares in ESSA (now Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A.).

A judgement upholding the arguments of Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A. and the other respondents has
been handed down, and this lawsuit must therefore be deemed to be concluded, following the Supreme Court
judgment of 10 December 2008. As costs were awarded against the plaintiff, Empark has filed three Cost Calculation
applications, one at each instance, claiming from Obrascón Huarte Laín, S.A. (OHL) for the payment of fees
corresponding to Court Agents and Lawyers. The costs claimed are at First Instance: 145 thousands of euros. A
Decree has been issued by the Clark assessing the costs. This is within the voluntary payment period. The
proceedings have been concluded before the Provincial High Court, the costs claimed being 30 thousands of euros
(lawyer’s fees), which have already been paid by OHL (see note 34), and 3 thousands of euros (court agent’s fees),
which are pending payment. The costs claimed before the Supreme Court are 224 thousands of euros, which have
been confirmed by the Clerk of the Court, and the case is pending judgment.

In the Provincial High Court the petition lodged by Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A. was upheld,
acknowledging its entitlement to receive a total of 33 thousands of euros.

On the other hand, Counsel Mr. Félix López Antón, who assumed the defence of Empark’s interests in different
instances of this proceeding, presented three proceedings for collecting legal fees against Empark claiming payment
of fees incurred for the 1st instance, the Provincial High Court and the Supreme Court. The situation regarding these
proceedings is as follows:

- First Instance: The fees have been established by the Court as a sum of 117 thousands of euros (plus VAT), from
which must be deducted the sum 54 thousands of euros (plus VAT) already previously paid by Empark to the
lawyer. The sum pending payment was therefore 63 thousands of euros (plus VAT), this sum having been lodged
with the Court on 17 September 2010. The interest settled has also been deposited to the sum of 3 thousands of
euros. The costs of the claim proceedings must still be settled, valuation being pending.

The lawyer López Antón requested a record of various written submissions and rulings handed down in this appeal,
possibly in order to file these with the corresponding court bodies in order to establish any legal action which the
practice Despacho López Antón S.L.P. could bring against Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A., with these
declarations being issued by means of a Regulation Order dated 10 October 2011.

- Provincial High Court: The fees accrued before the Provincial High Court were initially established by said court at a
figure of 30 thousands of euros (including VAT), of which Empark had already previously paid 7 thousands of
euros. The invoicing lawyer nonetheless petitioned for this ruling to be struck down, claiming that there was a clear
error in application of the scale according to the Fee Standards of the Lawyers’ Association of Madrid. This decision
to strike down was accepted by the High Court, the fees ultimately being settled at a figure of 47 thousands of
euros (plus VAT) from which someone would have to subtract 8 thousands of euros. In other words, 40 thousands
of euros (plus VAT). The entire sum of the debt has now been lodged, and the VAT has been paid out of court,
following presentation of the corresponding invoice. The costs in the proceedings have not been valued.

The lawyer López Antón requested a record of various written submissions and rulings handed down in this appeal,

practice Despacho López Antón S.L.P. could bring against Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A., with these
declarations being issued by means of a Regulation Order dated 11 October 2011.

- Supreme Court: The fees were set by the Supreme Court at the sum of 44 thousands of euros (including VAT),
from which a sum 10,400 euros already previously paid by Empark would need to be deducted. The sum pending
payment (33 thousands of euros) has already been lodged by Empark. The invoicing lawyer petitioned for the
proceedings to be declared null and void. This position was not accepted by the Supreme Court, with a further
petition for clarification then being lodged. This was likewise rejected in a Ruling of 12 July 2011.

claims proceedings, has also lodged a lawsuit under ordinary court proceedings, claiming for: (i) that part of the fees
claimed and not settled in the extraordinary procedural violation and cassation appeals 2901/2003, and not
F-186ecognized in the accounts board examination, amounting to 137 thousands of euros, plus the corresponding
VAT, and 15,499.84 euros as claim proceedings interest accruing, notwithstanding any which may continue to accrue
up until payment of the debt; (ii) claim proceedings interest accruing and not F-186ecognized by the Provincial High
Court of Madrid, based on fees F-186ecognized in the accounts board examination, this sum amounting to 2
thousands of euros. Notice of the lawsuit was served on Empark on 28 December 2011, the response being submitted
on 26 January 2012. The Preliminary Hearing has been scheduled for 4 June 2012 at 11:45 h.

The outcome of the proceedings will substantially depend on the ruling reached in the cost evaluation procedure by
the Supreme Court, in which costs have been challenged by their OHL. We would therefore classify this risk as
moderate.

2.– Ordinary Proceedings 1041/2009, lodged before the Court of First Instance 5 of Santander by the UTE POMBO
joint venture, comprising CONSTRUCTORA OBRAS PÚBLICAS SAN EMETERIO, S.A. AND EXCAVACIONES SAIZ,

The purpose of the lawsuit is a claim for greater construction costs. The Judgment, upholding the lawsuit issued on

Provincial High Court. Nonetheless, the sum in question has already been paid to the UTE POMBO joint-venture.

3.– Ordinary Proceeding 370/2010 filed before Public Authority Litigation Court 3 of Pontevedra, brought by the

and any accruing between the lawsuit being lodged and the judgement handed down.

costs against it on the basis of reckless litigation. This judgement can be appealed before the Provincial High Court.

5.– Ordinary Court Proceedings 525/2011, brought before the Public Authority Litigation Court by the UTE Valls joint
venture comprising Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A., and CESPA Compañía Española de Servicios Públicos

ESTACIONAMIENTOS Y SERVICIOS, S.A. lodged an appeal, and Dornier, S.A. on 16 February 2010 submitted its
challenge to the appeal. On 6 June 2011 notice was served that a judgement had been handed down in the appeal,
upholding the appeal lodged by the appellant and striking down the agreed public authority contract award to
administer the public regulated on-street parking service in the city of Vigo, awarded to DORNIER. A request for a
clarification of the judgement has been presented and this is pending execution.

guarantees. The hearing was scheduled for 4 April at 2 p.m. On the date scheduled for the hearing, the Judge decided
that the proceedings should indeed be processed as ordinary proceedings, rather than a verbal hearing, specifically
because of the complexity of the issues raised. On 6 June 2011 a Regulatory Order was served for 26 May 2011,
indicating that the response to the lawsuit had been presented in due time and form, and scheduling the prior hearing
for 23 January 2012 at 12:30h. On the day of the preliminary hearing, this was suspended as the other party had not

In September 2009 the company submitted a written calculation estimating the damages caused by temporary
occupation, amounting to 286 thousands of euros.

In June 2010 the public authorities responded to this written calculation, claiming that the fair price in the case would
be a sum of 32 thousands of euros.

In September/October 2010 the company projected this public authority valuation, and petitioned for payment to it of
the concurrent sum. The aforementioned sum of 32 thousands of euros was collected in September 2011.

The case has been before the Provincial Expropriation Board of Girona since December 2010, pending resolution.

**Economic activity for the financial year**

Over the course of the 2012 financial year, the Company engaged in its business within an economic context

excellent management capacity, which has enabled the group to obtain a recurring EBITDA in 2012 EBITDA of 64,238

As for the Company’s financial risk management policy, this is based on the Group managing its capital in order to
guarantee that it will be in a position to continue operating as a profitable business, while maximising shareholder
return by striking an optimum balance between debt and equity.

Below are set out the main risks to which the Group is exposed:

- Liquidity risk: The Group establishes its treasury needs as part of its general policy through the use of two tools:
Treasury budget with a 12-month horizon, providing monthly detail and updates, and treasury budget with a 30-day
horizon, with daily updates and details. These tools identify treasury needs in volume and time, and make plans for
new financing needs.

- Credit risk: The Group maintains cash and equivalent liquid assets at financial institutions with a high-level credit
rating. It should furthermore be mentioned that there is no significant concentration of credit risk with third parties.

- Interest rate risk: Interest-rate risk affects the Group essentially through long-term outside resources. The Group
has contracted financial instruments that partially cover the risk of possible interest rate hikes.

- Exchange rate risk: The Group has no significant exchange rate risk, as most of its assets and liabilities, revenue
and expenses, are quoted in euros.

**Subsequent events**

There are no relevant events to point out.

**Research and development**

The Group has not carried out any research and development activities.

**Treasury stock**

There have been no acquisitions of own shares.

**Derivatives**

The Group has contracted financial instruments that partially cover the risk of possible interest rate hikes of long-term
outside resources.

**Environmental aspects**

Environmental activities are understood as covering any operation the main purpose of which is to prevent, reduce or
repair damage to the environment.

The investments derived from environmental activities are valued at the acquisition cost and are activated as greater
fixed asset expenses in the financial year in which they are incurred, following the criteria described in note 2
regarding applicable accounting standards.

Costs derived from the protection and improvement of the environment are attributed to the results for the financial
year in which they are incurred, irrespective of the point when the monetary or financial flow derived therefrom occurs.

The provisions relative to probable or certain responsibilities, legal proceedings in process and for compensation and
pending obligations of an undetermined amount, of an environmental nature not covered by contracted insurance
policies, are made when the liability or the obligation establishing the compensation becomes effective.

As of 31 December 2012, the costs or expenses incurred with regard to environmental aspects are insignificant.

As for any such potential contingencies as may arise in the field of the environment, the directors do not believe that
they would have any significant impact on the enclosed annual accounts.

the financial year ended on the aforementioned date. As stated in Explanatory Note 2 hereto attached, the directors of
the parent Company are responsible for drawing up the annual financial statements of the Group, in accordance with
the International Financial Reporting Standards adopted by the European Union, and all other provisions of the
financial reporting regulatory framework applicable to the Group. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
said annual accounts as a whole, based on the work performed in accordance with the current standards governing
accounts auditing in Spain, which require the examination, by performing selective tests, of the evidence in support of
the annual accounts and an evaluation of whether their presentation, the accounting principles and criteria applied and
the estimates made, comply with the applicable framework of financial reporting standards.

In our opinion, the consolidated annual financial statements for the 2011 financial year hereto attached express, in all
significant aspects, a true image of the consolidated net equity and consolidated financial situation of EMPARK
APARCAMIENTOS Y SERVICIOS, S.A. and dependent Companies at 31 December 2011, in addition to the
consolidated results of their operations and consolidated cash flows corresponding to the financial year ended on the
aforementioned date, in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards adopted by the European
Union and all other provisions of the financial reporting regulatory framework applicable to the Group.

The attached consolidated management’ report for 2011 contains the explanations that the directors of EMPARK
APARCAMIENTOS Y SERVICIOS, S.A. consider appropriate as to the situation of Group, the development of its
business and other matters, and does not form an integral part of the consolidated annual financial statements. We
have ascertained that the accounting information contained in the said management’ report corresponds to the
consolidated annual financial statements for 2011. Our task as auditors is limited to examining the consolidated
management’ report to the extent described in this paragraph and does not include a review of information other than
that obtained from the accounting records of EMPARK APARCAMIENTOS Y SERVICIOS, S.A. and its dependent
Companies.

## EMPARK Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A. and Subsidiaries

 Explanatory notes on 2011

**1 Group’s activities and consolidation scope**

**_1.1 Companies forming the Group and their business_**

The EMPARK Group, hereinafter the Group, comprises the dominant company Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios,
S.A., and its subsidiaries, joint businesses and associate companies. The registered company office is in Madrid at
address Plaza Manuel Gómez Moreno 2, ‘Edificio Alfredo Mahou’.

Through these companies, the Group engages in the following lines of business, which are its primary reporting
segments in accordance with IFRS 8.

Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A. previously named Cintra Aparcamientos, S.A. and prior to that named
Ferrovial Aparcamientos, S.A. and previously Ferrevisa, S.A., has as its main line of business the construction and
operation of car parks under public authority concession arrangements. Such concessions stipulate that, to fulfil the
concession timeframes, the car parks shall be returned to the granting entity in perfect conditions of use, without any
payment for provision of service for the Group. The Subsidiaries carry out the same activity as the Parent Company.

Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A., is the Parent Company of a group of 25 Dependent Companies, 5
Associates, has stakes in 4 JVs and 3 Companies as joint businesses.

For the purpose of drawing up the consolidated annual accounts, the assumption is that a group exists if the dominant
company has one or more dependent organisations, over which the dominant company exerts control either directly or
indirectly.

Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A., the dominant company of the Group, was incorporated in Madrid on 29 July
1986 as a public limited company. It is registered with the Company Register of Madrid, on sheet M-53866, page 86,
volume 14090, and section 8 of the Companies Book. The most recent adaptation and revision of its by-laws, based
on the Company Register of Madrid, is registered in volume 21897, book 0 of section 8, page 222, sheet M-53866,
and inscription no. 113.

All of the Group’s subsidiaries have the financial and tax year coinciding with the natural calendar year and none of
these are listed on the Stock Market. The scope of Consolidation is the following:

**_1.2 Changes in the scope_**

**31/12/11**

- The main changes in the scope of consolidation during financial year 2011 have been the following:

On 2 February 2011 a 100% stake was acquired in Victoria Service Project, S.L., a company incorporated on
25 January 2011. On 23 February 2011 it changed its company name to Empark Aparcamientos de Andalucía, S.L.U.
Subsequently, on 29 March 2011, Empark Aparcamientos de Andalucía, S.L.U. purchased the public authority
concession for the underground car park on Plaza San Agustín in Granada.

The company was not active at the time of its acquisition.

During 2011 the group sold the stake held by Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A. in Estacionamientos y
Servicios Extremeños, S.A. The value of the stake was 90 thousands of euros; it was sold for 330 thousands of euros,
which generated a profit of 240 thousands of euros.

Dissolution of the UTE Tenerife joint venture.

**31/12/10**

- The main changes in the scope of consolidation during financial year 2010 have been the following:

Dissolution of the companies Estacionamientos y Galería Comercial Indautxu, S.A., EMES EEM, UTE Lanzarote and
UTE T-4 Barajas.

**_1.3 Accounting Restatement_**

Below are detailed the main accounting restatements applied in the previous and current financial years, along with a
quantification of the impact of these accounting restatements on the company’s net equity.
The adjustments and reclassifications applied to the financial statements as of 01/01/2010 are detailed below:

The reclassifications applied by the Group were as follows:

1) Investments in concession projects

With the current restatement, if the concession-holding company has an unconditional right to receive cash or some
other financial asset, the concession agreement is classified as a financial asset, and must be classified within the
category of “Credits and items receivable”, although if the concession-holding company receives in consideration the
right to collect future tariffs on the basis of the level of usage of the public service, the concession agreement is
classified as an intangible fixed asset.

The Group does not have, and has therefore not reclassified, any concession agreement classified as a financial
asset from Tangible assets to non-current trade debtors based on the unconditional collection right with a maturity in
excess of one year and to trade debtors and other accounts receivable on the basis of that part of the unconditional
collection right maturing in the short term.

The Group has reclassified concession agreements classified as intangible assets from Tangible assets to intangible
assets.

consumption of a part of the infrastructure, are associated with the endowment of a systematic provision in
accordance with use of the infrastructure, up until the point at which the operations must be performed.

On the date of transition (01/01/2010), the Company analysed the operations to be performed in association with the
new criteria established, and proceeded to record a provision for replacement and major repair operations in
accordance with use, charged to reserves.

2) Access rights paid by means of a concession fee

Access rights paid by means of a concession fee during the concession period, and as a result where the standard
requires, irrespective of the applicable model, recognition of an intangible asset and a financial liability based on the
current value of all fees, excluding contingent payments.

If the Public Authority imposes a fee for the infrastructure access right by means of which the cost of construction is
transferred to the concession-holder, it may be concluded that, in essence, the situation is analogous, from the
financial perspective, to that which the concession-holding company would reveal if it had constructed or acquired the
infrastructure from third parties for subsequent handover to the Public Authority.

As a result, in such cases the infrastructure operator must recognise an asset and the corresponding liability on the
basis of the current value of the minimum payments agreed, without taking into consideration contingent payments.

The adjustments applied to the financial statements as of 01/01/2010 are detailed below:

Replacement provision:

On the date of transition (01/01/2010), the group analysed the operations to be performed in association with the new
criteria established, and proceeded to record a provision for replacement operations in accordance with use, charged
to reserves.

_Concession Fee:_

On the date of transition (01/01/2010), the Group transferred fees paid for operation of car parks to intangible assets
based on the current value of the minimum agreed payments, without taking into consideration contingent payments.

Concession agreements:

On the date of transition (01/01/2010), the Group performed a detailed study of those assets which should be within
the concession agreement, and so performed a reclassification of assets which were not within the agreement,
reclassifying these from intangible to tangible assets.

## EMPARK Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A. and Subsidiaries

 Explanatory notes on 2011 (continued)

**2 Summary of the main accounting principles**

**_2.1 Basis of presentation_**

The financial information listed in these annual reports has been drafted using the International Financial Reporting
Standards adopted by the European Union (IFRS-EU) and becomes effective at the closing if the financial year.
Regarding the methods used to apply these regulations, it is worth mentioning that the Group has opted, in cases
where the IFRS-EU allows different alternative criteria, to value the fixed and intangible assets at historical cost,
capitalizing financial costs during the construction period and for the case of jointly controlled companies and joint
ventures with existing companies, consolidate them using the proportional consolidation method. The Consolidated
Annual Reports have been prepared focussed on historic cost adjusted for the increase in value of the derivatives.
These criteria are the same ones applied in 2010.

The Group applied the IFRS-EU for the first time in financial year 2009 for drafting the consolidated financial
statements.

**_2.2 Accounting principles applied_**

_a) Standards and interpretations approved by the European Union, which are applicable to this financial year._

The accounting policies used for drafting the consolidated financial statements corresponding to the financial year
ended on 31 December 2011 are the same as the ones applied in the consolidated financial statements of the
financial year ended on 31 December 2010, except for the following standards and interpretations that are applicable
to the financial years beginning on 1 January 2011, to include:

- IAS 32 “Classification of rights issues”

This modification alters the definition of a financial liability in IAS 32, such that rights, options or warrants for the
purchase of a given number of the entity’s own asset instruments for a fixed sum in any currency will constitute equity
instruments if the entity offers these rights on a proportional basis to all current holders of its non- derivative equity
instruments in the same class. Application of this modification had no impact either of the financial position or the
results of the Group.

- IAS 24 “Related party disclosures”

This standard includes the following modifications: Clarification of the definition of a related party, including a partial
exemption for entities with a public stake, requiring that information be disclosed regarding balances and transactions
with such parties only if they are significant, taken individually or collectively. Application of these modifications had no
impact on the disclosures included in the intermediate consolidated financial statements.

- IFR IC 14 “Prepayments of a minimum funding requirement”

This modification applies in specific situations in which the company is required to make minimum annual
contributions in connection with its defined benefit post-employment plans and makes pre-payments to meet this
requirement. The amendment allows the company to consider the economic benefits which derive from the prepayments as an asset. The Group makes no minimum annual contributions to defined benefit plans, and the
application of these criteria thus had no impact on the financial position or results of the Group.

- IFR IC 19 “Extinguishing financial liabilities with equity instruments”

This interpretation provides that when the terms of a financial liability are negotiated with the creditor and it accepts
company equity instruments in settlement of the liability in whole or in part, the instruments issued are considered part
of the consideration settled for cancellation of the financial liability. Such equity instruments must be valued at their fair
value, unless this cannot be reliably estimated, in which case the valuation of the new instruments must reflect the fair
value of the financial liability settled, and the difference between the book value of the financial liability cancelled and
the initial value of the equity instrument issue is imputed to the income statement for the period. Application of the
criteria introduced by this new interpretation had no impact on the financial position or results of the Group.


-----

- Improvements to the IFRS (May 2010)

For the first time in May 2010, the IASB published amendments to the standards within the framework of annual
improvements for the purpose of eliminating inconsistencies and clarifying the standards, including specific transitional
provisions for each standard. The adoption of the following modifications represent a change in accounting policies,
although with no impact on the financial position on the results of the Group.

  - IFRS 3 Business combinations: The possible valuation options for external shareholders have been modified.
Only those components of external shareholders in the acquired party constituting current ownership stakes
entitling their holders to a proportional part of the net assets of the entity in the event of liquidation must be
valued either at their fair value or the proportional part which the current equity instruments represent out of the
sums of identifiable net assets recognised in the acquired party. All other external shareholder components are
valued at their fair value on the date of acquisition.

  - IFRS 7 Disclosures of financial instruments: The purpose of the modifications is to simplify the disclosures,
reducing the volume of disclosures regarding guarantees received and improving the disclosures, by providing
qualitative information in order to place the quantitative information in context.

The Group includes the required disclosures in note xx.

  - IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements: The modification clarifies that an analysis may be included of each
component of other comprehensive income in the statement of changes in net equity or in the notes on the
financial statements. The Group includes this analysis in note yy

  - IAS 34 Interim financial reporting: The modification requires inclusion in the interim condensed financial
statements of additional disclosures for the fair values and changes in the classification of financial assets, along
with changes in contingent assets and liabilities. The Group includes the required disclosures in note zz.

The improvements to the IFRS include other modifications to the following standards, although these represent no
change in the accounting policies, financial situation or returns of the Group.

  - IFRS 3 Business combinations: Clarification that the contingent price arising out of a combination of businesses
prior to the adoption of IFRS 3 (revised in 2008) is accounted for in accordance with IFRS 3 (2005).

  - IFRS 3 Business combinations: Clarification of the handling in accounts in a combination of businesses of
payment agreements based on shares of the acquiring party exchanged under agreements maintained with the
employees of the acquired party.

  - IAS 27 Consolidated and separate financial statements: Application of the transition requirements of IAS 27
(revised in 2008), as a result of the modified standards.

  - IFRIS IC 13 Customer loyalty programmes: In determining the fair value of reward credits, an entity must
consider the discounts and incentives which would be offered otherwise to clients not receiving reward credits.

_b) Standards and interpretations approved by the European Union, which must be forcefully applied to this financial_
_year._

The Group has not adopted any published standard, interpretation or amendment prior to it coming into effect. The
Group is evaluating the effect that the following amendment published by the IASB and approved by the European
Union, but not yet applicable, could have on the accounting policies, the financial statement or the Group’s results:

- Amendment to IFRS 7 “Disclosures – Transfers of financial assets”: Applicable to financial years beginning after
01 July 2011.

_c) Standards and interpretations published by the IASB and still not approved by the European Union_

At the date these consolidated financial statements were published, the following standards, modifications and
interpretations had been published by the IASB but were not required to be followed and had not been approved by
the EU:

- Amendment to IAS 12 “Deferred tax – Recovery of underlying assets”: Applicable to financial years beginning after
01 January 2012.

- Amendments to IAS 1 “Presentation of items of other comprehensive income”: Applicable to financial years
beginning after 01 July 2012.

- IFRS 9 “Financial instruments” and amendments to IFRS 9 and IFRS 7 “Mandatory effective date and transition
disclosures”: Applicable to financial years beginning after 01 January 2015.


-----

- IFRS 11 “Joint Arrangements”: Applicable to financial years beginning after 01 January 2013.

- IFRS 12 “Disclosure of interests in other entities”: Applicable to financial years beginning after 01 January 2013.

- IFRS 13 “Fair value measurement”: Applicable to financial years beginning after 01 January 2013.

- IAS 19 revised “Employee benefits”: Applicable to financial years beginning after 01 January 2013.

- IAS 27 revised “Separate Financial Statements”: Applicable to financial years beginning after 01 January 2013.

- IAS 28 revised “Investments in Associates and Joint Businesses”: Applicable to financial years beginning after
01 January 2013.

- IFR IC 20 “Stripping costs in the production phase of a surface mine”: Applicable to financial years beginning after
01 January 2013.

- Amendments to IAS 32 “Compensation of financial assets and financial liabilities”: Applicable to financial years
beginning after 01 January 2014.

- Amendments to IAS 7 “Disclosures – Compensation of financial assets and financial liabilities”: Applicable to
financial years beginning after 01 January 2013.

The Group is currently assessing the impact of applying these standards, modifications and interpretations. On the
basis of the analyses performed to date, the Group estimates that the application of these standards and modifications
during the initial period of application would have no significant impact on the consolidated financial statements,
except with regard to accounting for… (for example, if multi-group companies are accounted for under the proportional
method and will now be registered under the equity method)

**_2.3 Changes in Shareholders_**

During the 2011 financial year a capital increase amounting to 495 thousands of euros was undertaken, comprising
82,494 shares of a par value of 6.01 euros each. A share premium of 1,301 thousands of euros was in turn recorded,
at a rate of 15.77 euros for each of the 82,494 shares. ASSIP – Consultoria e Serviços, S.A. has subscribed in full the
82,494 shares, paying up the corresponding face value and the share premium by means of compensation of the
credit which it held against the Company.

The company had a credit amounting to 1800 thousands of euros in favour of ASSIP – Consultoria e Serviços, S.A.;
through the capital increase 1796 thousands of euros were compensated for (495 thousands of euros of capital
increase and 1,301 thousands of euros of share premium), with 4 thousands of euros remaining as of 31 December
2011. See (note 14)

**_2.4 Negative working capital and operating company_**

The Group has a negative working capital as of 31 December 2011 of (8,173) thousands of euros (28,331) thousands
of euros in 2010. This circumstance, which could be indicative of uncertainty regarding the continuance of operations
of the Group is mitigated by the fact that these types of situations are common in these types of groups where a large
part of the sales are received in cash.

The Group operates a centralised cash pooling system, by means of which Amsterdam handles cash requirements at
the group level.

Additionally, the group has lines of credit and other financial resources available for its treasury needs (note 21).

Therefore, the Board of Directors considers appropriate to prepare the annual reports based on the operating
company principle, which means the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities for the amounts and according to
how they are classified in the annual reports.

**_2.5 Accounting estimates and judgements_**

The information contained in these Consolidated Annual reports is the responsibility of the Group’s Board of Directors.
In the Consolidated Annual Reports for the financial years ended in 2011 and 2010 have been carried out using
estimates by the Group’s Board of Directors to value some of the assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and
commitments listed in them. These estimates essentially refer to:

- Evaluation of potential losses due to the impairment of certain assets.

- Useful life of material and intangible assets.

- Estimates related with the fair value of the assets purchased in business combinations and goodwill.

- Evaluation of possible contingencies due to legal and tax risks.

- Evaluation of the recovery of Assets through deferred taxes and Liabilities.

These estimates were carried using the best available information as of 31 December 2011 and 2010 regarding the
analyzed facts. However, it is possible that events that may occur in the future require modifying these estimates,
which would be carried out in accordance with IAS 8 if applicable.

**_2.6 Changes in Accounting Standards IFRIC 12_**

As indicated in note 2.2 (Applicable accounting standard), the current consolidated financial statements as of
31/12/2011 are the first considering the mandatory application of interpretation IFRIC 12 “Current Concession
Agreements” after it came into effect on 01/01/2010.

This interpretation regulates the accounting of public-private concession contract agreements for services provided by
the concessionaire, and in accordance with the agreements reached between the concessionaire and the awarding
authority, establishes the corresponding accounting methods that are to be followed.

IFRIC 12 affects public-private concession of services agreements when:

- The awarding authority controls or regulates what services the concessionaire must destine the infrastructure for, to
whom must the services be provided and at what price, and

- The awarding authority controls all significant residual stakes in the infrastructure at the end of the current
agreement.


-----

construction or improvement services on one hand and on the other hand, operation and maintenance services during
the period of the agreement.

Depending on the contractual rights received by the concessionaire as payment for providing infrastructure
construction or improvement services, the accounting methods will be the following:

_Intangible method_

Most of the companies under Empark Group affected by the application of IFRIC 12 (the great majority of car park
concessionaires) have had the intangible model applied to them. On a general basis, it is understood that said model
is applicable when the Concessionaire receives the right to charge a price to users for using the public service.

This right is not unconditional and depends on if the users are using the service; therefore the demand risk is
assumed by the concessionaire.

On the other hand we have the public service regulation concessionaires of the on-street parking where the price for
users is set by the awarding authority but the demand risk is assumed by the concessionaire.

In this case the valuation of the assets to be recognised (value of the concession or value of the right to collect from
users for the public service) as consideration for construction or infrastructure improvement services will be performed
in accordance with the terms of IAS 38 “Intangible assets”, being amortised over the lifespan of the concession. In this
regard, the application of IFRIC 12 essentially meant that those assets which had previously been recorded under the
caption “Tangible assets” and which must ultimately revert to the Grantor, are now recorded under the caption “Other
intangible assets: Public Authority Concessions”, being amortised on a straight-line basis in accordance with the
duration of the concession in years.

Likewise, within the applicability of IFRIC 12 framework, depending on the intangible model, future interventions,
which the Concessionaire must confront due to the use of the infrastructures for maintaining, re-establishing and
supplying them must be determined.

_Financial model_

The concessionaire identifies a financial asset within the scope of the unconditional contractual right to receive cash or
other financial asset of or under the management of whom is providing the construction services. In the Empark
Group, there is no case of a Concessionaire having this unconditional right.

The operator has the unconditional right to receive cash if the awarding authority contractually guarantees paying the
operator:

(a) specific or established amounts, or

(b) the deficit, if any, between the amounts received from public service users and the amounts specified or
established, even if payment is contingent on the operator, ensuring that the infrastructure meets the specified quality
or efficiency requirements.

The operator measures the financial asset at fair value.

**_2.7 Resource management policies_**

The Group manages its investments after having carried out an in depth examination and control of potentially
attractive projects from the environmental, socio-labour, commercial, financial and economic perspectives, for the
purpose of achieving a sustainable and balanced growth.

In carrying out this task, the Group’s shareholders want to be in a balance position regarding expected investment
profits and the assumed level of risk.

**_2.8 Consolidation policies_**

The dependent companies in which the Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A. Group holds a controlling stake have
been consolidated by means of the full consolidation method, unless they represent a relatively insignificant interest
with regard to a true image of Group Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A.

Group Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A. considers that control of a company is held if it has sufficient capacity
to establish its financial and operational policies, allowing it to obtain profits from its activities.

Those multi-group companies which Group Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A. administers jointly with other
companies have been consolidated on the basis of the proportional consolidation method.


-----

does have a significant influence, have been valued in the consolidated financial statement in accordance with the
equity method. For the purpose of drawing up these consolidated annual financial statements, it was deemed that a
significant influence was held at those companies where a stake of more than 20% in the capital stock is held, and it
can be demonstrated that such significant influence exists.

Note 1.1 to these consolidated annual financial statements sets out the details of the dependent, multi-group and
associated companies of Group Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A., along with the consolidation or valuation
method applied in drawing up these consolidated annual financial statements and other related information.

The date of close of the financial statements of the dependent, multi-group and associate companies is 31 December.
The accounting policies of these companies are the same or have been standardised with those employed by Group
Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A. in drawing up these consolidated annual financial statements.

The financial statements of each of the foreign companies have been prepared in their operational currency, this being
understood as the currency employed within the economic context in which each company operates, and in which
cash is generated and employed.

Group Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A. has been consolidated in accordance with the following principles:

**1. On the date when control is assumed, assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the subsidiary company are**
recorded at their market value. In the event of a positive difference between the cost of acquisition of the subsidiary
company and the market value of the stated assets and liabilities, this is recorded as goodwill, as it corresponds to
assets which cannot be separately identified and valued.

In the event of a negative difference, this is recorded against the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

The results of dependent companies acquired or disposed of during the financial year are included in the consolidated
statement of comprehensive income from the date of effect of the acquisition or up until the date of effect of disposal.

**2. Goodwill which comes to light in combinations of businesses is not amortised, although any possible impairment is**
examined annually.

**3. The result of valuing stakes on the basis of the equity method (following elimination of the results of operations**
between Group companies) is set out under the captions “Reserves of Companies under the equity method” and
“Stake in profits of companies under the equity method” on the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated
statement of comprehensive income, respectively.

**4. The value of the stake held by minority shareholders in the equity and income of dependent companies**
consolidated through full consolidation and those multi-group subsidiary companies consolidated through proportional
consolidation are presented, respectively, under the captions “Minority” under the liabilities on the consolidated
balance sheet and “Result attributed to Minority” on the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

**5. The results obtained in transactions for the purchase of shares from minority shareholders in companies over which**
control is exercised, along with the sale of shares without any loss of control, are charged or credited to reserves.

**6. The conversion of the financial statements of foreign companies has been performed in accordance with the rate of**
exchange at the close of year. This method comprises the conversion to euros of all assets, rights and obligations, by
applying the rate of exchange in force on the date of close of the consolidated annual financial statements and the
mean rate of exchange for the financial year for entries in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income,
maintaining equity at the historical rate of exchange on the date of acquisition thereof (or the mean rate of exchange
for the financial year when generated in the case of cumulative income, provided that there are no significant
operations which would make application of the mean rate of exchange inappropriate), as applicable. The resulting
conversion difference is imputed directly to reserves.

**7. All balances and transactions between companies consolidated by means of the full proportional consolidation**
method were eliminated in the consolidation process.

**Joint businesses and joint ventures**

A joint business is one in which operations are subject to joint control. Joint control is the contractual arrangement to
share control over an economic activity, and exists only if both financial and operational strategic decisions regarding
the activity require the unanimous consent of all parties sharing control.

Joint businesses are integrated within the consolidated annual financial statements by the proportional consolidation
method, and so include the portion of assets, liabilities, expenses and revenue corresponding to Group Empark
Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A.

**_Income Statement._**

_2.9.1 Intangible assets_

Tangible assets are initially valued at their cost, whether the price of acquisition or the cost of production. The cost of
intangible assets acquired by means of the combination of businesses is stated as the fair value on the date of
acquisition.

Following initial recognition, the intangible assets are valued at their cost, less the cumulative amortisation and, where
applicable, the cumulative sum of recorded impairment corrections.

a) Concessions

This section essentially includes the fees paid on certain concessions for the operation of car parks.

These administrative concessions are listed in the assets at their cost, less the cumulative amortisation and the
cumulative sum of acknowledged valuation corrections for impairment.

Concessions also include access rights paid by means of a concession fee during the period of the concession. In this
case the concessions are included under the assets at the current value of the minimum agreed payments, without
taking into consideration contingent payments.

The concessions are amortised on a linear basis over the period of the concession.

b) Computer applications

Licences acquired for computer programs from third parties are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred in
acquiring them and preparing the specific program for use.

The Company amortises its computer software on a linear basis, distributing the cost of the assets over the estimated
useful life of the same, which is three years.

The costs connected with the development or maintenance of computer programs are recognised as an expense
when they are incurred. The costs directly connected with the production of individual, identifiable computer programs
produced by the Group, provided that it is considered probable that they will generate economic benefits greater than
the costs for more than one year, are recognised as intangible assets. Direct costs include the cost of the personnel
developing the computer programs and an appropriate percentage of general costs.

_2.9.2. Tangible assets_

Tangible asset elements are recognised at their cost of acquisition, with the addition of the costs incurred up until their
operational start-up, less the cumulative amortisation and the cumulative sum of recognised losses.

The costs of the extension, modernisation or improvement of Tangible assets are incorporated within the asset as an
increase in its value only if they represent an increase in its capacity, productivity or an extension to its useful life, and
wherever it is possible to calculate or estimate the book value of the elements cancelled from the inventory having
been replaced.

The removal or disposal of any items is reflected in the accounts by eliminating the cost there of and the
corresponding cumulative amortisation.

The costs of major repairs are recorded as assets and amortised over the course of their estimated useful life, while
recurrent maintenance expenses are debited to the income statements during the financial year in which they occur.


-----

The amortisation of tangible assets, except for land, which is not amortised, is calculated in accordance with the
values of the updated cost, following the linear method based on the estimated useful life, in accordance with the
depreciation actually suffered through operation, usage and enjoyment. The estimated useful lifespans are:

**Estimated useful life**

Buildings and other construction................................................................................................................................ 50
Machinery, installations and tools ................................................................................................................................ 10
Furniture and fittings ............................................................................................................................................................10
Transport elements ..............................................................................................................................................................6
Other fixed assets ................................................................................................................................................................3

The car parks which are part of the tangible assets (in the caption “Buildings”) are valued at the acquisition price or at
the production cost, depreciated on a straight-line basis over the life of the concession.

Where the book value of an asset is greater than its estimated recoverable value, its value is reduced immediately
down to the recoverable sum.

The income and expenses from selling tangible assets are calculated by comparing the amount obtained by the sale
with the accounting value and are recorded in the income statement in the “Impairment and result through disposal of
fixed assets” caption.

The residual value and the useful life of the assets are reviewed, with adjustments made if necessary at the close of
each balance sheet.

At least at the close of the financial year, the need to perform valuation corrections based on impairment in value is
analysed

_2.9.3 Impairment losses_

In the case of goodwill, the group carries out annual value impairment tests. In the case of depreciable assets, at each
account close the Group assesses the existence of any loss in value that forces it to reduce the carrying amount . If
any loss indication is present, the recoverable value of the asset is calculated in order to identify the scope of the loss
by impairment in case its recoverable value is lower than its book value, and its effect is recorded in the income
statement. Impairment losses must be assessed for each individual asset. If this is not possible, the impairment loss is
determined for the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash flows independent of flows from other
assets (cash-generating units).

The recoverable amount is the higher of the market value (arms length value less associated costs) and the value in
use. The usage value is calculated from estimated future cash flows, discounted at a rate that reflects the present
market value, taking into account the value of money and specific risks associated with the asset.

_2.9.4 Interest costs_

Financial costs directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of fixed asset elements requiring a period of time
greater than one year in order to be fit for use are included in the cost until such time as the asset is in operational
condition.

_2.9.5 Financial assets_

a) Loans and items receivable:

Loans and items receivable are non-derivative financial assets with sums receivable which are fixed or can be
established and are not listed on an active market. These are included under current assets, except those with a
maturity date beyond twelve months from the date of the consolidated financial statement, which are classified as noncurrent assets. Loans and items receivable are included under “Corporate loans” and “Trade and other receivables”
on the balance sheet.

These are financial assets are initially valued at their fair value, and subsequently in accordance with their amortised
cost based on the effective rate of interest. Transaction costs directly attributable to their acquisition are recognised in
the consolidated income statement. On a quarterly basis, the necessary valuation corrections based on impairment in
value are applied, if there is any evidence that the entire sums owed will not be collected. The sum of the value
impairment loss is the difference between the book value of the asset and the value of the estimated future cash
flows, discounted at the effective rate of interest at the time of initial recognition. Any applicable valuation corrections
through impairment and reversion are recorded in the consolidated income statement.


-----

included under “Losses, impairment and variation in provisions through trade operations” in the consolidated income
statement.

The sums charged to the impairment account are normally cancelled once there is no expectation of more cash being
recovered.

The maximum exposure to credit risk on the date of submission of the information is the fair value of each of the
aforementioned categories of accounts receivable. The group maintains no guarantee as insurance.

b) Investments in the assets of group, multi-group and associated companies:

They are valued at their cost less, where applicable, the cumulative value of value impairment corrections. However,
where there is an investment made prior to the classification of a company as a Group, Multi-group or Associated
company, the cost of the investment is assumed to be its book value prior to such classification. Prior valuation
adjustments entered into the accounts directly under the net equity are maintained there until cancellation.

Investments in the assets of group and associated companies are included in the accounting records, under both
current assets and non-current.

The current assets include short-term investment in group and associated companies, comprising corporate loans and
other financial assets.

The non-current assets record the balance of long-term investments on group and associated companies, comprising
asset instruments. Asset instruments are broken down in the balances of holdings in group companies, holdings in
associated companies and share disbursements pending and not called on.

If there exists objective evidence that the book value is unrecoverable, the relevant valuation correction is applied as
the difference between the book value and the recoverable sum, the latter understood as whichever is the greater of
the fair value less the costs of sale and the current value of the future cash flows derived from the investment.

_2.9.6 Financial derivatives at fair value_

Derivatives are initially identified by their fair market value as of the contract date. The subsequent changes in market
value are recorded as well on each balance closing date. The method of identifying the profit and losses will depend
on if the instrument is designed as hedging or not and if it is, on the type of hedging. The different types of hedging
designated by the Group are the following:

i Cash flow hedge: Its purpose is to hedge the exposure to highly probable future transactions and variations in
cash flow. The gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recorded by the non efficient section f the Consolidated
Income Statement, while the efficient part is identified directly on the Equity of the Consolidated Financial
statement. The amount deferred in equity is not recognised in the consolidated income statement until the
transactions hedged are taken to the income settlement or until the maturity date of the transactions. This
recognition is carried out the same way as the results of the hedge item.

In the case of derivatives that do not qualify as hedge items, the loss or gain of said instrument are recorded in the
consolidated income statement.

_2.9.7 Business Combinations and Goodwill_

The business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition cost method, which entails recognizing the fair
value of the assets and liabilities identified in the acquired business. Goodwill is the positive difference between the
cost of an investment and the value of the aforementioned assets and liabilities. In the acquisitions of subsidiaries, the
goodwill that is generated is considered as greater value of the share. The consolidated goodwill does not depreciate
and is subject to the impairment test (note 6).

Goodwill is assigned to cash generating units for the purpose of performing impairment loss tests. This allocation is
made to those cash generating units expected to benefit from the merger of businesses during which the goodwill
arose.

_2.9.8 Stock_

Stock is valued at its cost or its net realisable value, whichever is the lower. The cost of stock is established by
application of the weighted average cost principle.

The cost of the finished products and products in progress correspond to construction in progress and completed, and
include the costs incurred in construction of car parking destined to concession of usage.


-----

If the cost is greater than the market value, the relevant valuation corrections are applied, and are recognised as an
expense in the profit and loss account. If the circumstances leading to the value correction cease to exist, the sum of
the correction is subject to reversion and is recognised as revenue in the consolidated income statement.

_2.9.9 Cash and other equivalent liquid assets_

Cash and other equivalent liquid assets include cash on hand, demand deposits at banks, and short term, high liquid
investments which initially have a maturity of three months or less and are not subject to a significant risk of changes
in value.

This section includes the short term restricted cash flow. This concept collects the investments of the same nature and
maturity affected by financing of specific infrastructure projects, whose availability is restricted by financing contracts
as guarantee to cover specific short term obligations relative to interests or principle of the debt as well as for the
future maintenance of the infrastructure.

_2.9.10 Net equity_

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are
presented in equity as a deduction, net of taxes. The purchasing of Parent Company shares by consideration paid,
including attributed associated costs are deducted from the equity. When these shares are sold or subsequently
reissued, any amount received net of costs includes the equity.

The basic profit by action is calculated as the quotient between the net profits attributed to the parent company and
the average weighted number of ordinary shares in circulation during said period. In turn, the diluted profit by action is
calculated as the quotient between the net incomes attributed to the ordinary shareholders and the average weighted
number of ordinary shares in circulation during said period.

In the case that the Group’s consolidated Annual Accounts correspond with the financial years ended on
31 December 2010 and 2011; the basic profits by action coincide with the diluted.

_2.9.11 Provisions for employees_

a) Pensions commitment:

Fixed provision pension plans

Pension plans which are not classified as fixed contribution plans are deemed as fixed provision arrangements. In
general, fixed provision plans establish the sum of the provision to be received by the employee at the time of
retirement, normally in accordance with one or more factors, such as age, years of service and remuneration.

The Group recognises in its balance sheet a provision for fixed provision pension plans based on the difference
between the current value of the committed remunerations and the fair value of any possible assets subject to
commitments which are to be used to settle the obligations, with any appropriate deduction being made in accordance
with the sum of the costs of past services not yet recognised.

If the above difference gives rise to an asset, the value placed on this may not be greater than the current value of the
provisions which may be returned to the Group in the form of direct reimbursements or reduced future contributions
plus, where applicable, the part pending allocation to results through costs for past services. Any adjustment which the
Group may be required to make on the basis of this limit in the valuation of the assets is attributed directly to the net
equity, being recognised as reserves.

The current value of the obligation is established by means of actuarial calculation methods and financial and actuarial
hypotheses which are unbiased and mutually compatible.

Any variation in calculation of the current value of the committed remunerations or, as applicable, the corresponding
assets, at the date of close, as a result of actuarial profits and losses, is recognised in the financial year during which it
arises, recorded directly in the net equity as reserves. For these purposes, profits and losses cover only variations
arising through changes in actuarial hypotheses or adjustments based on experience.

Costs of past services are recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement, except in the case of
revocable rights, in which case they are attributed to the consolidated income statement on a linear basis over the
remaining period up until the rights based on past services become irrevocable. However, if an asset is derived, the
revocable rights are attributed to the income statement immediately, unless a reduction occurs in the current value of
the provisions which may be returned to the Group in the form of direct reimbursement or reduced future contributions,
in which case the excess above this reduction is attributed immediately to the consolidated income statement.


-----

At 31 December 2011 and 2010 there were 76, 25 and 3 people with which the companies Empark Aparcamientos y
Servicios, S.A., Dornier, S.A.U. and Balsol 2001, S.A. respectively had retirement commitments in this regard. These
commitments are not significant.

b) Redundancy compensation:

Redundancy compensation is paid to employees as a result of a decision by the Group to terminate their employment
contracts prior to the normal retirement age, or if the employee agrees to retire voluntarily in exchange for such
provisions. The Group recognises these provisions when a proven commitment has been agreed for the termination of
the employment of workers, in accordance with a detailed, formal plan, with no possible withdrawal, or an agreement
has been reached to provide redundancy compensation as a result of an offer made in order to encourage voluntary
redundancies. Those provisions which are not to be paid within 12 months of the date of the balance sheet are
discounted at their current value.

_2.9.12 Transactions among related parties_

In general, operations among related parties are accounted for at the initial point at their fair value. In any case, if the
agreed price differs from the fair value, the difference is recorded in accordance with the economic reality of the
operation. The subsequent valuation is made in accordance with the terms set out in the corresponding regulations.

_2.9.13 Subsidies_

A subsidy is considered not refundable when there is an individual concession agreement for the subsidy, all the
conditions for its concession have been met and there are no reasonable doubts that payment will be collected.

The monetary type subsidies are valued using the fair value of the awarded amount.

_2.9.14 Provisions and contingent liabilities_

Provisions for contingencies and expenses are accounted for in accordance with the estimated amount required to
deal with probable or certain responsibilities, legal proceedings in progress and for compensation and pending
obligations of an undetermined amount, guarantees or other similar sureties.

Provisions are recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present obligation, either legal or implicit, as a
result of past events, where it is deemed probable that this will involve the need for outgoing resources for settlement,
and the sum can be estimated in a reliable manner.

Provisions are valued at the current value of the disbursements which are expected to be required in order to settle
the obligation, using a pre-tax rate which reflects the opinions of the current market as to the temporary value of
money and the specific risks of the obligation. Adjustments in the provision based on any updates are recognised as a
financial expense as they gradually accrue.

Provisions maturing within one year or less and with an insignificant financial impact are not discounted.

Contingent liabilities are possible obligations arising as a result of past events, the materialisation of which depends
on whether or not one or more future events should occur, outside the control of the Group.

Given the activities in which the Group is currently engaged, it has no liabilities, expenses, assets or provisions and
contingencies of an environmental nature which could prove significant with reference to its net equity, its financial
situation and its results. Hence, specific breakdowns are not included in the report herein on the consolidated annual
accounts with regards information on environmental issues.

Costs derived from the protection and improvements of the environment are attributed to the consolidated results for
the financial year in which they are incurred, irrespective of the point when the monetary or financial flow derived there
from occurs.

When such expenses involve the acquisition of tangible assets the purpose of which is to minimise environmental
impact and to protect and improve the environment, these are included in the accounts as an increase in the value of
fixed assets.

_2.9.15 Financial liabilities_

Debts and items payable

These liabilities are initially carried at the fair net value of the expenses incurred in the transaction, subsequently
recording these by their depreciated cost according to the effective interest method. The effective interest rate is the


-----

that the effective interest rate is initially considered different from the market interest, the liability is valued taking into
account the actual value of the future flows at that market rate in the case of loans with set interest rates. If said
interest rate is not fulfilled, the valuation of these is also carried out at the aforementioned market interest rate.

In the event of a renegotiation of existing debts, it is considered that no substantial modification has occurred to the
financial liability if the lender of the new loan is the same as that which granted the initial loan and the current value of
the cash flows, including the associated issuance and execution costs using the effective interest method, varies by
no more than 10% from the current value of the cash flows pending payment on the original liability, calculated in
accordance with this same method.

_2.9.16 Income tax and deferred taxes_

The Group has since 1 January 2005 paid attacks under the consolidated taxation system at Cintra Concesiones de
Infraestructuras de Transporte, S.A., as a result of the change in ownership which occurred in 2004, following which
the Dominant Company fell within the aforementioned tax consolidation perimeter. The group previously paid taxes
under the consolidated taxation system as part of the Ferrovial, S.A. Group. During 2009, as a result of the sale
transaction referred to in Note 31, the Group left the aforementioned tax system, and on 31 December 2009 the
company applied to pay taxes as a tax group, with effect from 1 January 2010. This group comprises the following
companies:

- Empark, Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A.

- Dornier, S.A.U.

- Femet, S.A.

- Guadianapark, S.A.

- Balsol 2001, S.A.

- Estacionamientos Guipuzcoanos, S.L.U.

The cost or revenue derived from profits tax is the sum accrued under this item during the financial year, covering both
the cost or revenue of current tax and deferred tax.

Both the cost (revenue) derived from current and deferred taxes are recorded in the consolidated income statement.
However, the tax impact connected with items directly recorded in the consolidated statement of net equity is
recognised within the net equity.

Assets or liabilities based on current tax are valued for the sums expected to be paid to or recovered from the tax
authorities, employing the regulations in force or approved and pending publication at the date of close of the financial
year.

Deferred taxes are calculated in accordance with the liability method, based on the temporary differences arising
between the taxable base sums of the assets and their book values. However, where deferred taxes are the result of
the initial recognition of an asset or a liability in a transaction other than a combination of businesses which, at the
time of the transaction, does not affect either the book result or the calculation base for the tax, they are not
recognised. Deferred tax is established by applying the regulations and taxation rates approved or about to be
approved at the date of the balance sheet, and which are expected to be applied when the corresponding asset
through deferred tax is realised or the deferred tax liability settled.

Assets through deferred taxes are recognised to the extent that it is considered probable that future taxable profits will
be made which could be used to compensate for temporary differences.

Deferred taxes are recognised in accordance with the temporary differences arising in investments in subsidiaries and
associated companies and joint businesses, except in those cases where the Company can control the time of
reversion of the temporary differences, and it is likewise probable that these will not revert in the foreseeable future.

The term consolidated corporate taxes includes all taxes, national and foreign, related to profits subject to tax. The
consolidated corporate tax also includes other taxes such as taxes that encumber the repatriation of results as well as
any other tax that uses the accounted income as a basis for calculations.

The corporation tax expense reflected in the consolidated financial statements is calculated by aggregating the
expense registered for each company that belongs to the consolidated group, increased or decreased, as appropriate,
by elimination of accounting consolidation adjustments and by the differences arising between the taxable base sums
of the assets and liabilities and their book values in the consolidated annual financial statements (balance sheet
method).


-----

involved assets or liabilities. In the case of business combinations, the corresponding deferred taxes derived from the
price assigning process and the fiscal amortisation of the generated goodwill in each case.

The assets and liabilities through deferred taxes are calculated at current taxation rates. At the date of the
consolidated income statement and which are foreseen to be applicable during the period in which the asset is
realised or the liability is settled. They are debited or credited to the income statement except when they refer to items
that are directly recorded as net equity, in which case, they are accounted for as debit or credit to said accounts. By
non distributed profit of the subsidiaries, there is no liability by deferred taxes when the Group can control the
reversion of the temporary differences and it is not probable that these will be reverted in a foreseeable future. The
assets by deferred taxes and the tax credits derived from negative tax base sums are identified when it is probable
that the Group may recover these in the future regardless of the time in which they are recovered and always when
the recovery is prior to the legal period for usage. The assets and liabilities through deferred taxes are not deducted
and are classified as a non-current asset (liability) in the balance sheet. At each year-end, the recognised Assets
through deferred taxes are reviewed.

_2.9.17 Conversion of foreign currency transactions_

The annual accounts of companies in foreign currency have been converted to euros using the closing exchange rate
method in accordance with the following rates:

**31/12/2011** **31/12/2011** **31/12/2010** **31/12/2010**

**Exchange Rate** **Average** **Closure** **Average** **Closure**

**euro/pound................................................................................................0.8679** 0.8353 0.8561 0.8574

**euro/Turkish lira ................................................................................................2.3378** 2.4432 2.0491 2.0560

_2.9.18 Recognition of revenue_

Revenue and expenses are attributed in accordance with the accrual principle, in other words based on when the true
value of the goods and services they represent becomes current, irrespective of when the monetary or financial value
arising from them is realised.

Revenue is recorded at the fair value of the consideration to be received and represents the sums receivable for
goods delivered and services provided within the ordinary course of the Group’s activities, less returns, rebates,
discounts and VAT.

The Group recognises revenue when the sum thereof can reliably be valued, it is probable that future economic
benefits will be received by the Group and specific conditions are met for each of the activities, as detailed below. The
sum of revenue is not deemed to be subject to reliable valuation until all contingencies connected with the sale have
been resolved. The Group bases its estimate on historical results, taking into consideration the type of client, the type
of transaction and the specific terms of each agreement.

**a) The car park business may be divided into:**

a.1) Off-street and mixed parking

a.2) On-street parking (ORA)

a.3) Car parks for local residents

a.1) Off-street and mixed parking

Off-street car park revenues are recorded when the hourly parking rate is paid and, in the case of season ticketholders, on an accrual basis. Mixed car parks (with public and private spaces) record revenues as follows: in the case
of public spaces, in the manner described in the preceding paragraph; and in case of private spaces, the amount
received is recorded in the income statement at the time of the transfer of concession usage of the corresponding
parking spaces .

Regarding the public spaces, these are recorded in inventories and are transcribed to the income statement on the
date of the transfer of the concession of usage.

a.2) On-street parking (ORA)

Revenue from the ORA parking meter service is mainly based on the sum corresponding to the cost of providing the
service plus a percentage, generally between 1% and 3%, of the surplus between that cost and the funds collected. In


-----

Council. This is recorded in the accounts at the time when the service is provided.

a.3) Car parks for local residents

This business involves the construction of car parks whose spaces are sold directly to the end customer during the
timeframe of the concession. The sales and costs are not recorded until the parking space is delivered, which tends to
coincide with the signature of the contract, or exceptionally, the public deed of sale.

_2.9.19 Leases_

a) If any Group company is the lessee – Financial lease

The Group leases certain Tangible assets. Leases of Tangible assets where the Group substantially retains the risks
and benefits derived from ownership are classified as financial leases. Financial leases are capitalised at the
commencement of the lease at the fair value of the property leased, or the current value of the minimum payments
agreed under the lease, whichever is the lower. The calculation of current value is based on the implicit interest rate of
the contract, and if this cannot be established, the Group interest rate for similar operations.

Each lease payment is distributed between the liability and financial charges. The total financial charge is distributed
over the course of the lease and attributed to the consolidated statement of the financial year when it accrues,
applying the effective interest rate method. Contingent payments are recorded as a cost for the financial year when
incurred . The corresponding lease obligations, net of financial charges, are included in “Creditors through financial
leases”. Fixed assets acquired under a financial lease system depreciate during their useful life or the duration of the
contract, whichever is the lesser.

b) If any Group company is the lessee – Operating lease

Leases where the lessor retains a substantial part of the risks and benefits derived from ownership are classified as
operational leases. Payments under operational leases (net of any incentive received from the lesser) are charged to
the consolidated statement of the financial year when they accrue, on a linear basis over the period of the lease.

c) When the Group is the lessor

Where assets are the leased under a financial lease arrangement, the current value of lease payments, discounted at
the implicit interest rate of the contract, is recognised as an item receivable. The difference between the gross sum to
be received and the current value of this sum, corresponding to interest not accrued, is attributed to the consolidated
statement of the financial year when that interest accrues, in accordance with the effective interest rate method.

Where assets are leased under an operational lease arrangement, the asset is included in the consolidated statement
of the financial statement sheet in accordance with its nature. Revenue derived from the lease is recognised in a linear
manner over the course of the lease period.

_2.9.20 Redundancy compensation_

In accordance with current legislation, the Company is obliged to pay compensation to those employees who, under
certain circumstances, have their employment contracts terminated. Redundancy compensation payments which can
reasonably be quantified are recorded as an expense in the financial year in which a valid expectation exists, created
by the Company with regard to the third parties affected.

**3 Management of financial and currency risks**

The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including exchange rate risk, interest rate
risk and price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.


-----

Risk management is controlled by the Senior Economic and Financial Management of Amsterdam, which identifies,
evaluates and pages financial risks in accordance with the policies approved by the Board of Directors. The
Administrative Board provides policies for overall risk management, and also for specific areas, such as exchange rate
risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, and use of derivative and non-derivative instruments and the investment of surplus
liquidity.

The financial risks to which the Company is exposed include those derived from the guarantees and bonds required in
order for the company to undertake its activities.

During the 2010 and 2011 financial years, the Company had in place bank guarantees with third parties and
guarantee commitments with other Group companies in order to engage in its business.

**_Market Risk: Exchange rate risk from cash flows and fair value_**

At 31 December 2011, if the interest rates on outside resources quoted in euros had been 50 basis points
higher/lower, with all other variables remaining constant, the result after taxes for the period would have been
(1,183)/1,183 thousands of euros lower/higher, mainly as a result of an increase/decrease in the cost of interest on
variable-rate loans.

The Group carries out the corresponding interest rate hedges by contacting an IRS (Interest Rate Swap). (See note
21).

**_Credit risk_**

Credit risk is handled by groups. Credit risk arising from cash and cash equivalents and deposits held in banks and
financial institutions, along with wholesale and retail clients, including pending accounts receivable and committed
transactions. Regarding banks and financial institutions, only financial institutions that are known to be reputable and
solvent will be accepted.

**_Liquidity risk_**

Prudent management of liquidity risk involves holding sufficient cash and tradable securities, having access to finance
through a sufficient sum of agreed credit facilities and having the capacity to unwind market positions. Given the
dynamic type data from subjacent businesses, the object of the Group’s treasury Department is to maintain the
flexibility in financing by the availability of lines.

**_Impairment tests_**

The Group undertakes an annual procedure in order to identify any possible deficit in the registered cost with regard to
the recoverable value of goodwill.

In the case of the goodwill of Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A. and Balsol 2001, S.A., and this procedure is
performed by analysing the assets available to the company at the time of its acquisition and which gave rise to the
recognised goodwill, these being individual car parks.

Any possible impairment is calculated by comparing the value of these assets with their fair value, the latter
understood as the value of the future cash flow discounts which it is estimated that the assets will generate, based on
objective hypotheses, discounted at an estimated capital cost based on a risk-free rate using the 30-year bond as a
benchmark, and the level of risk of the asset, along with an estimated market premium.

A residual value is furthermore calculated, incorporating the renewal of the contract and growth.

In the case of Dornier SAU, the goodwill corresponding to the Group as a whole is analysed, this being the
corresponding cash generating unit.

Any possible impairment is calculated by comparing the Group’s book value (shareholder equity plus value of net
goodwill) with its fair value, the latter understood as the price for which it could be sold between independent parties,
less any possible costs tied to such a sale, and provided that this fair value can be estimated in a reliable manner, in
other words if the Group in which the stake is held is actively listed on an organised financial market, or there exists
some transaction between independent parties which could serve as a benchmark; a residual value is furthermore
calculated, incorporating the renewal of the contract and growth.

In order to establish the current value of future cash flows derived from the investment, the following process was
performed:

- The timeframe over which it is estimated that the corresponding investment will generate flows (concession period)
is established. In most cases this period extends up to the expiry thereof: between 10 and 30 years.

- The corresponding revenue and expenditure forecasts were performed, in accordance with the following general
criteria:

  - In the case of revenue, in order to estimate the evolution of rates consideration was given to the official forecast
for the evolution of the consumer price index (CPI) in each of the countries where the investments are
operational, the corresponding formulae for the adjustment of rates as set out in the concession contracts, on the
basis of the evolution of price indices and/or any specific correction factors which may apply.

  - In terms of expenditure, the evolution thereof was calculated on the basis of the corresponding expected
evolution in the CPI rates, in addition to the forecast evolution of the business.

  - Consideration is also given to the impact of works to be performed in order to maintain and improve
infrastructure, based on the best estimate available according to the company’s experience, and taking into
consideration the forecast evolution of the business.

- The forecast cash flows obtained on the basis of the projected revenue and expenditure, in accordance with the
aforementioned criteria, were updated at the discount rate resulting from adding to the long-term cost of money the
risk premium assigned by the market to the country where the company performs its operations, the risk premium
assigned by the market to each business (both based on a long-term vision), along with the financial structure of
the company or cash-generating unit in question. The discount rate employed was 8.24%

As a result of the impairment test performed, it has been revealed that the various cash-generating units to which the
various recorded sums of goodwill are assigned will serve to recover the net value of each of the sums recorded by
31 December 2011, and there is therefore no need to establish any form of impairment provision.

The main legal disputes in progress in 2011 were:

1.- Major Sum Proceedings brought by Huarte, S.A. against Ferrovial Aparcamientos, S.A. (now Empark
Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A.) – Vista Desarrollo, S.A., Caixa Penedés, CARIPLO and Bolsa de Madrid requesting
that they cancel execution of the pledge of 850,614 shares in ESSA (now Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A.).

A judgement upholding the arguments of Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A. and the other respondents has
been handed down, and this lawsuit must therefore be deemed to be concluded, following the Supreme Court
judgment of 10 December 2008. As costs were awarded against the plaintiff, Empark has filed three Cost Calculation
applications, one at each instance, claiming from Obrascón Huarte Laín, (OHL) the payment of fees corresponding to
Court Agents and Lawyers. The costs claimed are at First Instance: 145 thousands of euros. A Decree has been
issued by the Clark assessing the costs. This is within the voluntary payment period. The proceedings have concluded
at the Provincial High Court, the costs claimed being 30 thousands of euros (lawyer’s fees), which have already been
paid by OHL (see note 34), and 3 thousands of euros (court agent fees), which are pending payment. In the Supreme
Court the costs claimed are 224 thousands of euros, as confirmed by the Clerk of the Court, pending resolution by the
Judges.

In the Provincial High Court the petition lodged by Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A. was upheld,
acknowledging its entitlement to receive a total of 33 thousands of euros.

On the other hand, Counsel Mr. Félix López Antón, who assumed the defence of Empark’s interests in different
instances of this proceeding, presented three proceedings for collecting legal fees against Empark claiming payment
of fees incurred for the 1st instance, the Provincial High Court and the Supreme Court. The situation regarding these
proceedings is as follows:

- First Instance: The fees have been set by the Court at the sum of 117 thousands of euros (including VAT), from
which must be deducted the sum of 54 thousands of euros already paid by Empark to the lawyer. The sum pending
payment was therefore 73 thousands of euros, this sum having been lodged with the Court on 17 September 2010.
The interest calculated at a sum of 3 thousands of euros has also been lodged. The costs of the claim proceedings
must still be settled, valuation being pending.


-----

The lawyer López Antón requested a record of various written submissions and rulings handed down in this appeal,
possibly in order to file these with the corresponding court bodies in order to establish any legal action which the
practice Despacho López Antón S.L.P. could bring against Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A., with these
declarations being issued by means of a Regulation Order dated 10 October 2011.

- Provincial High Court: The fees accruing at the Provincial High Court were initially set by the court itself at the sum
of 30 thousands of euros (including VAT), of which Empark had already previously paid 7 thousands of euros. The
invoicing lawyer nonetheless petitioned for this ruling to be struck down, claiming that there was a clear error in
application of the scale according to the Fee Standards of the Lawyers’ Association of Madrid. This nullification was
accepted by the High Court, with the fees ultimately being set at 47 thousands of euros (plus VAT), from which the
sum of 8 thousands of euros must be deducted. In other words, 40 thousands of euros (plus VAT). The entire sum
of the debt has now been lodged, and the VAT has been paid out of court, following presentation of the
corresponding invoice. The costs in the proceedings have not been valued.

The lawyer López Antón requested a record of various written submissions and rulings handed down in this appeal,
possibly in order to file these with the corresponding court bodies in order to establish any legal action which the
practice Despacho López Antón S.L.P. could bring against Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A., with these
declarations being issued by means of a Regulation Order dated 11 October 2011.

- Supreme Court: The fees were set by the Supreme Court at the sum of 44 thousands of euros (including VAT),
from which a sum 10,400 euros already previously paid by Empark would need to be deducted. The sum pending
payment (33 thousands of euros) has already been lodged by Empark. The invoicing lawyer petitioned for the
proceedings to be declared null and void. This position was not accepted by the Supreme Court, with a further
petition for clarification then being lodged. This was likewise rejected in a Ruling of 12 July 2011.

The practice Despacho López Antón Abogados SLP, as a result of the fees claimed for in the previous legal fee
claims proceedings, has also lodged a lawsuit under ordinary court proceedings, claiming for: (i) the part not settled of
the fees claimed for in the extraordinary procedural violation and cassation appeals (2901/2003), and which were not
recognised in the legal fee payment claim proceedings, amounting to 137 thousands of euros, plus the corresponding
VAT, and 15,499.84 euros of late-payment interest accruing, notwithstanding any which may subsequently accrue up
until payment of the debt; (ii) the late-payment interest accruing and not recognised by the Provincial High Court of
Madrid on the basis of the fees recognised in the legal fee claim proceedings, this sum amounting to 2 thousands of
euros. Notice of the lawsuit was served on Empark on 28 December 2011, the response being submitted on
26 January 2012. The Prior Hearing is scheduled for 4 June 2012, at 11:45 a.m.

The outcome of the proceedings will substantially depend on the ruling reached in the cost evaluation procedure by
the Supreme Court, in which costs have been challenged by their OHL. We would therefore classify this risk as
moderate.

2.– Ordinary Proceedings 1041/2009, lodged before the Court of First Instance 5 of Santander by the UTE POMBO
joint venture, comprising CONSTRUCTORA OBRAS PÚBLICAS SAN EMETERIO, S.A. AND EXCAVACIONES SAIZ,
S.A., against EMPARK APARCAMIENTOS Y SERVICIOS, S.A.

The purpose of the lawsuit is a claim for greater construction costs. The estimative judgement of the proceeding

12.– Ordinary Appeal 590/2011, lodged before the Public Authority Litigation Court 1 of Cuenca. Public authority
litigation appeal lodged by Dornier, S.A., against the decision to award the on-street public parking regulation contract

Guipuzcoanos, S.L. against Mr Rogelio Rodríguez Ordás regarding the rent for business premises 3 on the upper
floor of the Calle Sevilla car park in Madrid. The petition in these proceedings is termination of the lease agreement
dated 1 November 1969, subrogated by the respondent, and a claim for payment of 87,370.43 euros plus any rent
accruing up until the date when the premises are actually handed over.

The substantive terms of these proceedings are being examined by the Court of First Instance 16 of Madrid. The
Court initially began to process the case as verbal eviction proceedings based on non-payment, under the same case
number, despite the fact that the petition was lodged for ordinary court proceedings, given the existence of complex
matters which suggested that ordinary proceedings would be more advisable in order to offer the respondent greater
guarantees. The hearing was scheduled for 4 April at 2 p.m. On the date scheduled for the hearing, the Judge decided
that the proceedings should indeed be processed as ordinary proceedings, rather than a verbal hearing, specifically
because of the complexity of the issues raised. On 6 June 2011 a Regulatory Order was served for 26 May 2011,
indicating that the response to the lawsuit had been presented in due time and form, and scheduling the prior hearing
for 23 January 2012 at 12.30 p.m. When the date for the prior hearing arrived, the proceedings were suspended as
the other party had not been notified. The hearing was rescheduled for 13 March at 9.40 a.m.

Since the year 2007 the company Balsol 2001, S.A. has been affected by the works to construct the AVE high-speed

In September 2009 the company submitted a written calculation estimating the damages caused by temporary
occupation, amounting to 286 thousands of euros.

In June 2010 the public authorities responded to this written calculation, claiming that the fair price in the case would
be a sum of 32 thousands of euros.

In September/October 2010 the company projected this public authority valuation, and petitioned for payment to it of
the concurrent sum. The aforementioned sum of 32 thousands of euros was collected in September 2011.

The case has been before the Provincial Expropriation Board of Girona since December 2010, pending resolution.

The main legal disputes in progress in 2010 were:

Parties: Plaintiff: Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A. Respondent: City Council of Sant Cugat del Vallés. Amount:

-----

administrative appeal to the aforementioned ruling.

Status of the proceedings: The plaintiff has made conclusions and a subpoena of the plaintiff is pending for her to
present these written conclusions.

2.– Major Sum Proceedings brought by Huarte, S.A. against Ferrovial Aparcamientos, S.A. (now Empark
Aparcamientos y Servicios. S.A.) – Vista Desarrollo, S.A., Caixa Penedés, CARIPLO and Bolsa de Madrid requesting
that they cancel execution of the pledge of 850,614 shares in ESSA (now Cintra Aparcamientos S.A.).

A judgement upholding the arguments of Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A. and the other respondents has
been handed down, and this lawsuit must therefore be deemed to be concluded, following the Supreme Court
judgment of 10 December 2008. As costs were awarded against the plaintiff, Empark has filed three Cost Calculation
applications, one at each instance, claiming from Obrascón Huarte Laín, (OHL) the payment of fees corresponding to
Court Agents and Lawyers. The solicitor fees amount to approximately 80,000 euros and the Lawyer fees amount to
74 thousands of euros and 31 thousands of euros for the 1st and 2nd Instances respectively and 192 thousands of
euros for the Supreme Court.

On the other hand, Counsel Mr. Félix López Antón, who assumed the defence of Empark’s interests in different
instances of this proceeding, presented three proceedings for collecting legal fees against Empark claiming payment
of fees incurred for the 1st instance, the Provincial High Court and the Supreme Court. The fees corresponding to the
1st instance and the provincial High court were paid by Empark in October 2010.

The Supreme Court, by means of a court order dated 30 November 2010, and notified on 16 December 2010, has
issued judgement regarding the challenge for fees corresponding to this last instance in the legal Fees Claim report,
proceeding derived from the appeal for Civil Cassation no. 2903/2003, initiated by DESPACHO LÓPEZ ANTON SLP
(Law firm), before the First Chamber of the Supreme Court, claiming 192 thousands of euros as the principal. The
Chamber rejects the challenge for fees as undue and finds the challenge for said fees as excessive, setting the
amount to 44 thousands of euros. Subtracting the amount of 10 thousands of euros, which had been previously
deposited by Empark, the amount remaining to settle is 33 thousands of euros.

Said amount was paid on 28 December 2010.

3.– Ordinary Proceedings 1041/2009, lodged before the Court of First Instance 5 of Santander by the UTE POMBO
joint venture, comprising CONSTRUCTORA OBRAS PÚBLICAS SAN EMETERIO, S.A. AND EXCAVACIONES SAIZ,
S.A., against EMPARK APARCAMIENTOS Y SERVICIOS, S.A.

handed down on 17 May 2010, has sentenced us to pay 490 thousands of euros and is currently appealed before the
Provincial higher Court. However, said payment has been made by UTE POMBO and has been accounted for.

4.– Ordinary Proceeding 370/2010 filed before Contentious-Administrative court number 3 of Pontevedra, brought by
the Socialist Party, which challenges the contacting procedure relative to the construction for an underground parking
at Plaza España.

5.– Ordinary Court Proceedings 206/2005. Commercial Court 1, Malaga.

In this process, the agreement reached by the board of Directors of the Sociedad Municipal de Aparcamientos y
Servicios, S.A. of Malaga (SMASSA) was challenged, accepting a maximum fee of 3,900 thousands of euros for the
administrative concession of the underground for the construction of the C/Salitre parking for a period of 50 years.

The issue is currently at cassation before the Supreme Court (appeal no. 286/2007). By means of a court Order dated
14 October 2010, it is set for voting and the decision was issued on 19 January 2011 at 10:30 hours.

6.– Ordinary Court Proceedings 363/2006 and Ordinary Court Proceedings 84/2007. Commercial Court 1, Malaga.

Several agreements made by SMASSA are challenged, which entail the acceptance of a collaboration agreement
between SMASSA and the entity INEREXPO, which entails the assumption first of the electricity, cleaning and
security expenses as well as the annual payment of 50 thousands of euros for daily maintenance and operating costs
of the Interactive Music museum.

The suit ended at first instance with ruling No. 257/08, dated 5 October 2008, which partially finds for the plaintiff. An
appeal was filed against this Ruling on the part of the plaintiff by means of a letter dated 22 December 2008, to which
we opposed by means of a letter dated 14 October 2009, and as of yet, a decision has not been made.

7.– Ordinary Proceeding 46/2010, filed before the Contentious Administrative Court number 3 of Madrid, by Rogelio
Rodríguez Ordás against the City Council of Madrid and Estacionamientos Guipuzcoanos, S.L.

As for the Company’s financial risk management policy, this is based on the Group managing its capital in order to
guarantee that it will be in a position to continue operating as a profitable business, while maximising shareholder
return by striking an optimum balance between debt and equity.

Below are set out the main risks to which the Group is exposed:

- Liquidity risk: The Group establishes its treasury needs as part of its general policy through the use of two tools:
Treasury budget with a 12-month horizon, providing monthly detail and updates, and treasury budget with a 30-day
horizon, with daily updates and details. These tools identify treasury needs in volume and time, and make plans for
new financing needs.

- Credit risk: The Group maintains cash and equivalent liquid assets at financial institutions with a high-level credit
rating. It should furthermore be mentioned that there is no significant concentration of credit risk with third parties.

- Interest rate risk: Interest-rate risk affects the Group essentially through long-term outside resources. The Group
has contracted financial instruments that partially cover the risk of possible interest rate hikes.

- Exchange rate risk: The Group has no significant exchange rate risk, as most of its assets and liabilities, revenue
and expenses, are quoted in euros.

**Subsequent events**

There are no relevant events to point out except:

- On 23 January 2012 a sum of 31 thousands of euros in costs was collected from OHL.

- On 18 January 2012, the company Empark Aparcamientos Extremadura, S.L. was incorporated, with a capital

The Group has contracted financial instruments that partially cover the risk of possible interest rate hikes of long-term
outside resources.

**Environmental aspects**

Environmental activities are understood as covering any operation the main purpose of which is to prevent, reduce or
repair damage to the environment.

The investments derived from environmental activities are valued at the acquisition cost and are activated as greater
fixed asset expenses in the financial year in which they are incurred, following the criteria described in note 2
regarding applicable accounting standards.


-----

year in which they are incurred, irrespective of the point when the monetary or financial flow derived therefrom occurs.

The provisions relative to probable or certain responsibilities, legal proceedings in process and for compensation and
pending obligations of an undetermined amount, of an environmental nature not covered by contracted insurance
policies, are made when the liability or the obligation establishing the compensation becomes effective.

At 31 December 2011, the costs or expenses incurred with regard to environmental aspects are insignificant.

As for any such potential contingencies as may arise in the field of the environment, the directors do not believe that
they would have any significant impact on the enclosed annual accounts.

and the notes thereto for the year then ended. As indicated in Note 2.1 to the accompanying consolidated
financial statements, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the Group’s financial statements in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the European Union, and
other provisions in the regulatory framework applicable to the Group. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on the aforementioned consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, based upon work performed in
accordance with prevailing audit regulations in Spain, which require the examination, through the performance of
selective tests, of the evidence supporting the consolidated financial statements, and the evaluation of whether
their presentation, the accounting principles and criteria applied and the estimates made are in agreement with
the applicable regulatory framework for financial information. Our work did not include the audit of the 2010
annual account of certain subsidiaries, jointly controlled entities and associates, indicated in Note 1.1 to the
accompanying consolidated financial statements, whose assets and net results represent 20% and 47%,
respectively, related consolidated figures. These companies financial statements have been audited by other

EMPARK APARCAMIENTOS Y SERVICIOS, S.A. and its subsidiaries is based, with respect to the contribution
of these companies, mainly on the audit reports of the other auditors.

2. In our opinion, based on our audit and the audit report of other auditors, the accompanying 2010 consolidated
financial statements give a true and fair view, in all material respects, of the consolidated equity and
consolidated financial position of EMPARK APARCAMIENTOS Y SERVICIOS, S.A. and subsidiaries at

concession timeframes, the car parks shall be returned to the granting entity in perfect conditions of use, without any
payment for provision of service for the Group. The Subsidiaries carry out the same activity as the Parent Company.

If the purchasing of Empark Portugal – Empreendimentos e Exploraçao de Parqueamentos, S.A. had occurred on
01 January 2009, the net turnover and the result of the financial year attributed to the Group would have increased in
the sum of 21,127 thousands of euros and 1,218 thousands of euros respectively.

The accounting of this business combination had been provisionally carried out in the consolidated annual reports of
financial year 2009, since the valuation of acquired assets and liabilities undertaken had not been completed, nor had
the twelve month period set by IFRS-EU 3 yet elapsed: “Business combinations” used to complete said valuation.

This purchase has generated a good will of 115,169 thousands of euros, of which 85,356 thousands of euros
correspond to contract renovations and the acquiring of new contracts and 29,813 thousands of euros have been
assigned to assets of Empark Portugal – Empreendimentos e Exploraçao de Parqueamentos, S.A. and they are paid
off depending on the lifespan of those assets.

This goodwill assigned to assets has generated a deferred tax amounting to 30% of 29,813 thousands of euros, which
has resulted in a larger Goodwill for this amount.

Serranopark, S.A.

Company Serranopark, S.A. is not a part of the group’s consolidation scope as of 31 December 2009, since as of
10 July 2009, Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A. sold their 50% stake in said company to Cintra
Infraestructuras, S.A. (company belonging to the Ferrovial Group).

The value of the stake was 9,030 thousands of euros; it was sold for 521 thousands of euros, which generated a loss
of 8,509 thousands of euros. Said loss is reflected on line “impairment through disposal of intangible fixed assets” of
the consolidated income statement.

Others

During the year 2009, the following TJVs have been dissolved: Reinrod y Expo Zaragoza.

**_1.3 Correction of errors_**

– During the year 2010, the Company has received pending documentation relative to the purchasing of Empark
Portugal – Empreendimentos e Exploraçao de Parqueamentos, S.A., and as a consequence of this, certain operations
had been properly recorded, which were recorded in items pending allocation.

The proper recording of such operations is the following:

Invoices related with the purchasing of Empark Portugal – Empreendimentos e Exploraçao de Parqueamentos, S.A. in
the sum of 1,350 thousands of euros, which are recorded as the higher value of the stake.

Value added tax corresponding to part of said invoices for the amount of 450 thousands of euros.

Loans received in the sum of 1,800 thousands of euros.

The company has corrected the error retroactively in 2010, modifying the figures of financial year 2009 in the following
manner: the entry for the loan increased by 1,800 thousands of euros the items of other financial liabilities within the
long term debts and the entry for invoices increased the investment in companies of the group and subsidiaries in the
long term and reduces the items for other debts incurred with public Administrations since the VAT paid balances out
with the VAT deducted on the liabilities side.

This increase in the stakes by Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios S.A. over Empark Portugal – Empreendimentos e
Exploraçao de Parqueamentos, S.A., affects the goodwill and its placement on the assets side.

– During the year 2010, the final valuation of acquired assets and of the liabilities assumed by the business
combination that occurred on the 27[th] of July 2009 with the purchase of 100% of Empark Portugal- Empreendimentos
e Exploraçao de Parqueamentos, S.A. has been carried out.

Below is a summary of the elimination of the equity investment with the generation of Goodwill.

**_2.1 Basis of presentation_**

The financial information listed in these annual reports has been drafted using the International Financial Reporting
Standards adopted by the European Union (IFRS-EU) and becomes effective at the closing if the financial year.
Regarding the methods used to apply these regulations, it is worth mentioning that the Group has opted, in cases
where the IFRS-EU allows different alternative criteria, to value the fixed and intangible assets at historical cost,
capitalizing financial costs during the construction period and for the case of jointly controlled companies and joint
ventures with existing companies, consolidate them using the proportionate consolidation method. The Consolidated
Annual Reports have been prepared focussed on historic cost adjusted for the increase in value of the derivatives.
These criteria are the same ones applied in 2009.

The Group applied the IFRS-EU for the first time in financial year 2009 for drafting the consolidated financial
statements.

**_2.2 Accounting principles applied_**

_a) Standards and interpretations approved by the European Union, which are applicable to this financial year._

The accounting policies used for drafting the consolidated financial statements corresponding to the financial year
ended on 31 December 2010 are the same as the ones applied in the consolidated financial statements of the
financial year ended on 31 December 2009, except for the following standards and interpretations that are applicable
to the financial years beginning on 1 January 2010, to include:

- IFRS 2 “Share-based payments – group transactions with payments based on shares paid in cash”

The standard has been amended for the purpose of clarifying the accounting of share-based transactions that are
paid in cash by the group. This amendment replaces IFRIC 8 and IFRIC 11. The adoption of this amendment has
not made an impact on the financial position or in the Group’s results.

- IFRS 3 “Business combinations (Revised)” and IAS 27 “Consolidated and separate financial statements
(Amended)”

IFRS 3 (Revised) introduces significant changes in the accounting of business combinations. The changes affect
the valuation of the non dominant stakes, the accounting of transaction costs, the initial recognition and the
subsequent valuation of the contingent liabilities and the business combinations carried out in phases.

The amendments to IAS 27 specify under what circumstances an entity must present these consolidated financial
statements, how parent companies must account for the changes in the shares held of their subsidiaries and how
they must distribute the losses incurred by a subsidiary among the shares that grant control and shares that are not
dominant.

The adoption of these changes has not made an impact on the financial position or the Group’s results.

- IAS 39 “Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement – Items that can be designated as hedged items”

The amendment clarifies that an entity can designate a part of the changes in fair value or the changes in cash flow
of a financial instrument as a hedge item. This also covers the allocation of inflation, or a part of it, as a hedged risk
in special situations. The adoption of this amendment has not made an impact on the financial position or on the
Group’s results.

- IFRIC 12 “service Concession arrangements”

The interpretation clarifies how to apply the provisions listed in the IFRSs that have already been incorporated by
the commission to the Service concession arrangements. IFRIC 12 explains how to recognize the infrastructure of
the service concession arrangements in the concession company’s accounts. It also clarifies the difference
between the different phases of a service concession arrangement (construction/operation phases) and how the
income and expenses in each case must be identified in the accounts. It distinguishes two ways of identifying the
infrastructures and the income and expenses relative to them (the “models” for financial and intangible assets)
according to the risk of uncertainty relative to the concessionaire’s future income.

- IFRIC 15 “Agreements for real estate construction”

The interpretation clarifies when the revenue derived from construction or residential real estate must be identified
in the accounts and in particular, if the construction agreements are included in the scope of application of IAS 11
“Construction contracts” or IAS 18 “Revenue”, and offers guidance in this matter. The adoption of this interpretation
has not made an impact on the financial position or on the Group’s results.

- IFRIC 16 “Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation”


-----

of hedges of a net investment. It includes guides for identifying the foreign currency risks that qualify as a hedged
risk of a net investment; where, within a group, hedging instruments that are hedges of a net investment can be
held to qualify for hedge accounting and how an entity should determine the amount of currency exchange loss or
profit as related to the net investment as to the hedging instrument, which will be reclassified as earnings from the
sale of the net investment. The adoption of this interpretation has not made an impact on the financial position or on
the Group’s results.

- IFRIC 17 “Distributions of non-cash assets to owners”

The interpretation clarifies and provides guidance regarding the accounting of the distributions of non-cash assets
to owners of an entity, as distribution of reserves or as dividends. The adoption of this interpretation has not made
an impact on the financial position or on the Group’s results.

- IFRIC 18 “Transfer of assets from customers”

The interpretation clarifies and provides guidance regarding the accounting of the transfers of tangible assets from
customers or cash for purchasing or building a tangible asset. The adoption of this interpretation has not made an
impact on the financial position or on the Group’s results.

- IFRS improvements issued in May 2008

For the first time in May 2008, the IASB published amendments to the standards within the framework of annual
improvements for the purpose of eliminating inconsistencies and clarifying the standards. Al the amendments were
adopted on 31 December 2009, except the following:

    - IFRS 5 “Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations”: It clarifies when to classify as held for
sale, even when the entity maintains a non dominant stake after the sale. The adoption of the amendment is
applied prospectively and has not had an impact on the financial position or the Group’s results.

- IFRIC improvements issued in April 2009

For the second time in April 2009, the IASB published amendments to the standards within the framework of annual
improvements for the purpose of eliminating inconsistencies and clarifying the standards to include transitory
provisions

    - IFRS 8 “Operating segments”: Clarifies that the assets and liabilities of a segment must be listed only when
these assets and liabilities are included in the information received by the entity’s chief operating decision
maker.

    - IAS 7 “Statement of cash flows”: It clarifies that only the expenses accounting for an asset can be classified
as investment activity cash flow. The adoption of this modification has an effect on the statement of cash
flows of contingent payments corresponding to business carried out in 2010 and settled in cash.

    - IAS 36 “Impairment of assets”: The amendment clarifies the largest unit which can be applied to goodwill,
acquired in a business combination, is the operating segment as defined in IFRS 8, before aggregating it for
reporting purposes. The adoption of this amendment has not had an effect on the Group, since the annual
impairment test prior to aggregation.

Other amendments included in the IFRS Improvements of April 2009, which have not had an effect on accounting
policies, on the financial position or in the Group’s results are the following:

- IFRS 2 “Share-based payment”

- IFRS 5 “Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations”:

- IAS 1 “Presentation of financial statements”

- IAS 17 “Leases”

- IAS 38 “Intangible assets”

- IAS 39 “Financial instruments: Recognition and measurements”

- IFRIC 9 “Reassessment of embedded derivatives”

- IFRIC 16 “Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation”


-----

_year._

The Group has not adopted any published standard, interpretation or amendment prior to it coming into effect.

The Group is evaluating the effect that the following standards and interpretations published by the IASB and
approved by the European Union could have on the accounting policies, the financial statement or the Group’s results:

- IAS 32 “classification of rights issues” Applicable to financial years beginning after 1 February 2010;

- IAS 24 “Related party disclosures” Applicable to financial years beginning after 01 January 2011;

- IFRIC 19 “Extinguishing financial liabilities with equity instruments”: Applicable to financial years beginning after
01 July 2010;

- IFRIC 14 “Prepayments of a minimum funding requirement” Applicable to financial years beginning after 01 January
2011;

- Improvements to the IFRS (May 2010): Applicable to financial years after 1 January 2011 (except amendments to
IFRS 3 (2008) relative to the valuation of non-dominant stakes and share-based payment plans and the changes to
IAS 27 (2008) and amendment to IFRS 3 (2008) relative to contingent payments corresponding to business
combinations with a purchasing date prior to the date the revised standards came into effect, which are effective for
annual periods beginning after 1 July 2010);

_c) Standards and interpretations published by the IASB and still not approved by the European Union_

As of the date these consolidated financial statements were published, the following IFRS and modifications have
been published by the IASB but were not required to be followed and had not been approved by the EU:

- IFRS 9 “Financial instruments”: Applicable to financial years beginning after 01 January 2013;

- Amends IFRS 7 “Disclosures – “Transfer of financial assets” Applicable to financial years beginning after 01 July
2011;

- Amendment to IAS 12 “Deferred tax – Recovery of underlying assets”: applicable to financial years beginning after
01 January 2012.

The Group is currently assessing the impact of applying these standards and modifications.

Based on the analysis carried out to date, the Group believes that their application will not have a significant impact on
the consolidated financial statements during the initial application period.

**_2.4 Comparison of the information_**

As of 27 July 2009, Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A. purchased 100% of the Group EmparqueEmpreendimentos e Exploraçao de Parqueamentos, S.A. Consequently, while the global consolidated income
Statement in equity and the consolidated cash flow statement corresponding to the financial year ended on
31 December 2010 include the entire financial year, those corresponding to financial year 2009 include the activities
carried out by the Group Emparque-Empreendimentos e Exploraçao de Parqueamentos, S.A. since 27 July 2009.

This fact must be taken into account when comparing the figures corresponding to financial year 2010 included in
these Consolidated Annual reports with those corresponding to financial year 2009.

Below we show a balance with the variations produced by the correction of errors (see note 1.3) regarding the annual
reports of the year 2009, taking into account the adjustments made by applying IFRIC 12 (see note 2.7):

(*) Certain sums included in these balance sheets do not correspond with those included in the consolidated annual reports of the financial year that closed
on 31 December 2009, and reflect the adjustments carried out in accordance with CINIF 12 as indicated in note (2.7) and adjustments for the correction
of errors as indicated in note (1.3)

**_2.5 Negative working capital and operating company_**

The Group has a negative working capital as of 31 December 2010 of 21,471 thousands of euros (29,197 thousands
of euros in 2009). This circumstance, which could be indicative of uncertainty regarding the continuance of operations
of the Group is mitigated by the fact that these types of situations are common in these types of groups where a large
part of the sales are received in cash.

The Group operates under a centralized treasury system “cashpooling” by which Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios,
S.A., manages the needs of the treasury for the group.

Additionally, the group has lines of credit and other financial resources available for its treasury needs (note 21).

Therefore, the Board of Directors considers appropriate to prepare the annual reports based on the operating
company principle, which means the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities for the amounts and according to
how they are classified in the annual reports.


-----

**_2.6 Accounting estimates and judgements_**

The information contained in these Consolidated Annual reports is the responsibility of the Group’s Board of Directors.

In the Consolidated Annual Reports for the financial years ended in 2010 and 2009 have been carried out using
estimates by the Group’s Board of Directors to value some of the assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and
commitments listed in them. Basically, these estimates refer to:

- Evaluation of potential losses due to the impairment of certain assets.

- Useful life of material and intangible assets.

- Estimates related with the fair value of the assets purchased in business combinations and goodwill.

- Evaluation of possible contingencies due to legal and tax risks.

These estimates were carried using the best available information as of 31 December 2010 and 2009 regarding the
analyzed facts. However, it is possible that events that may occur in the future require modifying these estimates,
which would be carried out in accordance with IAS 8 if applicable.

**_2.7 Changes in Accounting Standards IFRIC 12_**

As indicated in note 2.2 (Applicable accounting standard), the current consolidated financial statements as of
31/12/2010 are the first considering the mandatory application of interpretation IFRIC 12 “Current Concession
Agreements” after it came into effect on 01/01/2010.

This interpretation regulates the accounting of public-private concession contract agreements for services provided by
the concessionaire, and in accordance with the agreements reached between the concessionaire and the awarding
authority, establishes the corresponding accounting methods that are to be followed.

IFRIC 12 affects public-private concession of services agreements when:

- The awarding authority controls or regulates what services the concessionaire must destine the infrastructure for, to
whom must the services be provided and at what price, and

- The awarding authority controls all significant residual stakes in the infrastructure at the end of the current
agreement.

Based on these agreements, the concessionaire acts as the provider of services, specifically infrastructure
construction or improvement services on one hand and on the other hand, operation and maintenance services during
the period of the agreement.

Depending on the contractual rights received by the concessionaire as payment for providing infrastructure
construction or improvement services, the accounting methods will be the following:

_Intangible method_

Most of the companies under Empark Group affected by the application of IFRIC 12 (the great majority of car park
concessionaires) have had the intangible model applied to them. On a general basis, it is understood that said model
is applicable when the Concessionaire receives the right to charge a price to users for using the public service.

This right is not unconditional and depends on if the users are using the service; therefore the demand risk is
assumed by the concessionaire.

On the other hand we have the public service regulation concessionaires of the on-street parking where the price for
users is set by the awarding authority but the demand risk is assumed by the concessionaire.

In this case, the valuation of the asset to be identified (value of the concession or value of the right to charge users for
public use) as a payment for infrastructure construction or improvement services will be carried out in accordance with
the provisions of IAS 38 “Intangible assets”, depreciating during the life of the concession. In this sense, the
application of IFRIC 12 has mainly caused assets that up to then were listed under the “Tangible assets” section,
which finally must revert to the awarding authority, to be listed in section “Other intangible assets-Administrative
Concessions” depreciating on a straight line basis over the life of the concession.

Likewise, within the applicability of IFRIC 12 framework, depending on the intangible model, future interventions,
which the Concessionaire must confront due to the use of the infrastructures for maintaining, re-establishing and
supplying them must be determined.


-----

The concessionaire identifies a financial asset within the scope of the unconditional contractual right to receive cash or
other financial asset of or under the management of whom is providing the construction services. In the Empark
Group, there is no case of a Concessionaire having this unconditional right.

The operator has the unconditional right to receive cash if the awarding authority contractually guarantees paying the
operator:

(a) specific or established amounts, or

(b) the deficit, if any, between the amounts received from public service users and the amounts specified or
established, even if payment is contingent on the operator, ensuring that the infrastructure meets the specified
quality or efficiency requirements.

The operator measures the financial asset at fair value.

Based on the above, and in accordance with the estimates and requirements set forth in IFRS 8, the information for
2009 has been re-expressed, whose formula did not include this interpretation in order to compare it with the
information from financial year 2010.

**_2.8 Resource management policies_**

The Group manages its investments after having carried out an in depth examination and control of potentially
attractive projects from the environmental, socio-labour, commercial, financial and economic perspectives, for the
purpose of achieving a sustainable and balanced growth.

In carrying out this task, the Group’s shareholders want to be in a balance position regarding expected investment
profits and the assumed level of risk.

**_2.9 Consolidation policies_**

During financial years 2010 and 2009, the individual annual accounting closing date for all companies included in the
scope of consolidation was the same. Likewise, for the purpose of uniformly presenting the different items that
comprise these consolidated annual accounts, uniform accounting criteria has been applied using the parent
company’s accounting criteria as a basis. The following methods have been applied to prepare the Consolidated
Annual Reports:

**a.** **Full consolidation method: All companies considered subsidiaries are fully consolidated. For these purposes,**
subsidiaries are those companies in which Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A. maintains effective control

assessing whether the Group controls another organisation, consideration is given to the existence and impact
of potential voting rights which can actually be exercised or converted. Inclusion in the scope of consolidation of
the Group is carried out from the first moment in which the control of the subsidiary becomes effective. The value
of the shares held by minority shareholders in equity and in the financial year results of fully consolidated
subsidiaries is listed in chapters “Minority interests” of the consolidated financial statements and “Results
attributed to minority interests” of the consolidated income statement. The losses attributed to minority interests
in a consolidated subsidiary, in the case that they exceed the amount of minority interests in the net equity, will
be assigned as a reduction of the items corresponding to the majority, except if the aforementioned minority
interests have a biding obligation to cover all or part of the losses, and provided they have the capacity to make
the additional required investment. Where the subsidiary subsequently records earnings, these will be assigned
to the majority until its share in the losses that were previously absorbed by the majority shareholders has been
recovered.

**b.** **Consolidation method by the participation method: Subsidiaries are accounted for by the participation**
method. For these purposes, subsidiaries are defined as all those companies in which the group has significant
influence over management but does not exercise control or joint management with third parties. Under the
participation method, the percentage of share in equity held by that company in reserves as well as yearly
results is identified.

**c.** **Proportionate consolidation method: Applies to joint ventures, which are those in which contractually, the**
management of subsidiaries is carried out jointly by the parent company and by third parties not related with the
group. The assets and liabilities assigned to joint ventures, which are jointly controlled with other parties are
listed in the Consolidated financial statement and classified in accordance with their specific nature in the
existing percentage share. In the same manner, the revenues and expenses arising from joint ventures are
recognized in the consolidated income statement in accordance with its own nature also mentioning the
percentage of share.

**d.** **Balances and transactions with Group companies: The balances and transactions with Group companies**
are eliminated in the consolidation process.

**e.** **Conversion of financial statements into currency other than the Euro: The financial statements of**
subsidiaries and joint ventures, whose records are denominated in a currency other than the Euro are translated
to euros by applying the year-end exchange rates to all its assets and liabilities except the balances of the
shares held in companies of the group and associated companies, which are converted using the rate at the time
they were included in the group. Within the consolidation process, the shares held in companies of the group are
eliminated against the shareholder equity, except in the associated companies, which are converted at the
exchange rate at closing.

The results are translated to euros at the average exchange rate for the year. Differences arising during the translation
process are recorded in the shareholder equity section as “currency translation differences”.

**The consolidation has been carried out on the basis of the following criteria:**

- The companies in which Cintra Aparcamientos y servicios, S.A. has more than a 50% stake in the registered capital
and/or whose management is effectively controlled by it, were fully consolidated.

- Companies in which Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A. is owner of 50% of the share capital, by the
proportionate consolidation method.

- The Temporary Joint Ventures are proportionally consolidated into the individual financial statements.

Companies in which Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A. has a stake of between 20% and 49%, are consolidated
using the equity method.


-----

The annual accounts of the foreign companies have been converted into euros on the basis of the year end exchange
rate for the assets and liabilities and the year’s average exchange rate for the profit and loss accounts. The
shareholders equity corresponding to the consolidated companies whose working currency is not the Euro has been
converted using historic exchange rates.

The equity of minority interests in the net equity and earnings for the year of the fully consolidated companies are
presented under the captions “Minority Interests” in the consolidated financial statements and “Income Attributed to
Minority Interests” in the consolidated income statement, respectively (note 20).

_a) Subsidiaries_

Dependent companies are those organisations, including special purpose vehicles, over which the Group exerts or
could exert control, directly or indirectly, this being understood as the power to direct the financial and operating
policies of a business in order to derive economic benefits from its activities.

In assessing whether the Group controls another organisation, consideration is given to the existence and impact of
potential voting rights which can actually be exercised or converted. Dependent companies are consolidated from the
date when control is transferred to the Group, and are excluded from the consolidation perimeter as soon as such
control ceases.

The acquisition cost method is used in accounting for the acquisition of dependent companies The cost of acquisition
is the fair value of the assets handed over, the asset instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed on the
date of exchange, the fair value of any additional consideration dependent on future events (provided that this is
probable and a reliable value can be placed upon it), in addition to those costs directly attributable to the acquisition.

The assets, liabilities, revenue and expenditure of dependent companies are incorporated in the consolidated annual
accounts on the basis of the full consolidation method:

1. The book values of stakes in the capital stock of dependent companies are compensated for, on the date of
acquisition, through the proportional part which the aforementioned values represent with regard to the fair value
of the assets acquired and liabilities undertaken.

2. The difference between the book value of the holding in the dependent company and the value attributable to
said holding out of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities undertaken is recognised, if positive, as
consolidation goodwill. Under the exceptional circumstance that the figure is negative, it is recognised as
revenue for the financial year in the consolidated income statement.

3. The assets and liabilities of group companies are included in the consolidated balance sheet, with the same
valuations as recorded in the respective balance sheet of the companies in question, financial statement except
for assets acquired and liabilities undertaken on the date of acquisition, which are included in the consolidated
balance sheet on the basis of their fair value on the date of acquisition, following consideration of any
amortisations and impairments occurring from that date onwards.

4. The revenue and expenditure of Subsidiaries are included in the Consolidated Annual Reports.

5. Debits and credits between companies included within the consolidation group are cancelled out, along with
revenue and expenditure involved in transactions between such companies, and results generated on the basis
of such transactions, if not performed with third parties.

If control is acquired in stages, the goodwill (or the negative consolidation difference) is established for each of the
individual transactions as the difference between the fair value of the holding and the net sum attributable to the
holding out of the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities undertaken which are in place on that date. The
identifiable assets and liabilities undertaken are included on the basis of the fair value in place at the time the control
was acquired, with the entry for outside shareholders necessarily recording the sum based on their stake in the net
equity.

The difference between the net sum attributable from the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired and in place
on the date of acquisition of control and the corresponding sum on each of the dates when the holdings were acquired
gives rise to an adjustment in the reserves of the Group, recorded net of the tax burden.

_b) Associated companies_

Associated companies are organisations over which any of the companies included within the consolidation group
exerts substantial influence. Substantial influence is deemed to exist if the Group has a stake in the company and can
intervene in its financial and operating policy decisions, without having actual control.


-----

When the equity method procedure is first applied, investments in associated companies are valued at the sum
corresponding to the percentage represented by the holding at the time of the investment, based on the fair value of
the assets acquired and liabilities undertaken. If the resulting difference between the cost of the stake and this value is
positive, this is included in the book value of the investment. If it is negative, the difference is recorded directly in the
global consolidated income statement.

Any variations experienced during the financial year in progress in the net equity of the Group included in the
consolidated annual accounts under the equity method, following elimination of the proportion based on results
generated in transactions between that company and the company holding the stake, or any other group company,
and not involving third parties, increase or reduce, as applicable, the book value of the holding in question to the
corresponding proportion, following consideration of any amortisations and impairments occurring since the method
was applied for the first time.

Profits distributed by the Group included in the consolidated annual accounts under the equity method reduce the
book value of the holding.

A homogenisation of values and over time is applied to associated investments in the same way as for dependent
companies.

The information referring to the investment in the Associated companies which are consolidated under the equity
method are the following:

The associated companies which make up the Group have had of the equity method applied in their consolidation.

_c) TJVs (Temporary Joint Ventures) and Companies as Joint Businesses_

The balance sheets and the profit and loss accounts of these companies have been consolidated proportionally in the
consolidated financial statement and in the consolidated income statement as of 31 December 2010.

The group recognises the proportional part corresponding to it of assets controlled jointly and liabilities incurred jointly
in accordance with the percentage stake, along with assets attached to joint operations which are under control and
liabilities incurred as a result of joint business.

Likewise, the consolidated income statement recognises the corresponding part of revenue generated and costs
incurred through the joint business. Additionally, the costs incurred with regard to the stake in the joint business are
also recorded.

Non-realised results deriving from reciprocal transactions are eliminated in proportion to the stake, in addition to the
sums of reciprocal assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and cash flows.

- During the year 2010 the following TJVs have been dissolved: T-4 Barajas and Lanzarote.

_d) Operations and assets controlled jointly_

Non-realised results deriving from reciprocal transactions are eliminated in proportion to the stake, in addition to the
sums of reciprocal assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and cash flows.

**_2.10 Main valuation standards applied by the consolidated financial statement and the consolidated income_**
**_statement._**

_2.10.1 Intangible assets_

The items included in the “Intangible assets” section of the attached consolidated financial statement are identified
initially by their purchasing price or production cost, including capitalised financial expenses and subsequently, they
will be measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and loss due to any deterioration. At present the Group
records no intangible assets with undefined in the Group. The majority of assets listed in this section are
administrative concessions for car parks and are paid off following the straight line method during the concession
period.


-----

a. Concessions

This chapter includes the licence fees satisfied in determined concessions for operating car parks.

It likewise includes the fees paid on certain administration contracts for the operation of the vehicle parking service on
city streets subject to hourly control using ticket-issuing machines. In this case the concessions correspond to
administrative contracts for the operation of public services, under the concession system, as governed by the terms
of Royal Legislative Decree 2/2000, approving the Revised Text of the Public Authorities Procurement Act and Public
Sector Procurement Act (Law 30/2007, of 30 October 2007).

After applying IFRS 12, it also includes the cost of constructing the car park, whose concession has been awarded by
a public entity and in which the demand risk is assumed by the concessionaire, (note 2.7).

These administrative concessions are listed in the assets at their cost, less the cumulative amortisation and the
cumulative sum of acknowledged valuation corrections for impairment.

The concessions are amortised on a linear basis over the period of the concession.

b. Computer applications

Licences acquired for computer programs from third parties are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred in
acquiring them and preparing the specific program for use. The Group depreciates its computer software on a straightline basis, distributing the cost of the assets between the estimated useful lives of the same, which is three years.

The costs connected with the development or maintenance of computer programs are recognised as an expense
when they are incurred. The costs directly connected with the production of individual, identifiable computer programs
produced by the Group, provided that it is considered probable that they will generate economic benefits greater than
the costs for more than one year, are recognised as intangible fixed assets. Direct costs include the cost of the staff
developing the computer programs and an appropriate percentage of general costs.

_2.10.2 Tangible fixed assets_

Tangible fixed asset elements are recognised at their cost of acquisition, with the addition of the costs incurred up until
their operational start-up, less the cumulative amortisation and the cumulative sum of recognised losses.

The costs of the extension, modernisation or improvement of tangible fixed assets are incorporated within the asset as
an increase in its value only if they represent an increase in its capacity, productivity or an extension to its useful life,
and wherever it is possible to calculate or estimate the book value of the elements cancelled from the inventory having
been replaced.

The removal or disposal of any items is reflected in the accounts by eliminating the cost there of and the
corresponding cumulative amortisation.

The costs of major repairs are recorded as assets and amortised over the course of their estimated useful life, while
recurrent maintenance expenses are debited to the income statements during the financial year in which they occur.

The depreciation of tangible fixed assets, except for land, which is not amortised, is calculated in accordance with the
values of the updated cost, following the linear method based on the estimated useful life, in accordance with the
depreciation actually suffered through operation, usage and enjoyment. The estimated useful lifespan are:

**Estimated useful life**

Buildings and other construction............................................................................................................................. 50
Machinery, installations and tools ........................................................................................................................... 10
Furniture and fixtures .............................................................................................................................................. 10
Transport elements ................................................................................................................................................. 6
Other fixed assets ................................................................................................................................................... 3

The car parks which are part of the tangible assets (in the caption “Buildings”) are valued at the acquisition price or at
the production cost, depreciated on a straight-line basis over the life of the concession.

Where the book value of an asset is greater than its estimated recoverable value, its value is reduced immediately
down to the recoverable sum.

The income and expenses from selling tangible assets are calculated by comparing the amount obtained by the sale
with the accounting value and are recorded in the income statement in the “Impairment and result through disposal of
fixed assets” section.


-----

each balance sheet.

At least at the close of the financial year, the necessary evaluation corrections based on any impairment in value are
applied.

_2.10.3 Impairment losses_

In the case of goodwill, the group carries out annual value impairment tests. In the case of depreciable assets, at each
account close the Group assesses the existence of any loss in value that forces it to reduce the carrying amount. If
any loss indication is present, the recoverable value of the asset is calculated in order to identify the scope of the loss
by impairment in case its recoverable value is lower than its book value, and its effect is recorded in the income
statement. Impairment losses must be assessed for each individual asset. If this is not possible, the impairment loss is
determined for the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash flows independent of flows from other
assets (cash-generating units).

The recoverable amount is the higher of the market value (arms length value less associated costs) and the value in
use. The usage value is calculated from estimated future cash flows, discounted at a rate that reflects the present
market value, taking into account the value of money and specific risks associated with the asset.

Where an impairment loss is subsequently reversed, the carrying amount of the asset is increased subject to the
maximum limit of the original amount at which the asset was carried before the impairment was recognised. The
impairment loss of goodwill is not reversible.

_2.10.4 Interest costs_

Financial costs directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of fixed asset elements requiring a period of time
greater than one year in order to be fit for use are included in the cost until such time as the asset is in operational
condition.

_2.10.5 Financial assets_

a) Loans and items receivable

Loans and items receivable are non-derivative financial assets with sums receivable which are fixed or can be
established and are not listed on an active market. These are included under current assets, except those with a
maturity date beyond twelve months from the date of the consolidated financial statement, which are classified as noncurrent assets. Loans and items receivable are included under “Corporate loans” and “Trade debtors and other
accounts receivable on the balance sheet.

These are financial assets are initially valued at their fair value, and subsequently in accordance with their amortised
cost based on the effective rate of interest. Transaction costs directly attributable to their acquisition are recognised in
the consolidated income statement. On a quarterly basis, the necessary valuation corrections based on impairment in
value are applied, if there is any evidence that the entire sums owed will not be collected. The sum of the value
impairment loss is the difference between the book value of the asset and the value of the estimated future cash
flows, discounted at the effective rate of interest at the time of initial recognition. Any applicable valuation corrections
through impairment and reversion are recorded in the consolidated income statement.

The recognition and reversion of valuation corrections through the impairment of client accounts receivable have been
included under “Losses, impairment and variation in provisions through trade operations” in the consolidated income
statement.

The sums charged to the impairment account are normally cancelled once there is no expectation of more cash being
recovered.

The maximum credit risk as of the date the information was presented is the fair value of each one of the
aforementioned accounts receivable categories. The group maintains no guarantee as insurance.


-----

b) Investments in the assets of group, multi-group and associated companies:

They are valued at their cost less, where applicable, the cumulative value of value impairment corrections. However,
where there is an investment made prior to the classification of a company as a Group, Multi-group or Associated
Company, the cost of the investment is assumed to be its book value prior to such classification. Prior valuation
adjustments entered into the accounts directly under the net equity are maintained there until cancellation.

Investments in the assets of group and associated companies are included in the accounting records, under both
current assets and non-current.

The current assets include short-term investment in group and associated companies, comprising corporate loans and
other financial assets.

The non-current assets record the balance of long-term investments on group and associated companies, comprising
asset instruments. Asset instruments are broken down in the balances of holdings in group companies, holdings in
associated companies and share disbursements pending and not called on.

If there exists objective evidence that the book value is unrecoverable, the relevant valuation correction is applied as
the difference between the book value and the recoverable sum, the latter understood as whichever is the greater of
the fair value less the costs of sale and the current value of the future cash flows derived from the investment.

_2.10.6 Financial derivatives at fair value_

Derivatives are initially identified by their fair market value as of the contract date. The subsequent changes in market
value are recorded as well on each balance closing date. The method of identifying the profit and losses will depend
on if the instrument is designed as hedging or not and if it is, on the type of hedging. The different types of hedging
designated by the Group are the following:

i. Cash flow hedge: Its purpose is to hedge the exposure to highly probable future transactions and variations in
cash flow. The gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recorded by the non efficient section f the Consolidated
Income Statement, while the efficient part is identified directly on the Equity of the Consolidated Financial
statement. The amount deferred in equity is not recognised in the consolidated income statement until the
transactions hedged are taken to the income settlement or until the maturity date of the transactions. This
recognition is carried out the same way as the results of the hedge item.

Lastly, in the case that the hedge is interrupted, the amount recognized in equity to date is attributed to the result
proportionate to the remaining underlying life.

ii. Fair value hedge: Its purpose is to cover the exposure to changes in the value of an asset or a recognized
liability or firm commitments regarding transactions to be carried out. The gain or loss on the hedging instrument
along with the loss or gain produced in the hedge asset or liability is recorded in the consolidated income
statement.

iii. Hedge of net foreign investments: Its purpose is to cover the exposure to changes in the value of said
investments attributed to oscillations in the exchange rate. The gain or loss is recorded by the non efficient
section f the Consolidated Income Statement, while the efficient part is identified directly on the Equity of the
Consolidated Financial statement. The amount deferred in equity is recognised in the income statement at the
sale or maturity of said investment.

In the case of derivatives that do not qualify as hedge items, the loss or gain of said instrument are recorded in the
consolidated income statement.

The method applied for calculating the fair value of the financial derivatives is explained in note 21 of this report.

_2.10.7 Business Combinations and Goodwill_

The business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition cost method, which entails recognizing the fair
value of the assets and liabilities identified in the acquired business. Goodwill is the positive difference between the
cost of an investment and the value of the aforementioned assets and liabilities. In the acquisitions of subsidiaries, the
goodwill that is generated is considered as greater value of the share. The consolidated goodwill does not depreciate
and is subject to the “impairment test” (note 6). In subsequent acquisition of companies over which a previous control
is had, the difference between the over-prices paid in the currency of the acquired company’s country of origin and the
net value of the share acquired in the company is recorded as goodwill.

As far as operations with minority interests, the Group handles these as operations with third parties. The gains or
losses that result from sale operations with minority interests are recorded in the income statement, while the
acquisitions generate goodwill due to the difference between the price paid and the value of the acquired net assets.


-----

group, the decrease in share participation is valued at fair market value and is recorded in the consolidated income
statement.

Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units with the aim of testing losses through impairment. This allocation is
made to those cash generating units expected to benefit from the merger of businesses during which the goodwill
arose.

_2.10.8 Stock_

Stock is valued at its cost or its net realisable value, whichever is lower. The cost of stock is established by application
of the weighted average cost principle.

The cost of the finished products and products in progress correspond to construction in progress and completed, and
include the costs incurred in construction of car parking destined to concession of usage.

Parking spaces intended for sale and included in stock valued at the price of acquisition or the cost of production.

If the cost is greater than the market value, the relevant valuation corrections are applied and are recognised as an
expense in the profit and loss account. If the circumstances leading to the value correction cease to exist, the sum of
the correction is subject to reversion and is recognised as revenue in the consolidated income statement.

_2.10.9 Cash and other equivalent liquid assets_

Cash and other equivalent liquid assets include cash on hand, demand deposits at banks, and short term, high liquid
investments which initially have a maturity of three months or less and are not subject to a significant risk of changes
in value.

This section includes the short term restricted cash flow. This concept collects the investments of the same nature and
maturity affected by financing of specific infrastructure projects, whose availability is restricted by financing contracts
as guarantee to cover specific short term obligations relative to interests or principle of the debt as well as for the
future maintenance of the infrastructure.

_2.10.10 Equity_

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are
presented in equity as a deduction, net of taxes. The purchasing of Parent Company shares by consideration paid,
including attributed associated costs are deducted from the equity. When these shares are sold or subsequently
reissued, any amount received net of costs includes the equity.

The basic profit by action is calculated as the quotient between the net profits attributed to the parent company and
the average weighted number of ordinary shares in circulation during said period. In turn, the diluted profit by action is
calculated as the quotient between the net incomes attributed to the ordinary shareholders and the average weighted
number of ordinary shares in circulation during said period.

In the case that the Group’s consolidated Annual Accounts correspond with the financial years ended on
31 December 2009 and 2010; the basic profits by action coincide with the diluted.

_2.10.11 Provisions for employees_

a) Pension commitments:

Fixed provision pension plans

Pension plans which are not classified as fixed contribution plans are considered fixed provision arrangements. In
general, fixed provision plans establish the sum of the provision to be received by the employee at the time of
retirement, normally in accordance with one or more factors, such as age, years of service and remuneration.

The Group recognises in its balance sheet a provision for fixed provision pension plans based on the difference
between the current value of the committed remunerations and the fair value of any possible assets subject to
commitments which are to be used to settle the obligations, with any appropriate deduction being made in accordance
with the sum of the costs of past services not yet recognised.

If the above difference gives rise to an asset, the value placed on this may not be greater than the current value of the
provisions which may be returned to the Group in the form of direct reimbursements or reduced future contributions
plus, where applicable, the part pending allocation to results through costs for past services. Any adjustment which the
Group may be required to make on the basis of this limit in the valuation of the assets is attributed directly to the net
equity, being recognised as reserves.


-----

hypotheses which are unbiased and mutually compatible.

Any variation in calculation of the current value of the committed remunerations or, as applicable, the corresponding
assets, at the date of close, as a result of actuarial profits and losses, is recognised in the financial year during which it
arises, recorded directly in the net equity as reserves. For these purposes, profits and losses cover only variations
arising through changes in actuarial hypotheses or adjustments based on experience.

Costs of past services are recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement, except in the case of
revocable rights, in which case they are attributed to the consolidated income statement on a linear basis over the
remaining period up until the rights based on past services become irrevocable. However, if an asset is derived, the
revocable rights are attributed to the income statement immediately, unless a reduction occurs in the current value of
the provisions which may be returned to the Group in the form of direct reimbursement or reduced future contributions,
in which case the excess above this reduction is attributed immediately to the consolidated income statement.

At 31 December 2010 and 2009 there are 76, 25 and 3 persons with whom companies Empark Aparcamientos y
Servicios S.A, Dornier S.A.U and Balsol 2001 S.A. respectively maintain retirement plan commitment. These
commitments are not significant.

b) Redundancy compensation:

Redundancy compensation is paid to employees as a result of a decision by the Group to terminate their employment
contracts prior to the normal retirement age, or if the employee agrees to retire voluntarily in exchange for such
provisions. The Group recognises these provisions when a proven commitment has been agreed for the termination of
the employment of workers, in accordance with a detailed, formal plan, with no possible withdrawal, or an agreement
has been reached to provide redundancy compensation as a result of an offer made in order to encourage voluntary
redundancies. Those provisions which are not to be paid within 12 months of the date of the balance sheet are
discounted at their current value.

_2.10.12 Transactions among tied parties_

In general, operations among tied parties are accounted for at the initial point at their fair value. In any case, if the
agreed price differs from the fair value, the difference is recorded in accordance with the economic reality of the
operation. The subsequent valuation is made in accordance with the terms set out in the corresponding regulations.

_2.10.13 Subsidies_

A subsidy is considered not refundable when there is an individual concession agreement for the subsidy, all the
conditions for its concession have been met and there are no reasonable doubts that payment will be collected.

The monetary type subsidies are valued using the fair value of the awarded amount.

_2.10.14 Provisions and contingent liabilities_

Provisions for contingencies and expenses are accounted for in accordance with the estimated amount required to
deal with probable or certain responsibilities, legal proceedings in progress and for compensation and pending
obligations of an undetermined amount, guarantees or other similar sureties.

Provisions are recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present obligation, either legal or implicit, as a
result of past events, where it is deemed probable that this will involve the need for outgoing resources for settlement,
and the sum can be estimated in a reliable manner.

Provisions are valued at the current value of the disbursements which are expected to be required in order to settle
the obligation, using a pre-tax rate which reflects the opinions of the current market as to the temporary value of
money and the specific risks of the obligation. Adjustments in the provision based on any updates are recognised as a
financial expense as they gradually accrue.

Provisions maturing within one year or less and with an insignificant financial impact are not discounted.

Contingent liabilities are possible obligations arising as a result of past events, the materialisation of which depends
on whether or not one or more future events should occur, outside the control of the Group.

Given the activities in which the Group is currently engaged, it has no liabilities, expenses, assets or provisions and
contingencies of an environmental nature which could prove significant with reference to its net equity, its financial
situation and its results. Hence, specific breakdowns are not included in the report herein on the consolidated annual
accounts with regards information on environmental issues.


-----

the financial year in which they are incurred, irrespective of the point when the monetary or financial flow derived there
from occurs.

When such expenses involve the acquisition of tangible assets the purpose of which is to minimise environmental
impact and to protect and improve the environment, these are included in the accounts as an increase in the value of
fixed assets.

_2.10.15 Financial liabilities_

Debts and items payable

These liabilities are initially carried at the fair net value of the expenses incurred in the transaction, subsequently
recording these by their depreciated cost according to the effective interest method. The effective interest rate is the
discount rate equal to the expected flow of future payments foreseeable up until maturity of the liability. In the case
that the effective interest rate is initially considered different from the market interest, the liability is valued taking into
account the actual value of the future flows at that market rate in the case of loans with set interest rates. If said
interest rate is not fulfilled, the valuation of these is also carried out at the aforementioned market interest rate.

In the event of a renegotiation of existing debts, it is considered that no substantial modification has occurred to the
financial liability if the lender of the new loan is the same as that which granted the initial loan and the current value of
the cash flows, including the associated issuance and execution costs using the effective interest method, varies by
no more than 10% from the current value of the cash flows pending payment on the original liability, calculated in
accordance with this same method.

_2.10.16 Income tax and deferred taxes_

After 1 January 2005 the Group began paying tax under the consolidated tax system with Cintra Concessions de
Infraestructuras de Transporte S.A., as a result of the change in ownership which occurred in 2004, following which
the Parent Company fell within the aforementioned tax Consolidation perimeter. The Group previously paid taxes
under the consolidated taxation system as part of the Ferrovial, S.A. Group. During 2009 and as a consequence of the
purchase-sale operation mentioned in note 1.2, the Group left the aforementioned tax status and the Company as of
31 December 2009, requested taxation as a fiscal group effective 1 January 2010. It is comprised of the following
companies:

- Empark, Aparcamientos y Servicios S.A.

- Dornier, S.A.U.

- Femet, S.A.

- Guadianapark, S.A.

- Balsol 2001, S.A.

- Estacionamientos Guipuzcoanos, S.L.U.

The cost (revenue) derived from profits tax is the sum accrued under this item during the financial year, covering both
the cost (revenue) of current tax and deferred tax.

Both the cost (revenue) derived from current and deferred taxes are recorded in the consolidated income statement.
However, the tax impact connected with items directly recorded in the consolidated statement of net equity is
recognised within the net equity.

Assets or liabilities based on current tax are valued for the sums expected to be paid to or recovered from the tax
authorities, employing the regulations in force or approved and pending publication at the date of close of the financial
year.


-----

Deferred taxes are calculated in accordance with the liability method, based on the temporary differences arising
between the taxable base sums of the assets and liabilities and their book values. However, where deferred taxes are
the result of the initial recognition of an asset or a liability in a transaction other than a combination of businesses
which, at the time of the transaction, does not affect either the book result or the calculation base for the tax, they are
not recognised. Deferred tax is established by applying the regulations and taxation rates approved or about to be
approved at the date of the balance sheet, and which are expected to be applied when the corresponding deferred tax
asset is realised or the deferred tax liability settled.

Assets through deferred taxes are recognised to the extent that it is considered probable that future taxable profits will
be made which could be used to compensate for temporary differences.

Deferred taxes are recognised in accordance with the temporary differences arising in investments in subsidiaries and
associated companies and joint businesses, except in those cases where the Company can control the time of
reversion of the temporary differences, and it is likewise probable that these will not revert in the foreseeable future.

The term consolidated corporate taxes includes all taxes, national and foreign, related to profits subject to tax. The
consolidated corporate tax also includes other taxes such as taxes that encumber the repatriation of results as well as
any other tax that uses the accounted income as a basis for calculations.

The corporation tax expense reflected in the consolidated financial statements is calculated by aggregating the
expense registered for each company that belongs to the consolidated group, increased or decreased, as appropriate,
by elimination of accounting consolidation adjustments and by the differences arising between the taxable base sums
of the assets and liabilities and their book values.

Deferred taxes are not recognized when the transaction has no effect on the accounting and/or fiscal value of the
involved assets or liabilities. In the case of business combinations, the corresponding deferred taxes derived from the
price assigning process and the fiscal amortisation of the generated goodwill in each case.

The assets and liabilities by deferred taxes are calculated at current taxation rates as of the date of the consolidated
income statement and which are foreseen to be applicable during the period in which the asset is realised or the
liability is settled. They are debited or credited to the income statement except when they refer to items that are
directly recorded as net equity, in which case, they are accounted for as debit or credit to said accounts. By non
distributed profit of the subsidiaries, there is no liability by deferred taxes when the Group can control the reversion of
the temporary differences and it is not probable that these will be reverted in a foreseeable future. The assets by
deferred taxes and the tax credits derived from negative tax base sums are identified when it is probable that the
Group may recover these in the future regardless of the time in which they are recovered and always when the
recovery is prior to the legal period for usage. The assets and liabilities by deferred taxes are not deducted and are
classified as a non-current asset (liability) in the balance sheet. At each year-end, the recognised deferred tax assets
are reviewed.

_2.10.17 Conversion foreign currency transactions_

The Group’s foreign currency conversions into a currency different than the functional currency is carried out by
applying the current exchange rate at closing for balance and average exchange rate operations at the date of the
loss and profit transaction.

The annual accounts of companies in foreign currency have been converted to euros using the closing exchange rate
method in accordance with the following rates:

**2010** **2010** **2009** **2009**

**Exchange Rate** **Average** **Closing** **Average** **Closing**

**Euro/pound ................................................................................................** 0.8561 0.8574 0.8889 0.8876

**Euro/Turkish lira................................................................................................2.0491** 2.0560 2.0361 2.0437

_2.10.18 Recognition of revenue_

Revenue and expenses are attributed in accordance with the accrual principle, in other words based on when the true
value of the goods and services they represent becomes current, irrespective of when the monetary or financial value
arising from them is realised.

Revenue is recorded at the fair value of the consideration to be received and represents the sums receivable for
goods delivered and services provided within the ordinary course of the Group’s activities, less returns, rebates,
discounts and VAT.

The Group recognises revenue when the sum thereof can reliably be valued, it is probable that future economic
benefits will be received by the Group and specific conditions are met for each of the activities, as detailed below. The


-----

been resolved. The Group bases its estimate on historical results, taking into consideration the type of client, the type
of transaction and the specific terms of each agreement.

a) The car park business may be divided into:

a.1) Off-street and mixed parking

a.2) On-street parking (ORA)

a.3) Car parks for local residents

a.1) Off-street and mixed parking

Off-street car park revenues are recorded when the hourly parking rate is paid and, in the case of season ticketholders, on an accrual basis. Mixed car parks (with public and private spaces) record revenues as follows: in the case
of public spaces, in the manner described in the preceding paragraph; and in case of private spaces, the amount
received is recorded in the income statement at the time of the transfer of concession usage of the corresponding
parking spaces.

Fixed assets (car parks) are amortised on the basis of their useful life.

Regarding the public spaces, these are recorded in inventories and are transcribed to the income statement on the
date of the transfer of the concession of usage.

a.2) On-street parking (ORA)

Revenue from the ORA parking meter service is mainly based on the sum corresponding to the cost of providing the
service plus a percentage, generally between 1% and 20%, of the surplus between that cost and the funds collected.
On some ORA contracts, the revenue is earned at a fixed rate (service cost), entirely irrespective of the funds
collected, which are in all cases paid over to the City Council. This is recorded in the accounts at the time when the
service is provided.

a.3) Car parks for local residents

This business involves the construction of car parks whose spaces are sold directly to the end customer during the
timeframe of the concession. The sales and costs are not recorded until the parking space is delivered, which tends to
coincide with the signature of the contract, or exceptionally, the public deed of sale.

_2.10.19 Leases_

a) If any Group company is the lessee – Financial lease

The Group leases certain tangible fixed assets. Leases of tangible fixed assets where the Group substantially retains
the risks and benefits derived from ownership are classified as financial leases. Financial leases are capitalised at the
commencement of the lease at the fair value of the property leased, or the current value of the minimum payments
agreed under the lease, which ever is lower. The calculation of current value is based on the implicit interest rate of
the contract, and if this cannot be established, the Group interest rate for similar operations.

Each lease payment is distributed between the liability and financial charges. The total financial charge is distributed
over the course of the lease and attributed to the consolidated statement of the financial year when it accrues,
applying the effective interest rate method. Contingent payments are recorded as a cost for the financial year when
incurred. The corresponding lease obligations, net of financial charges, are included in “Creditors through financial
leases”. Fixed assets acquired under a financial lease system depreciate during their useful life or the duration of the
contract, whichever is less.

b) If any Group company is the lessee – Operating lease

Leases where the lesser retains a substantial part of the risks and benefits derived from ownership are classified as
operational leases. Payments under operational leases (net of any incentive received from the lesser) are charged to
the consolidated statement of the financial year when they accrue, on a linear basis over the period of the lease.


-----

c) When the group is the lesser

Where assets are the leased under a financial lease arrangement, the current value of lease payments, discounted at
the implicit interest rate of the contract, is recognised as an item receivable. The difference between the gross sum to
be received and the current value of this sum, corresponding to interest not accrued, is attributed to the consolidated
statement of the financial year when that interest accrues, in accordance with the effective interest rate method.

Where assets are leased under an operational lease arrangement, the asset is included in the consolidated statement
of the financial statement sheet in accordance with its nature. Revenue derived from the lease is recognised in a linear
manner over the course of the lease period.

**3 Management of financial and currency risks**

The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including exchange rate risk, interest rate
risk and price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.

Risk management is carried out by the Economic and Financial General Management Department of Empark
Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A., which identifies, evaluates and arranges coverage for financial risks in accordance
with the policies approved by the Board of Directors. The Administrative Board provides policies for overall risk
management, and also for specific areas, such as exchange rate risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, and use of
derivative and non-derivative instruments and the investment of surplus liquidity.

The financial risks to which the Company is exposed include those derived from the guarantees and bonds required in
order for the company to undertake its activities.

During the 2009 and 2010 financial years, the Company had in place bank guarantees with third parties and
guarantee commitments with other Group companies in order to engage in its business.

**_Market Risk: Exchange rate risk_**

Management has established an exchange rate risk management policy for foreign currencies other than the
operating currency. In order to manage the exchange rate risks derived from future commercial transactions and
recognised assets and liabilities, futures contracts negotiated by the Treasury Department are employed. Exchange
rate risk arises where future commercial transactions or recognised assets or liabilities are quoted in a currency other
than the organisation’s operating currency.

**_Market Risk: Exchange rate risk from cash flows and fair value_**

At 31 December 2010, if the interest rates on outside resources quoted in euros had been 50 basis points
higher/lower, with all other variables remaining constant, the result after taxes for the period would have been (49)/49
thousands of euros lower/higher, mainly as a result of an increase/decrease in the cost of interest on variable-rate
loans.

The Group carries out the corresponding interest rate hedges by contacting an IRS (Interest Rate Swap). (See note
21).

**_Credit risk_**

Credit risk is managed by groups. Credit risk arising from cash and cash equivalents and deposits held in banks and
financial institutions, along with wholesale and retail clients, including pending accounts receivable and committed
transactions. Regarding banks and financial institutions, only financial institutions that are known to be reputable and
solvent will be accepted.

**_Liquidity risk_**

Prudent management of liquidity risk involves holding sufficient cash and tradable securities, having access to finance
through a sufficient sum of agreed credit facilities and having the capacity to unwind market positions. Given the
dynamic type data from subjacent businesses, the object of the Group’s treasury Department is to maintain the
flexibility in financing by the availability of lines.

**146,427** **146,474**

In the year 2000, several companies were merged, resulting in a goodwill amount of 40,480 thousands of euros, which
was compensated on the one hand by a reduction in the issue premium for an amount of 35,639 thousands of euros
and, on the other hand, with a reduction in the reserves for an amount of 4,841 thousands of euros. In the year 2004,
as a result of the stock market flotation of Cintra Concesiones de infraestructuras de Transporte, S.A. this goodwill
increased and the depreciation corresponding to the months between August 2000 and December 2003 (41 months)
had to be applied in the sum of 6,915 thousands of euros.

In 2009, Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A purchased Empark Portugal – Empreendimentos e Exploraçao de
Parqueamentos, S.A., this purchase generated goodwill of 116,520 thousands of euros of which 81,809 thousands of
euros were financial goodwill since 33,992 thousands of euros were assigned to assets of Empark Portugal –
Empreendimentos e Exploraçao de Parqueamentos, S.A. and 719 thousands of euros to company assets through the
participation method and are paid off according to the useful life of the assets. The amortisation for 2009 was 870
thousands of euros and 1,775 thousands of euros in 2010. Additionally, Empark Portugal – Empreendimentos e
Exploraçao de Parqueamentos, S.A. had goodwill of 14,393 thousands of euros.

This goodwill assigned to intangible fixed assets has generated a deferred tax amounting to 26.5 % of 33,279
thousands of euros, which has resulted in a larger Goodwill for this amount. This tax will revert annually according to
the amortisation of goodwill assigned to the intangible fixed assets.

The accounting of this business combination was carried out in the consolidated annual reports of financial year 2009,
since the valuation of acquired assets and liabilities undertaken had not been completed, nor had the twelve month
period set by IFRS-EU 3 yet elapsed: “Business combinations” used to complete said valuation. During the year 2010,
the final valuation of these assets has been carried out. (See note 1.2).

**_Methodology for allocating goodwill_**

The cash flow discounts for each of Emparque’s contracts have been carried out in order to reach the cash flow
discount value of each contract.

To this value, the investments required for maintaining these assets in good operating conditions as well as the
structure costs required for proper operation have been subtracted.

This value is higher than the purchase price by 34,711 thousands of euros. This amount has been proportionally
allocated to each asset depending on their value.

On the other hand, based on the company’s experience, it is believed that about 75% of the current contracts will be
renewed. Additionally, the capability of the company for managing new contracts has been assessed.

These two variables together have been assigned to the remaining Goodwill in accordance with the following table:

**Thousands of euros**


-----

Value assigned to assets ................................................................................................................... 34,711

Value of renewals and new contracts ................................................................................................ 81,809

TOTAL................................................................................................................................................ **116,520**

**_Impairment tests_**

The Group undertakes an annual procedure in order to identify any possible deficit in the registered cost with regard to
the recoverable value of goodwill.

In the case of the goodwill of Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A. and Balsol 2001, S.A., and this procedure is
performed by analysing the assets available to the company at the time of its acquisition and which gave rise to the
recognised goodwill, these being individual car parks.

Any possible impairment is calculated by comparing the value of these assets with their fair value, the latter
understood as the value of the future cash flow discounts which it is estimated that the assets will generate, based on
objective hypotheses, discounted at an estimated capital cost based on a risk-free rate using the 30-year bond as a
benchmark, and the level of risk of the asset, along with an estimated market premium.

Additionally, a residual value is calculated, incorporating the renewal of the contract and growth.

In the case of Dornier SAU, the goodwill corresponding to the Group as a whole is analysed, this being the
corresponding cash generating unit.

Any possible impairment is calculated by comparing the Group’s book value (shareholder equity plus value of net
goodwill) with its fair value, the latter understood as the price for which it could be sold between independent parties,
less any possible costs tied to such a sale, and provided that this fair value can be estimated in a reliable manner, in
other words if the Group in which the stake is held is actively listed on an organised financial market, or there exists
some transaction between independent parties which could serve as a benchmark; a residual value is furthermore
calculated, incorporating the renewal of the contract and growth.

No indications of impairment in the existing goodwill were uncovered.

loan signed on 27 July 2009, in the sum of 400,343 thousands of euros. Of theses 400,343 thousands of euros,

The total amount is divided into three different loans:

Facility A is an amortizing which begins to be paid in 2011, and matures in 2016. Facility B is a Bullet; in other words,
the entire loan is paid off when it matures in 2017.

The Capex is divided into TC1 and TC2, the total amount is 72 millions of euros, which can be made available to pay
for investments. In 2010, 30 millions of euros are made available and 42 millions of euros remain pending. TC1 is an
amortizing loan, which like Facility A starts to be paid off in 2011 and matures in 2016; TC2 is a Bullet and is paid off
when it matures in 2017.

The syndicated loan serves several purposes:

1. – Finance the acquisition of Empark Portugal.

2. – Refinance Cintra Group’s existing debt.

3. – Refinance Empark Portugal Group’s existing debt.

4. – Finance part of the Groups investment plan in 2009, 2010 and 2011.

On 10 July 2009, the Group sold their 50% holding in company Serranopark, S.A. in the sum of 521 thousands of
euros. Said holding had been previously valued at 9,030 thousands of euros and therefore, a loss of 8,509 thousands
of euros was incurred as can be seen in line “Impairment and result through disposal of fixed assets” of the
Consolidated Income Account.

The Group considers that these losses are justified and therefore, that it is tax deductible; however, following a
prudent criteria, said loss has not been applied to the taxable base sum, notwithstanding that afterwards, the Group
may take benefit from the tax deduction relative to this loss.

The temporary differences correspond to 43 thousands of euros of amortisation adjustment. During the 1995 financial
year the Group took advantage of Royal Legislative Decree 2/1995, on the freedom of amortisation for employmentgenerating investments, amortising for tax purposes the La Concepción car park administrative concession to the level
of 67.62%. Over the lifespan of the concession the adjustment made through the difference between the book and tax
amortisations is gradually recovered.

At the companies Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A. and Dornier, S.A.U., Corporation Tax for the year 2005
was opened for inspection in January 2008, along with the remaining taxes from the same financial year. The
inspectors requested an extension to the period of operations in December 2008, meaning that the gathering and
tracking of data is still being performed by the inspectors. Based on the criteria which the tax authorities could adopt
regarding the years open to inspection, contingent tax liabilities not open to objective quantification could arise,
although the Company does not believe these will be greater than the assumptions made.

The inspectors requested an extension to the operational period for a further year, as the gathering and tracking of
data was at that time still in progress.

**28. Information regarding payment postponements to suppliers**

_1 – Income generated by off-street car parks_

Revenue from off-street car parks corresponds to revenues generated through the use of parking spaces owned by
the Group or held under an administrative concession. Off-street car park revenues are recorded when the hourly
parking rate is paid and, in the case of season ticket-holders, on an accrual basis.

_2 – Revenue generated through the sale of residents’ parking spaces_

This business involves the construction of car parks whose spaces are sold directly to the end customer during the
timeframe of the concession. The sales and costs are not recorded until the parking space is delivered, which
coincides with the signature of the contract.

_3 – Revenue generated by off-street car parks (ORA)_

Revenue from the ORA parking meter service is mainly based on the sum corresponding to the cost of providing the
service plus a percentage, generally between 1% and 3%, of the surplus between that cost and the funds collected.
On some ORA contracts, the revenue is earned at a fixed rate (service cost), entirely irrespective of the funds
collected, which are in all cases paid over to the City Council. This is recorded in the accounts at the time when the
service is provided.


-----

The Group also specialises in the provision of other services tied to the end-to-end management of car parking and
urban and inter-urban mobility, such as: Management of control of access to nature reserves, provision of temporary
parking services at trade fairs and mass attendance events, combined park and bus services around airports.

Object: An appeal is filed jointly A) the Agreement from the Local City Council dated 9 December 2009 by which it is
decided to pay (i) the fee for operating the municipal parking spaces of Plaza Lluis Millet corresponding to financial
years 2001 to 2008 and (ii) the fixed and variable fee for the concession for operating the blue zones of the

decision dated 27 April 2010, issued by the applicable court, which agrees to extend the current contentious –
administrative appeal to the aforementioned ruling.

Status of the proceedings: The plaintiff has made conclusions and a subpoena of the plaintiff is pending for her to
present these written conclusions.

2.– Major proceedings brought by Huarte, S.A. against Ferrovial Aparcamientos, S.A., Vista Desarrollo, S.A., Caixa
Penedés, CARIPLO and Bolsa de Madrid requesting the cancellation of the collateral judgement of 850,614 shares of
ESSA (today Cintra Aparcamientos, S.A.).

A favourable sentence has been obtained for the claims of Empark Aparcamientos y Servicios, S.A. and other
defendants and therefore this lawsuit should be considered concluded after the Supreme Court ruling dated
10 December 2008. To the extent that judgement against the plaintiff for court fees as been entered, Empark has
submitted three requests for calculating court fees, one for each case, by which a claim is made against Obrascón
Huarte Laín, S.A. (OHL) for the payment of Lawyer and Solicitor fees. The solicitor fees amount to approximately
80,000 euros and the Lawyer fees amount to 74 thousands of euros and 31 thousands of euros for the 1st and 2nd
Instances respectively and 192 thousands of euros for the Supreme Court.

On the other hand, Counsel Mr. Félix López Antón, who assumed the defence of Empark’s interests in different
instances of this proceeding, presented three proceedings for collecting legal fees against Empark claiming payment
of fees incurred for the 1st instance, the Provincial High Court and the Supreme Court. The fees corresponding to the
1[st] instance and the provincial High court were paid by Empark in October 2010.

The Supreme Court, by means of a court order dated 30 November 2010, and notified on 16 December 2010, has
issued judgement regarding the challenge for fees corresponding to this last instance in the legal Fees Claim report,
proceeding derived from the appeal for Civil Cassation no. 2903/2003, initiated by DESPACHO LÓPEZ ANTON SLP
(Law firm), before the First Chamber of the Supreme Court, claiming 192,460.97 euros for the principle and 1,872.79
euros. The Chamber rejects the challenge for fees as undue and finds the challenge for said fees as excessive,
setting the amount to 44 thousands of euros. Subtracting the amount of 10 thousand euros, which had been
previously deposited by Empark, the amount remaining to settle is 33 thousand euros.

**Economic activity for the financial year**

Over the course of the 2010 financial year, the Company engaged in its business within an economic context
complicated as a result of the worldwide financial and economic crisis. This crisis has caused an important decrease
in economic and financial activity, which has also been noticed in Spain and Portugal, which are the group’s main
markets.

In spite of this crisis, the performance of the Empark Group has been very positive, showing a great resistance and an
excellent management capacity, which has enabled the group to obtain a recurring EBITDA in 2010 of 69,302
thousands of euros, which continues on the same growth path that was set in previous years.

The group leads the Spanish and car parking Portuguese markets and since 1968, is has been involved in the
construction, management and operation of underground as well as on-street parking.

guarantee that it will be in a position to continue operating as a profitable business, while maximising shareholder
return by striking an optimum balance between debt and equity.

Below are set out the main risks to which the Group is exposed:

- Liquidity risk: The Group establishes its treasury needs as part of its general policy through the use of two tools:
Treasury budget with a 12-month horizon, providing monthly detail and updates, and treasury budget with a 30-day
horizon, with daily updates and details. These tools identify treasury needs in volume and time, and make plans for
new financing needs.

- Credit risk: The Group maintains cash and equivalent liquid assets at financial institutions with a high-level credit
rating. It should furthermore be mentioned that there is no significant concentration of credit risk with third parties.


-----

has contracted financial instruments that partially cover the risk of possible interest rate hikes.

- Exchange rate risk: The Group has no significant exchange rate risk, as most of its assets and liabilities, revenue
and expenses, are quoted in euros.

**Financial debt**

The Group’s debt as of 31 December 2010 amounts to 480,636 thousands of euros, which is 63% of the total liability
and it is considered a reasonable debt for this type of company.

**Subsequent events**

There are no relevant events to point out except:

- On 3 February 2011, the cancellation of the mortgage guarantees provided over the commercial property No. 5
located on the bottom floor of the building known as Mercado de Marbella was signed with Banco Espirito Santo de
Investimento, S.A. and rest of banks.

- On 19 January 2011, a judgement has been handed down rejecting the contentious administrative appeal
731/2009-F brought by the company against the City Council of San Cugat. Said judgement has not been appealed
by the company, which is why payment in the sum of 563 thousands of euros has been paid to the City Council.
This payment did not entail expenditure for the company since it already had been provisioned.

**Research and development**

The Group has not carried out any research and development activities.

**Treasury stock**

There have been no acquisitions of own shares.

**Derivatives**

The Group has contracted financial instruments that partially cover the risk of possible interest rate hikes of long-term
outside resources.

**Environmental aspects**

Environmental activity is defined as any operation whose main purpose is to prevent, reduce or repair damage caused
to the environment.

The investments derived from environmental activities are valued at the acquisition cost and are activated as greater
fixed asset expenses in the financial year in which they are incurred, following the criteria described in note 2
regarding applicable accounting standards.

Costs derived from environmental protection and improvement is attributed to the results for the financial year in which
they are incurred, irrespective of the point when the monetary or financial flow derived there from occurs.

The provisions relative to probable or certain responsibilities, legal proceedings in process and for compensation and
pending obligations of an undetermined amount, of an environmental nature not covered by contracted insurance
policies, are made when the liability or the obligation establishing the compensation becomes effective.

At 31 December 2010, the costs or expenses incurred with regard to environmental aspects are insignificant.

As for any such potential contingencies as may arise in the field of the environment, the directors do not believe that
they would have any significant impact on the enclosed annual accounts.
