**Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors: The debt securities described in the Offering Memorandum are not intended**
to be offered, sold, distributed or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold, distributed or otherwise made
available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a
retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); (ii) a customer within
the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as amended or superseded, the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that
customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified
investor as defined in Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (the “Prospectus Regulation”). Consequently, no key information document
required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the debt securities
described in the Offering Memorandum or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared


-----

and therefore offering or selling such debt securities or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may
be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

The Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes referred to therein in any Member State
will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers
of the securities referred to therein. Accordingly, any person making or intending to make an offer in a Member State of Notes
which are the subject of the offering contemplated in the Offering Memorandum may only do so in circumstances in which no
obligation arises for the Issuer or any of the Initial Purchasers to publish a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus
Regulation, in each case, in relation to such offer. Neither the Issuer nor the Initial Purchasers have authorized, nor do they
authorize, the making of any offer of the securities in circumstances in which an obligation arises for the Issuer (as defined
herein) or the Initial Purchasers to publish a prospectus for such offer.

**Prohibition of Sales to U.K. Retail Investors: The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to**
and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom (the “U.K.”). For these
purposes, a “retail investor” means a person who is one (or more) of the following: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of
Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act
2018 (as amended, the “EUWA”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations
made under the FSMA to implement the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a
professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by
virtue of the EUWA; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of
domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “U.K. Prospectus Regulation”). Consequently, no key information document required
by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “U.K. PRIIPs Regulation”) for
offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the U.K. has been prepared and therefore
offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the U.K. may be unlawful under the
U.K. PRIIPs Regulation.

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes in the U.K. will be made pursuant to an
exemption under section 86 of the FSMA from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of Notes. This Offering
Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the U.K. Prospectus Regulation.

approval process of the manufacturers, the target market assessment in respect of the securities described in the Offering
Memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for such securities is eligible counterparties (“ECPs”) and
professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of such securities to ECPs clients
are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending such securities (a “distributor”) should take into
consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for
undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of such securities (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’
target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

The Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the securities referred to therein in the UK will be
made pursuant to an exemption under the UK Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of
the securities referred to therein. Accordingly, any person making or intending to make an offer in the UK of the securities
which are the subject of the offering contemplated in the Offering Memorandum may only do so in circumstances in which no
obligation arises for the Issuer or any of the Initial Purchasers to publish a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the UK Prospectus
Regulation, in each case, in relation to such offer. Neither the Issuer nor the Initial Purchasers have authorized, nor do they
authorize, the making of any offer of the securities in circumstances in which an obligation arises for the Issuer or any of the
Initial Purchasers to publish a prospectus for such offer.

approval process of any relevant initial purchaser that considers itself a manufacturer pursuant to the FCA Handbook Product
Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook (the “UK MiFIR Product Governance Rules”) (each a “UK Manufacturer”
and, together, the “UK Manufacturers”), the target market assessment in respect of the securities described in this Offering
Memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is only eligible counterparties as defined in the
Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook, and professional clients, as defined in
Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (“UK MiFIR”); and (ii) all channels for
distribution of the securities to ECPs and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or
recommending the securities (a “UK distributor”) should take into consideration the UK Manufacturers’ target market
assessment; however, a distributor subject to the FCA Handbook Product Intervention and the UK MiFIR Product Governance

the UK Manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Credit ratings are for distribution only to a person (a) who is not a “retail
client” within the meaning of sections 761G or 761GA of the Australian Corporations Act and who is a sophisticated investor,

EG Global Finance plc, a public limited liability company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales (the “Issuer”), is offering (i) €      aggregate principal amount of its           Senior Secured
Notes due 2028 (the “Euro Notes”) and (ii) $          aggregate principal amount of its      Senior Secured Notes due 2028 (the “Dollar Notes” and together with the Euro Notes, the “Notes”).
The Euro Notes will bear interest at a rate of       % per annum and the Dollar Notes will bear interest at a rate of       % per annum. The Notes will mature on       , 2028 (the “Initial Maturity Date”),
_provided that if at the date (a “Determination Date”) that is four months prior to the maturity date of any class of outstanding Specified Indebtedness (as defined herein) which is in an aggregate amount that,_
together with any outstanding Specified Indebtedness in respect of a prior Determination Date, exceeds $250 million (or its equivalent in other currencies) and such amount in excess of $250 million is not repaid,
refinanced (with debt that has a maturity date falling at least 91 days after February 7, 2028) or extended (to a maturity date falling at least 91 days after February 7, 2028) by such Determination Date, the Initial
Maturity Date shall be automatically adjusted to the maturity date of the Specified Indebtedness referred to herein which is the earliest maturity date to follow such Determination Date. The Issuer will pay interest
on the Notes semi-annually in arrears on each of       and       , commencing on       , 2024.
All or a portion of the Dollar Notes and the Euro Notes may be redeemed at any time prior to         , 2025 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Dollar Notes and the Euro Notes
redeemed, as applicable, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts (as defined herein), if any, plus a “make-whole” premium, as described in this offering memorandum (the “Offering

equity offerings at a redemption price equal to         % and         %, respectively, of the principal amount thereof, in each case plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, provided
that at least 50% of the aggregate principal amount of the Dollar Notes or the Euro Notes, as applicable, (in each case, including any additional Dollar Notes or additional Euro Notes, as the case may be) remain
outstanding after the redemption. The Notes may be redeemed at any time on or after         , 2025, at the redemption prices set forth in this Offering Memorandum.
Upon the occurrence of certain defined events constituting a change of control, each holder of Notes of any series may require the Issuer to repurchase all or a portion of its Notes at a price equal to 101% of their
principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. In the event of certain developments affecting taxation, the Issuer may elect to redeem
all, but not less than all, of the Notes, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof (including accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any).
The Notes will be senior secured obligations of the Issuer and will rank senior in right of payment to all of the Issuer’s existing and future debt that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes and
will rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer that is not so subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, including the obligations under the Senior Credit
Facilities Agreement, the Existing Notes and the Second Lien Credit Facilities Agreement (each as defined herein), certain hedging obligations, if any, and certain other future senior indebtedness permitted to be
incurred under the Indenture. The Notes will be guaranteed on or around the Issue Date by the Parent and the other Guarantors (as defined herein) on a senior basis and subject to the Agreed Security Principles
(as defined herein). The Guarantees (as defined herein) will rank senior in right of payment to the respective Guarantor’s existing and future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to such
Guarantee and will rank pari passu in right of payment with the respective Guarantor’s existing and future indebtedness that is not so subordinated, including such Guarantor’s obligations under the Senior Credit
Facilities Agreement, the Existing Notes and the Second Lien Credit Facilities Agreement. Subject to and without prejudice to the below with reference to the Italian Law Share Pledge (as defined below), the
Notes and the guarantees thereof (the “Guarantees”) will be secured within 90 days of the Conditions Satisfaction Date (as defined herein), by security interests to be granted or reconfirmed over the Collateral
(as defined herein), subject to the Agreed Security Principles. The Collateral also secures the liabilities under the Senior Credit Facilities and Existing Notes on an equal and ratable basis and the liabilities under
the Second Lien Credit Facilities on a junior basis, in each case subject to the Intercreditor Agreement. The validity, enforceability and, in respect of the security interests over the Collateral, priority and ranking
of the Guarantees and the security interests and the liability of the Guarantors, are subject to the limitations described in “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability
_of the Guarantees and the Security Interests.” The Notes and the Guarantees will be structurally subordinated to all obligations of the subsidiaries of EG Group Limited (the “Parent”) that do not guarantee the_
Notes and effectively subordinated to any existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer and the Guarantors that is secured by property or assets that do not secure the Notes, to the extent of the value of such
property and assets.
As soon as reasonably practicable and no later than 10 business days following the Issue Date, we will submit an application with the Italian Golden Power Authority (as defined herein) pursuant to the Italian
Golden Power Legislation (as defined herein) in order for the Italian Law Share Pledge (as defined below) to be extended as security for the Notes and Guarantees. On the date that is the later of (a) 90 days
following the Conditions Satisfaction Date and (b) 10 days following receipt of the Italian Golden Power Clearance (as defined herein), the Notes and Guarantees will be secured by first-ranking security interests
(to be granted or reconfirmed and extended) over all of the issued shares of EG Italia S.p.A. (the “Italian Law Share Pledge”), subject to the Agreed Security Principles and the Intercreditor Agreement.

restrictions.

be granted or that such listing will be maintained. The Exchange is not a regulated market for the purposes of MiFID II or UK MiFIR (each as defined below).

Issue Price of the Euro Notes:       % plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, from the Issue Date.

made certain acknowledgments, representations and agreements. See “Notice to Investors.”

This Offering Memorandum is being provided (1) to U.S. investors that the Issuer reasonably believes to be QIBs under Rule
144A for informational use solely in connection with their consideration of the purchase of the Notes and (2) to investors
outside the United States who are not U.S. persons in connection with offshore transactions complying with Rule 903 or Rule

with, recommended by or approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), any state securities
commission in the United States or any other securities commission or regulatory authority, nor has the SEC, any state securities
commission in the United States or any such securities commission or authority passed upon the accuracy or adequacy of this
Offering Memorandum. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.

**NOTICE TO CERTAIN EUROPEAN INVESTORS**

**United Kingdom**

This Offering Memorandum is for distribution only to, and is directed solely at, persons who (i) are outside the United
Kingdom, (ii) are investment professionals, as such term is defined in Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act
2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005, as amended (the “Financial Promotion Order”), (iii) are persons falling within Articles
49(2)(a) to (d) of the Financial Promotion Order or (iv) are persons to whom an invitation or inducement to engage in
investment banking activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000) in connection

**_UK MiFIR Product Governance / Professional Investors and ECPs Only Target Market_**

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the Notes
has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is only eligible counterparties, as defined in the FCA Handbook
Conduct of Business Sourcebook (“COBS”), and professional clients, as defined in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms
part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“UK MiFIR”); and (ii) all channels for
distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering,
selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturer’s target market
assessment; however, a distributor subject to the FCA Handbook Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook
(the “UK MiFIR Product Governance Rules”) is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the
Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturer’s target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution
channels.

**_Prohibition of sales to UK retail investors_**

The securities described in the attached Offering Memorandum are not intended to be offered, sold, distributed or otherwise
made available to and should not be made available to and should not be offered, sold, distributed or otherwise made available
to any retail investor in the United Kingdom. For the purposes of this paragraph, a “retail investor” means a person who is one
(or more) of: (i) a “retail client,” as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of UK
domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as amended, the “EUWA”); (ii) a “customer” within the
meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement the Insurance
Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a “professional client,” as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1)
of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (“UK MiFIR”); or (iii) not a
“qualified investor” as defined in Article 2 of the UK Prospectus Regulation, and the expression an offer includes the
communication in any form and by any means of sufficient information on the terms of the offer and the debt securities to be
offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe for such debt securities. Consequently, no key information
document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (as amended,
the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering, selling or distributing the debt securities described in the Offering Memorandum or
otherwise making them available to retail investors in the United Kingdom has been prepared and, therefore, offering, selling


-----

or distributing the debt securities or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom may be
unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes in the UK will be made pursuant to an
exemption under Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK Prospectus
_Regulation”) from a requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of Notes. This offering memorandum is not a prospectus for_
the purpose of the UK Prospectus Regulation.

**European Economic Area**

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of Notes in any member state of the European
Economic Area (each, a “Member State”) will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the
requirement to produce a prospectus for offers of the Notes. Accordingly, any person making or intending to make any offer
within a Member State of Notes, which are the subject of the offering contemplated in this Offering Memorandum, may only
do so in circumstances in which no obligation arises for the Issuers or the Initial Purchasers to produce a prospectus for such
offer. Neither the Issuers nor the Initial Purchasers have authorized, nor do they authorize, the making of any offer of Notes in
circumstances in which an obligation arises for the Issuers or the Initial Purchasers to publish a prospectus for such offer.
Neither the Issuers nor the Initial Purchasers have authorized, nor do they authorize, the making of any offer of Notes through
any financial intermediary, other than offers made by the Initial Purchasers, which constitute the final placement of Notes
contemplated in this Offering Memorandum. The expression “Prospectus Regulation” means Regulation (EU) 2017/1129.

**_Professional Investors and ECPs Only Target Market_**

Solely for the purposes of the product approval process of each of the manufacturers, the target market assessment in respect
of the debt securities described in this Offering Memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for such debt
securities is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID
II”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of such debt securities to eligible counterparties and professional clients are
appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending such debt securities (a “distributor”) should take into
consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for
undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of such debt securities (by either adopting or refining the
manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**_Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors_**

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made
available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a
retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97
(as amended or superseded, the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional
client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus
Regulation. Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs
Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been
prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may
be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

**Belgium**

of the Prospectus Regulation. This Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer or solicitation to the public in Belgium

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION**

**Presentation of Financial Information**

We present in this Offering Memorandum certain financial information for the Parent and its subsidiaries, including historical
information for the Group, which consists of the Parent and its subsidiaries. The financial information presented in this Offering
Memorandum includes certain audited and unaudited financial statements, non-IFRS and non-GAAP financial information,
operating segment information and other information, each as set forth below. For an overview of the entities in the Group, see
“Summary—Summary Corporate and Financing Structure.”

The Issuer is a subsidiary of the Parent with no revenue-generating activities of its own or material business operations, and its
only earnings have been amounts received in respect of the offering of the Murray Notes and the offering of the Existing Cirrus
Notes. Following the Offering, the Issuer will not have any material assets and its only material liabilities will be its liabilities
under the Existing Notes and the Notes, each as described elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. The Issuer was
incorporated on March 20, 2019.

**_Historical Financial Information_**

We present in this Offering Memorandum the historical financial statements listed below (together, the “Historical Financial
Statements”):

  - the audited consolidated financial statements of EG Group as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021, which are
presented in accordance with IFRS, including the independent auditors’ report thereon (the “2021 EG Group Audited
Financial Statements”);

  - the audited consolidated financial statements of EG Group as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, which are
presented in accordance with IFRS, including the independent auditors’ report thereon (the “2022 EG Group Audited
Financial Statements” and, together with the 2021 EG Group Audited Financial Statements, the “EG Group Audited
Financial Statements”); and

  - The condensed unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of EG Group as of and for the six months ended
June 30, 2023, which include comparative data for the six months ended June 30, 2022, prepared in accordance with
IAS 34 (the “EG Group Unaudited Financial Statements” and, together with the EG Group Audited Financial
Statements, the “EG Group Financial Statements”).

This Offering Memorandum includes unaudited financial information for the 12 months ended June 30, 2023, which is
calculated by adding the results of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2023 to the results of operations for the year
ended December 31, 2022 and subtracting the results of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2022. The unaudited
financial information for the 12 months ended June 30, 2023 has not been audited or reviewed by our auditors, is not required
by or presented in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles and has been prepared for
illustrative purposes only for purposes of this Offering Memorandum. The unaudited consolidated financial information for the
12 months ended June 30, 2023 is not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any future period and should
not be used as the basis for, or prediction of, an annualized calculation.

The Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum should be read in conjunction with
the relevant notes thereto. The EG Group Unaudited Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International
Accounting Standard IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting, as adopted for use in the United Kingdom. The accounting policies
adopted are consistent with those of the EG Group Audited Financial Statements.

Information on the scope and basis of presentation of the EG Group Audited Financial Statements and the application of
significant accounting policies is presented in Note 3 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to the 2022 EG Group
Audited Financial Statements. The principal accounting policies, judgements and estimates applied in the EG Group Unaudited
Financial Statements are the same as those applied in the Group’s consolidated financial statements in the 2022 EG Group
Audited Financial Statements.

**_Non-IFRS Financial Measures_**

This Offering Memorandum contains non-IFRS measures and ratios, including Adjusted EBITDA; Adjusted EBITDA before
IFRS 16; Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16; as adjusted gross margin; adjusted free cash flow, adjusted cash
conversion ratio, adjusted cash conversion ratio adjusted for the Pre-Offering Transactions, pro forma adjusted cash conversion


-----

ratio, capital expenditure measures, as adjusted pro forma first lien net senior secured debt; as adjusted pro forma cash interest
expense; as adjusted pro forma net debt; as adjusted pro forma cash and cash equivalents; ratio of as adjusted pro forma first
lien net senior secured debt to Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16; ratio of as adjusted pro forma net debt (net of
unamortized financing costs) to Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16; ratio of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA before
IFRS 16 to as adjusted pro forma cash interest expense; leverage ratio (in each case, as defined herein) and other measures and
ratios that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting standards.
Unless otherwise specified, all figures presented on a pro forma basis have been presented as of or for the twelve months ended
June 30, 2023.

We present non-IFRS measures because we believe that they and similar measures are widely used by certain investors,
securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measures of performance and liquidity.

The non-IFRS measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and have limitations as
analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported
under IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting standard. These non-IFRS measures and ratios are not measurements
of our performance or liquidity under IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting standards and should not be considered
as alternatives to revenue or net profit for the period or any other performance measures derived in accordance with IFRS or
any other generally accepted accounting principles or as alternatives to cash flows from operating, investing or financing
activities.

The non-IFRS measures we present may also be defined differently than the corresponding terms under the Indenture. The
non-IFRS measures have limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation, or as an alternative to, or
a substitute for, profit/(loss) for the period or other financial statement data presented in our consolidated financial statements
as indicators or financial performance. Some of the limitations of these non-IFRS measures are that:

  - they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;

  - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;

  - they do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary, to service interest or principal
payments on our debt;

  - they do not reflect our tax expenses or the cash that we may be required to pay our taxes;

  - they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our statements of cash flows;

  - they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from certain matters we consider not to be indicative of
our ongoing operations;

  - although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often
need to be replaced in the future and EBITDA-based measures do not reflect any cash requirements that would be
required for such replacements;

  - some of the exceptional items that we eliminate in calculating certain EBITDA-based measures reflect cash payments
that were made, or will in the future be made;

  - other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as
comparative measures; and

  - certain adjustments made in calculating EBITDA-based measures contain estimates that management believes reflect
the underlying results of operations and therefore are subjective in nature.

Furthermore, you should carefully consider the risks and limitations of the non-IFRS financial measures, as they are based in
part on management’s assumptions regarding the future impact of actions that have not yet been implemented. For example,
there is a risk that the synergies that we seek to achieve may not be realized in the anticipated time frame and that the magnitude
of cost savings may be less than expected.


-----

**_As Adjusted Financial Information_**

This Offering Memorandum includes certain unaudited financial and operating information, presented on an as adjusted basis,
to illustrate the effects of the Transactions as if they had occurred on (i) June 30, 2023, for purposes of as adjusted pro forma
cash and cash equivalents, as adjusted pro forma first lien net senior secured debt and as adjusted pro forma net debt and (ii)
July 1, 2022, for purposes of as adjusted pro forma cash interest expense. This Offering Memorandum includes certain
unaudited financial and operating information, presented on an as adjusted basis, to illustrate the effects of the UK Disposal to
Asda, the Non-Core Asset Disposals and the U.S. Sale and Leaseback as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021, the
year ended December 31, 2022, the six months ended June 30, 2022, the six months ended June 30, 2023 and the twelve months
ended June 30, 2023 for certain of our financial and non-financial KPIs (the “Perimeter Adjusted Information”). The Perimeter
Adjusted Information (i) removes the results of operations and financial information for the Disposed Businesses, including
any shared services costs allocated to the Disposed Businesses, from the Group’s results of operations or relevant operating
metric and (ii) illustrates the effects of the U.S. Sale and Leaseback as if it had occurred on January 1, 2021 for purposes of
calculating as adjusted rent expense.

In relation to the Non-Core Minit Mart Disposal (Kentucky and Tennessee), the C-Store site numbers presented in this Offering
Memorandum, when adjusted for the Transactions or the Pre-Offering Transactions, are adjusted for the sale of 63 sites, which
include the 55 sites we have sold as of November 3, 2023 and an additional eight sites which are held for sale and for which
we are actively looking for a buyer. We will continue to evaluate our strategic options in relation to the remaining two sites.
The financial calculations in this Offering Memorandum in relation to the Non-Core Minit Mart Disposal (Kentucky and
Tennessee) that are adjusted for the Transactions or the Pre-Offering Transactions have been adjusted for the sale of the full 65
sites. See “Summary—The Transactions— Non-Core Minit Mart Disposal (Kentucky and Tennessee).”

We have not purported to adjust our financial information presented in this Offering Memorandum to give effect to the strategic
disposals currently under considerations in the United Kingdom, which remain subject to contract and definitive
documentation. See “Recent Developments” and “Summary Consolidated Historical and As Adjusted Financial Information—
_Other Financial and Operating Data.”_

Such unaudited as adjusted information set forth in this Offering Memorandum is based on available information and certain
assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable and may differ materially from the amounts that would have been
achieved had the events above actually occurred at the beginning of the period presented.

The unaudited as adjusted information is for informational purposes only and is not intended to represent or to be indicative of
the consolidated results of operations or financial position we would have reported had the foregoing events been completed at
the beginning of the period presented. The unaudited as adjusted financial information should not be taken as indicative of our
future consolidated results of operations or financial position. Our historical results may not be indicative of our future results
following completion of the Transactions. Neither the assumptions underlying such adjustments nor the resulting unaudited as
adjusted information have been audited or prepared in accordance with any generally accepted accounting standards.

The unaudited as adjusted financial information should be read in conjunction with the information contained in “Use of
_Proceeds,” “EG Group’s Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations” and the_
Historical Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

**Foreign Currencies and Functional Currency**

The individual financial statements of each subsidiary of the Parent are prepared in the currency of the primary economic
environment in which it operates (its functional currency). For the purpose of the EG Group Financial Statements, the results
and financial position of the Group are expressed in U.S. Dollars, the presentational currency for the Group and its consolidated
financial statements.

The assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations are translated into the Group’s presentational currency at exchange
rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Profits and losses are translated at average exchange rates for the relevant accounting
period. Exchange differences arising are recognized in the Group statement of comprehensive income/(loss) and are included
in the Group’s translation reserve. Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency
at the exchange rates prevailing on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are retranslated into the functional currency at the rates of exchange at the reporting date. Exchange differences on
monetary items are recognized in the income statement. Intragroup loans are translated at the year-end exchange rate with the
resulting exchange differences recognized within finance costs. Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the
acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Exchange differences arising are recognized in other comprehensive income.


-----

Unless otherwise specified, non-U.S. dollar amounts referenced in this Offering Memorandum have been converted to a U.S.
dollar-equivalent amount using a EUR/USD exchange rate of $1.08660 per €1.00, GBP/USD exchange rate of $1.26602 per
£1.00 and AUD/USD exchange rate $0.66264 per A$1.00, as applicable, based on the spot rates as at June 30, 2023, as reported
by the European Central Bank.

**Key Performance Indicators**

Certain key performance indicators and other non-financial operating data included in this Offering Memorandum are derived
from management estimates and are not part of our financial statements or our accounting records. Our use or computation of
these measures may not be comparable to the use or computation of similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
Any or all of these measures should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative measure of performance under IFRS or
any generally accepted accounting standards.

**Rounding**

Certain numerical figures set out in this Offering Memorandum, including financial data and other information presented in
millions, thousands or percentages, have been subject to rounding adjustments and, as a result, the totals of the data in this
Offering Memorandum may vary slightly from the actual arithmetic totals of such information. In addition, as a result of such
rounding, the totals of certain financial information and other information presented in tabular form may differ from the
information that would have appeared in such totals using the unrounded financial information.


-----

**INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA**

In this Offering Memorandum, we rely on and refer to information regarding our business and the market in which we operate
and compete. Certain market data and economic and industry data and forecasts used in this Offering Memorandum were
obtained from governmental and other publicly available information, independent industry publications and reports prepared
by industry consultants. These include information published by Wood Mackenzie Euromonitor International, the Australian
Association of Convenience Stores, the Australian Government Department of the Environment and Energy, the National
Association of Convenience Stores and the U.S. Energy Information Administration. In considering the industry and market
data included in this Offering Memorandum, prospective investors should note that this information may be subject to
significant uncertainty due to differing definitions of the relevant markets and market segments described. In many cases, there
is no readily available external information (whether from trade associations, government bodies or other organizations) to
validate market-related analyses and estimates, thus requiring us to rely on internally developed data. Consequently, we have
made our estimates largely based on internal surveys and studies. In the absence of such information, we have made statements
regarding our industry and market share based on our experience, our own investigation of market conditions and our
management’s best estimates. While we believe our estimates to be reliable, they have not been verified by any independent
sources and we cannot assure you that any of our assumptions are accurate or correctly reflect our position in the industry.
Neither we nor any of the Initial Purchasers make any representation as to the accuracy of such information.


-----

**FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**

This Offering Memorandum contains and refers to certain forward-looking statements with respect to our financial condition,
results of operations and business. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on
management’s current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause
actual results, performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking
statements include, among others, statements concerning the potential exposure to market risks and statements expressing
management’s expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, intentions, estimates, forecasts, projections and assumptions. All
statements other than statements of historical fact are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements.

Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,”
“intend,” “may,” “plan,” “objectives,” “outlook,” “probably,” “project,” “will,” “seek,” “target” and other words of similar
meaning in connection with a discussion of future operating or financial performance. All of these forward-looking statements
are based on estimates and assumptions made by such entities that, although believed to be reasonable, are inherently uncertain.
Therefore, undue reliance should not be placed upon any forward-looking statements. There are important factors that could
cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements. In addition, even if our
actual results are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this Offering Memorandum, those results or
developments may not be indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods. For example, factors that could cause
our actual results to vary from projected future results include, but are not limited to:

  - an economic downturn, rising interest rates or a significant deterioration in macroeconomic conditions;

  - fluctuations in the cost price of fuel, including due to geopolitical events, such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine;

**Overview**

We are a leading independent global convenience retailer that served over 1.1 billion customers worldwide in the year
ended December 31, 2022 (over 3 million customers per day). We have a diversified portfolio of sites across three
continents, which consists of 5,937 sites after giving effect to the Transactions. Based on our site count (after giving
effect to the Transactions), we are the third largest independent convenience retailer chain globally, the fifth largest
in the United States and the second largest in Continental Europe and Australia.

Our total fuel volumes sold was 17.7 billion liters for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 (16.1 billion liters after
giving effect to the Transactions). Our global operations span six of the ten largest fuel markets in Europe by fuel
volumes sold, namely Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, all six states in
Australia and 30 states across the United States. Our Fuel operations are complemented by our Grocery & Merchandise
and Foodservice operations, under which we offer our proprietary brands as well as partner with attractive third-party
brands. We seek to deliver a modern and convenient customer retail experience by providing a “one-stop shop” retail
destination that offers a broad range of products and services to address evolving customer needs, which increasingly
revolve around conveniently located stores offering one-stop solutions. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2023,
we generated revenue of $26.2 billion, gross profit of $3.8 billion and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16
of $1,147 million, in each case after giving effect to the Pre-Offering Transactions.

**Industry Overview**

The global C-Store industry has three primary components: fuel, grocery & merchandise and foodservice. The industry
is large and highly fragmented, and in recent years has experienced a number of divestitures from major fuel producers
and/or refiners, grocery retailers, independent operators and chains.

In recent years, C-Stores have improved the range of non-fuel products and services, such as grocery & merchandise
and foodservice offerings. In 2022, in the countries in which we currently operate, the grocery & merchandise market
had sales of $276 billion and the foodservice market had sales of $1,008 billion. We expect that non-fuel sales will
continue to grow as consumers remain focused on convenience and “one-stop” shopping solutions. During 2020 and
the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, convenience sales in the countries in which we currently operate increased
2.0% and saw continued growth into 2021, growing at 2.9% according to Euromonitor International. During 2020 and
the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, foodservice sales in the countries in which we currently operate decreased
by 24.7% due to COVID-19 pandemic-related restrictions, but saw subsequent increases of 15.9% and 25.9% in 2021
and 2022, respectively, according to Euromonitor International.

Retail fuel consumption in the countries in which we currently operate totaled 668 billion liters in 2022, showing yearon-year growth but not matching or exceeding volumes before the COVID-19 pandemic. The fuel market experienced
volatility recently due to macroeconomic events, including the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
During 2020 and the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, retail fuel consumption in the countries in which we currently
operate totaled 607 billion liters, a 13.7% decrease from 2019. As COVID-19- pandemic-related restrictions eased in
2021, retail fuel consumption in the countries in which we currently operate totaled 660 billion liters, an 8.7% increase
from 2020, before reaching 668 billion liters in 2022. We expect fuel volumes within our current operating geographies
to decrease slightly in the near future, largely driven by anticipated vehicle efficiency improvements, an expected
decline in average vehicle travel distance (which we believe is due to changing consumer behavior after the COVID19 pandemic) and an increase in the number of electric vehicles. This decline is expected to be partially offset by

IFRS 16 by geographic region (in each case, after giving effect to the Pre-Offering Transactions and deducting shared
service costs):

  - In the United States, for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, our gross profit was $1,841 million and our
Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16 was $465 million. In comparison, our gross profit was $1,850 million and
our Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16 was $488 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.

  - In Europe, for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, our gross profit was $1,582 million and our Adjusted
EBITDA before IFRS 16 was $378 million. In comparison, our gross profit was $1,567 million and our
Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16 was $425 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.

  - In Australia, for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, our gross profit was $400 million and our Adjusted
EBITDA before IFRS 16 was $124 million. In comparison, our gross profit was $414 million and our
Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16 was $132 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.

Fuel prices at the pump can experience some volatility depending on macroeconomic factors, such as inflation and
global oil prices, and this occasionally causes short-term fluctuations in the gross margin we generate per liter of fuel
volume sold. Our long-term gross margin for fuel has been consistently increasing over time, offsetting the impact of
decreasing fuel volumes, the inflation-linked increases in site operating costs and the extreme oil volatility seen in
2022 driven by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. High margin Grocery & Merchandise and Foodservice operations
tend to contribute to increasing customer traffic to our sites, supporting sales volume and margin expansion and
diversifying our profits away from fuel operations.

Our business is highly cash generative and we benefit from limited working capital requirements, with a strong pro
forma adjusted cash conversion ratio of 83% for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 after giving effect to the PreOffering Transactions. Our typically well invested sites require only limited maintenance capital expenditure, which
amounted to $127 million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023.

We believe that our resilience was demonstrated during the COVID-19 pandemic. As our operating countries
experienced lockdown restrictions at different times, we kept operations running in the remaining locations and
applied what we had learned at the affected sites across our network by sharing best practices. We believe this softened
the aggregate financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Group as a whole and strengthened our ability to
adapt to the developing stages of the pandemic.

**Established business models with high percentage of stores owned and operated business by the Group**

Our operating business model has powered the growth of our site network from a single UK site in 2001 to 5,937 sites
across three continents and ten countries (after giving effect to the Transactions). Our growth journey has been
facilitated by our acquisitions and our new-to-industry (“NTI”) opening program. A significant proportion of our sites
are company owned and company operated (“COCO”), which is our preferred model in most countries, and our sites
are typically larger than the average site size in most of the markets in which we operate, allowing us to generate
greater revenue per site. The table below shows how the average annual volume of fuel sold at one of our sites
compares to the average for the relevant region.

**Region** **United States** **Europe** **Australia**
Average annual volume of fuel sold per site (in million liters)[ (1)] ..... 3.4 1.7 3.3

(1) Does not include the average volumes for Luxembourg. Based on fuel volume data from 2022.

(2) Based on fuel volume data from 2022.

(3) Includes the Retained UK&I Business.

We have a dynamic approach to managing our site estate, whereby we can achieve growth in the number of sites we
operate through acquisitions – although we anticipate being highly selective and strategic with respect to these in the
near term – or the development of NTI sites. In addition to growing our site numbers, we continuously look to upgrade

approach to the requirements of each specific site, expand our non-fuel offerings, and to adjust our capital expenditure
and other costs accordingly.

**Attractive fuel and non-fuel offerings underpinned by long term relationships with key brands**

A majority of our sites have branded retail “one-stop” backcourts that seek to satisfy the multiple needs of our
customers. In addition to fuel, these sites offer a wide range of food and non-food products specifically tailored to
address the everyday household needs and preferences of its local customers.

We continuously review our brand portfolio and evaluate opportunities to partner with additional leading Fuel,
Grocery & Merchandise and Foodservice brands. Our offering is further complemented by a portfolio of our own
brands, including Cooplands, the UK’s second largest bakery business, Go Fresh, which is present mainly in the
Benelux region, and Cumberland Farms, Fastrac, Certified Oil, Sprint, Kwik Shop, Loaf ‘N Jug, Quik Stop, Tom
Thumb, Turkey Hill and Minit Mart, which are present in the United States.

The Cumberland Farms brand in particular is central to our US strategy, since its brand value is underpinned by the
sizable retail space available at most Cumberland Farms sites. Also, its large warehouse and distribution facilities are
in close proximity to our other US sites providing opportunities to grow this brand. Following the Cumberland Farms
Acquisition in October 2019, we have been able to leverage Cumberland Farms’ food production capability and private
label brands, including its Farmhouse Kitchen brand, to expand our capacity to offer our customers competitively
priced alternatives to global and regional brands, increasing the attractiveness and variety of our fresh food offerings
and providing us with a greater number of products that are exclusively available from our stores to further
differentiate us from our competitors. As part of our efforts to leverage this brand, we took the decision at the end of
2021 to commence a rebranding program of a number of sites in the United States from our Tom Thumb brand to our
Cumberland Farms brand, with 26 being completed during 2022 and an additional five in the six months ended June
30, 2023.

We proactively engage and work with well-known regional and global retail brand partners to deliver Fuel, Grocery
& Merchandise and Foodservice offerings that satisfy our customers’ evolving expectations. Brands are deployed on
a site-by-site basis through a selection process driven, in part, by local and regional tastes and preferences. As a result
of the scale and quality of our network and our strong track record as convenience store operators, we are able to
attract well-recognized global and regional brands to partner with us. For instance, we partner with Fuel brands such
as Esso, BP, Shell, Texaco and Ampol, well-known Grocery & Merchandise brands such as SPAR, Carrefour and
Louis Delhaize, and globally recognized Foodservice brands such as Starbucks, KFC, Burger King and Subway, as
well as strong local foodservice brands such as Greggs and Pomme de Pain. We continue to strengthen our brand
partnerships with our Foodservice brand partners with 102 new sites opening in the year ended December 31, 2022, a
demonstration of our commitment to expand the brand offerings.

As direct operators of the third-party branded stores, outlets and concessions located at our sites, we act as brand
ambassadors for our partners, which we believe reflects the trust our partners have in our operational capabilities. We
believe these valuable and well-known brands increase customer confidence in our products and services, leading to
higher customer traffic and sales volume, which in turn tends to strengthen our existing partnerships and increase our
attractiveness to other leading brands. The following tables provide an overview of our key Fuel, Grocery &
Merchandise and Foodservice brand partnerships as well as our proprietary brands (after giving effect to the
Transactions):

**High quality real estate portfolio**

Our retail network consists of 5,937 sites after giving effect to the Transactions across the globe, many of which are
strategically located in high traffic areas. These include 3,719 company-owned sites after giving effect to the
Transactions, comprising freehold sites, leasehold sites, as well as sites that are partially freehold and partially
leasehold and concession sites. Our concession sites give us the right to develop these sites according to the terms of
the development proposal we provided to the respective seller during the open bid process.

A large proportion of our real estate portfolio in the United States and Europe consists of freehold or long leasehold
sites. As of June 30, 2023, after giving effect to the Transactions, 30% of our property portfolio based on the number
of sites was freehold, comprising 1,795 sites, 56% of our property portfolio based on the number of sites was leasehold
(including long leasehold), comprising 3,342 sites, 1% of our portfolio based on the number of sites was a hybrid of
freehold and leasehold, comprising 68 sites, 9% of our portfolio consisted of third-party sites, comprising 545 sites,
and 3% of our portfolio based on the number of sites was concessions, comprising 187 sites. While the value of our
real estate portfolio fluctuates depending on market conditions and other factors (see “Risk Factors—Ownership and
_leasing of a broad portfolio of real estate exposes us to potential losses and, liabilities and fluctuations in market_
_price”), we believe that our global real estate footprint including a large number of freehold and long leasehold sites_
provide us with long term stability. Despite current market conditions and the interest rate environment leading to
depressed valuations for commercial real estate across Europe and the United States, we still have significant real
estate value underpinning our business. According to the Real Estate Reports, based on current interest rate levels and
market conditions, the aggregated sales price of our properties (after giving effect to the Transactions) is more than
$4.0 billion (equivalent) on the basis that they are fully equipped operational entities and taking into account their
trading potential and EBITDA generation. See “Business—Property—Real Estate Reports.”

The quality of our estate is also complemented by our portfolio of 263 highway and highway-like sites in Europe
(including seven in the United Kingdom after giving effect to the Pre-Offering Transactions). Our highway sites tend
to have higher fuel margins and include Grocery & Merchandise and Foodservice offerings. Most of our highway sites

7

operate under our COCO model, allowing us to benefit from the full margin on Fuel, Grocery & Merchandise and
Foodservice offerings.

Our valuable real estate portfolio also provides a potential source of liquidity. Over the last few months we have been
able to, and in the future may continue to, selectively monetize portions of our real estate portfolio to take advantage
of favorable trading conditions and pursue our strategic priorities, including deleveraging on attractive terms. See “—
_Our Strategies—Rationalization of portfolio and focus on robust capital structure.”_

**Strong management team led by our co-founders**

We have an experienced and dedicated management team focused on sustainable and profitable growth for our
business, with a number of team members having over 25 years of experience with the Group or in the industry. Our
global managers include our visionary founders and co-CEOs, Zuber Issa and Mohsin Issa, who both have extensive
expertise in the convenience retail sector. Following the Issa family’s acquisition of their first site in 2001, they have
led the business to become one of the leading global independent convenience store operators. We believe that the
entrepreneurial spirit of our management team creates a culture focused on long-term, profitable growth and cash
generation.

As disclosed in “Recent Developments,” upon completion of the potential sale to Zuber Issa of the majority of the
Retained UK&I Business, he intends to step down as Co-CEO, remaining on our Board as non-executive director.
Mohsin Issa would then become our sole CEO and would continue leading our strategy going forward, supported by
our strong senior management team responsible for day-to-day operations, including John Carey, President and CEO
of EG America, Imraan Patel, Chief Strategy and Business Officer and Michael Bradley, Chief Financial Officer. John
Carey was appointed President and CEO of EG America with effect from October 1, 2023, with a mandate to drive
forward our growth strategy in the United States, our largest market by both revenue and sites.

Our decentralized management structure is composed of seven country or regional managers, each with extensive
industry experience. They are responsible for day-to-day operations in Australia, the Benelux region, France,
Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and Ireland and the United States. The Nomination Committee of our Board
ensures a robust leadership talent pipeline and succession plans for the Board and senior management are in place,
taking account of risk areas, gender and diversity.

**Our Strategies**

Our strategy is to continue our disciplined approach to growing our market share, enhancing our profitability, ensuring
that our business is run sustainably and generating robust cash flows to drive further deleveraging and investment.

**Focus on growing our market share and optimizing our existing operations and asset base**

We aim to continue to optimize our operations to ensure that we are deriving maximum value and market share from
our existing asset base. We aim to achieve this through organic growth, developing NTI sites in strategic locations
and redeveloping certain sites as part of our KDR program, as well as through continuing to extract synergies from
past acquisitions and, where an attractive opportunity presents itself, undertaking strategic acquisitions or divestments
and realizing value from our real estate portfolio on a disciplined basis. The map below shows our current global
footprint (after giving effect to the Transactions).

United States

In the United States, we operate across 30 states and are the fifth largest independent convenience retailer in the
country, with a scaled coast-to-coast national footprint and various avenues for additional growth.

We believe the U.S. market provides a significant opportunity to focus on our operating initiatives, strengthen our
core business and drive sustainable growth. Going forward, we believe it could provide a blueprint for our global
initiatives to improve performance while minimizing capital spend to support our financial policy goals, focusing on
the following value propositions:

  - Winning Offer: Expand offerings with a focus on dispensed beverage, food and margin enhancing private
label while maintaining a hyper-localized approach to enhance the customer experience.

  - Winning Fuel: Drive volume growth through investment in growing segments (diesel/ B2B) while
maintaining the Group's focus on a premium offering to maximize margin.

  - Winning Customer: Engage with our active customer base through an enhanced omnichannel experience
with a focus on loyalty.

  - Winning Efficiency: Continue to focus on our expansive cost reduction measures to drive enhanced
profitability.

A key aspect of our U.S. strategy is to capitalize on the brand equity of Cumberland Farms, which we plan to do
through store rebranding initiatives as well as expanding Cumberland Farms’ well-developed private label offerings
and food production capacities. As part of these efforts, we have already commenced rebranding a number of our sites
in the United States from our Tom Thumb brand to our Cumberland Farms brand, with 26 such rebrandings being
completed during 2022 and an additional five being completed in the six months ended June 30, 2023. In addition, we
believe there are opportunities to increase the Grocery & Merchandise and Foodservice contribution from our sites
through actions such as price book optimization and reduction of product waste.

We plan to increase our Foodservice offerings in the United States, which accounted for only 3% of our gross profit
in the region for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023. We aim do this both by expanding our proprietary brands as
well as leveraging our existing partnerships with established third-party brands. We also plan to expand our SmartPay

-----

mobile application, as well as deploy our proprietary brands, throughout our non-Cumberland Farms estate. The
SmartPay program is a mobile application which allows us to offer and promote lower retail prices to SmartPay users
in a targeted manner through payment programs and marketing and customer savings promotions. Launched in 2013,
this program has already reached $6 billion in fuel sales and saved members more than $200 million, and we believe
it has significant potential for further growth. In addition, we opened 13 NTI sites in the United States during 2022,
while a further two NTI sites opened this year.

Europe (Continental Europe and United Kingdom and Ireland)

We are the second largest independent fuel and convenience store business in Continental Europe, with a strong
presence in key markets and a significant opportunity for additional growth.

A key part of our European strategy is to invest in our Foodservice and non-fuel offerings in the region. Our efforts to
achieve this include a rollout of well recognized Foodservice brands and outlets across Continental Europe, with 277
such outlets open as of June 30, 2023. Our growth strategy has historically also included pursuing inorganic growth
when the appropriate opportunity presents itself. For instance, we completed the acquisition of OMV’s German
forecourt business, consisting of 285 sites in southern Germany on May 1, 2022, of which 24 were divested as part of
obtaining regulatory approval for the transaction (in addition to 24 of our existing German sites). While we intend to
remain disciplined and focused on reducing net leverage, we continue to follow a disciplined approach to acquisition
opportunities both in existing markets as well as potential new ones, with a focus on driving competency, capability,
scale and balance sheet efficiencies. We also continued our expansion in Europe through additional NTI sites, with
three such sites opening in 2022 and a further four so far this year.

In addition, we recognize the accelerating shift towards alternatively fueled vehicles in Europe and the rest of the
world and plan to accelerate the roll-out of ‘evpoint,’ our proprietary electric vehicle charging proposition throughout
Europe. We had 470 EV chargers across the United Kingdom and Continental Europe at the end of 2022 and have
added a further 192 chargers as of June 30, 2023.

Our European estate also represents the highest proportion of CONCO sites, with 2,202 dealer, franchisee or retailer
operated sites at the end of 2022, largely across Italy and Germany. A key part of our growth strategy for Continental
Europe is to review and identify dealer‑operated sites which we can convert to our preferred COCO model. During
2022, 52 conversions took place and a further 20 took place in the six months ended June 30, 2023. We typically incur
little to no costs in connection with COCO conversions, unless we decide to convert CONCO sites to COCO sites
before our contracts with the relevant dealers, franchisees and retailers expire, in which case we may need to pay early
termination fees.

Australia

We are the second largest independent convenience store retailer by site numbers in Australia and aim to further
consolidate our presence in the region.

Our 525 COCO sites in Australia already include Fuel and Grocery & Merchandise offerings, however, we have been
transforming the network through continued upgrades and rebranding. In 2022, we opened seven NTI stores and have
eight sites currently under construction. We also recently rebranded from Woolworths to EG in our Grocery &
Merchandise stores and from Caltex to Ampol for Fuel.

We are focused on expanding our offers to our customers in Australia and have launched a delivery service across our
network with our delivery partners such as UBER, Menulog and DoorDash. These partnerships have allowed us to
expand our Grocery & Merchandise online offers to include virtual stores under brands such as Eats2U, Olivers and
Ben & Jerry’s. We have also expanded our B2B partnerships and have entered into partnerships with motoring
associations and large consumer organizations such as electricity providers. Through these partnerships, we provide
targeted online fuel offers to these organizations.

**Enhance Foodservice offerings and continue to grow, invest in and realize identified synergies from proprietary**
**Foodservice brands**

An increasingly important part of our strategy is the development of our Foodservice business, especially in light of
the secular growth this sector is expected to experience over the next few years, driven by changing lifestyles and
consumer preferences. Our scaled, global footprint across the Foodservice market, driven by our strong international
brand partnerships and strategic acquisitions, provides us with a strong platform from which to capitalize on this
growth trend.

We have been successfully operating Foodservice outlets for over a decade and we are a partner of choice for many
leading third‑party brands. Across the Group, we will continue to operate 1,201 Foodservice outlets after giving effect
to the Transactions. We believe that there is significant scope to further expand our Foodservice business, especially
since Foodservice offerings on a backcourt platform remain underdeveloped across most countries in which we operate
in terms of the quality and choice provided at most outlets. We are strongly positioned to fill this gap since we are
already a significant operator of scale of Foodservice sites and have established a position as a leading franchisee for
our brand partners. In recent years, our expanded Foodservice operations have transformed our sites into destinations
serving multiple customer needs, which supports an increase in customer traffic and sales volumes, and we intend to
replicate this across selected sites across the Group. This is reflected in the recent growth of our Foodservice gross
profit, which for 2022 was $705 million compared to $614 million in 2021, a year-on-year increase of 15%, and for
the six months ended June 30, 2023 was $389 million, an increase of 10% from the six months ended June 30, 2022.

We have made continued investment in Foodservice outlets globally with a total of 102 new outlets opening in the
year ended December 31, 2022. At the same time, we have continued to invest in and grow our proprietary Foodservice
brand network.

**Pursue a multi-pronged strategy for energy transition**

As the world transitions to a lower carbon future, and the demand for electric vehicles is expected to increase, we
believe the long-term trend towards electrification of vehicles presents a significant opportunity for us, and one which
we are well-positioned to capitalize on given the site network we already own. We have a multi-pronged strategy to
provide EV charging stations (also referred to herein as charge points, charging points or chargers) and alternative
fuels across our platform and a key aspect of this plan is our electric vehicle charging point strategy, in particular
‘evpoint’ – our proprietary branded, ultra-fast electric vehicle charging proposition.

We believe ‘evpoint’ has the potential to become one of Europe’s leading charge point operators. Our flagship location
at Frontier Park in Blackburn, United Kingdom, the home of six ultra-fast chargers, opened in August 2022. We
already installed ‘evpoint’ ultra-fast chargers at over 20 trial sites across the United Kingdom and Continental Europe
in 2022 and a further 33 sites in the first half of 2023. We have also earmarked a broader rollout across hundreds of
our sites through to 2026. The Retained UK&I Business will include all of our EV chargers in the United Kingdom
following the UK Disposal to Asda. With between two and six charging points per site, and innovations in charging
hardware, including load-balancing technology means several customers can use a single location simultaneously.

In the United States, our strategy has been to partner with leading third-party charge point operators on EV charge
points. These partnerships allow us to leverage our network and reach but minimize the need for deploying our own
capital. As such, our EV charge points in the United States will have third party branding, compared to our EV charge
points in Europe that will primarily have our own branding. We currently do not have any near-term plans for an EV
charger roll-out in Australia, but continue to review our strategy in this area.

We have continued our rollout of EV chargers across the United Kingdom and some sites in Continental Europe.
While we will divest most of our roadside locations in the United Kingdom when we complete the UK Disposal to
Asda, we have deliberately retained 31 well-developed sites in the UK to maintain our presence in this mature,
attractive and innovative market and to use our residual footprint there as a platform to test, adapt and fine-tune our
European EV charger offering as well as the introduction of other developing applications.

As of June 30, 2023, we operate 635 electric charging points (compared to just 250 in 2021 and 470 as of
December 31, 2022) across 189 sites in the United Kingdom and Continental Europe and have identified hundreds of
additional sites that, due to their locations and nature, are suitable for additional electric charging points as part of the

11


-----

next wave of site developments through to 2026. We plan to continue our rollout of EV chargers during the remainder
of 2023, with a further 60 electric charging points operating by the end of the year, a majority of which will be ultrafast chargers. We believe one of our key strengths in the EV charging point market lies in our expansive forecourt
footprint. For many of our competitors, their key challenges and costs include finding suitable and cost-efficient
locations on which to install EV chargers. However, our forecourts provide us access to locations, and we plan to
make continued, efficient investments in this space in order to roll out further electric charging points. The
performance of our trial EV chargers has provided us comfort that the profit margins achievable on the sale of energy
through EV chargers provide a strong business case for a broader roll out. To support this vision, we are working with
other market participants for the deployment of infrastructure and services to support energy transition demand across
our network. See “Business—Our Additional Operations—Electric Vehicle Charging Stations and Alternative Fuels.”

We believe our EV charging stations create a ‘halo effect’ by driving increased customer footfall to their locations.
Our chargers are concentrated at locations that have fulsome Grocery & Merchandise and Foodservice offerings, and
we have found that the presence of electric charging stations helps drive increased customer footfall for such other
offerings as well, since customers will typically spend time at the forecourt while their vehicle is being charged. This
increases the implied profit margin of our electric charging stations, and we believe this provides us with an advantage
over standalone electric charge point providers that do not have the advantage of our large and well-developed
forecourt network. Similarly, we also find that our EV chargers that are on well-developed forecourts benefit from
higher utilization, since customers who visit the forecourt using electric vehicles will often use that time to top-up
their charge. We expect to continue to benefit from this virtuous cycle following the UK Disposal to Asda as we have
agreed to enter into a right to occupation arrangement with Asda that would allow us to continue to use the forecourts
being sold for our existing EV chargers and to have the right to deploy additional EV chargers on any Asda sites
(including standalone forecourt sites and Asda supermarkets) in the future, including but not limited to C-Store sites
sold pursuant to the UK Disposal to Asda. In addition to providing this ‘halo effect’ and higher profit margins than
traditional fuel products, EV chargers also assist with our working capital management by reducing our need for liquid
fuel inventory.

We are conscious that alternative forms of power, other than electric, are being explored as a means to fuel cars, light
vehicles and trucks. Beyond EV chargers, we are also actively considering how compressed natural gas (“CNG”),
liquefied petroleum gas (“LPG”) and hydrogen may form part of a broader strategic program of retail fuels at our sites
to sit alongside traditional transport fuels, with a particular focus on the potential for hydrogen to power light and
heavy-duty vehicles. See “Business—Our Additional Operations—Electric Vehicle Charging Stations and Alternative
_Fuels— Alternative Fuels.”_ In addition, we are also exploring ways to reduce our carbon footprint through our energy
usage. We have already switched to renewable electricity at a number of sites across the UK and Continental Europe,
including all our sites in Luxembourg. Additionally, all of our ‘evpoint’ branded chargers sell electricity only
generated from renewable energy sources. We install solar panels wherever feasible at NTI and KDR sites, including
petrol filling stations and all suitable Foodservice sites, as well as our UK head office. Thus far in 2023, we have
generated more than 1,808,992 kWhs of electricity using solar panels. We also continue to explore battery storage
with the aim of securing self-generated electricity, and in early 2023 we installed our first battery storage unit at our
head office in the United Kingdom. Our EV chargers also generate carbon credits for us which we are currently in the
process of obtaining certification for, following which we may be able to monetize our carbon credits as we grow our
EV charging station network.

**Rationalization of portfolio and focus on strong capital structure**

During 2023, we have undertaken a number of major steps towards deleveraging and addressing our debt maturities.
In May 2023, we completed the sale and leaseback of a portfolio of our US assets, comprising 414 sites across our
Cumberland Farms, Fastrac, Tom Thumb and Sprint brands, with gross proceeds of $1.5 billion (the “U.S. Sale and
Leaseback”) and we announced the UK Disposal to Asda for consideration of £2 billion, which was completed on
October 31, 2023. In addition, we also completed or announced a number of smaller transactions, comprising (i) the
disposal of 26 company operated Minit Mart locations in the Missouri and Kansas resulting in net proceeds of $43
million in April 2023 and (ii) the sale of 55 company operated Minit Mart locations in Kentucky and Northern
Tennessee with net proceeds of $84.4 million. The net proceeds from the UK Disposal to Asda, the Amend and Extend,
the U.S. Sale and Leaseback and the Non-Core Minit Mart Disposal (Missouri and Kansas) are being used to repay
our existing senior secured debt, contributing to a total gross debt reduction of $3,816 million since June 30, 2023.

12


-----

In June 2023, we successfully undertook an amendment and extension process to extend the maturities of $3,169
million of euro, dollar and sterling denominated term loan facilities to 2028 under our Senior Credit Facilities
Agreement (the “Amend and Extend”), which will take effect on the Conditions Satisfaction Date (as defined herein).
See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Senior Credit Facilities Agreement.” As a result of this activity
and our other efforts, we expect to reduce total net leverage from 6.3x for the year ended December 31, 2022 to 5.1x
after the completion of this Offering and giving effect to the use of proceeds contemplated herein. See “Capitalization”
and “Summary Consolidated Historical and As Adjusted Financial Information and Other Data—Other Financial and
_Operating Data.” We remain committed to achieving and maintaining a net leverage multiple in the mid 4x range in_
the near- to medium-term, which we aim to achieve through organic growth in earnings and free cash flow generation
and through working capital initiatives and reduced discretionary growth capital expenditures.

After giving effect to the Transactions, we will have third party debt of $229 million maturing in February 2025, $71
million maturing in March 2026, $671 million maturing in April 2027, $3,662 million maturing in February 2028 and
a further $1,589 million maturing in November 2028.

We believe that our diversified business and robust asset base put us in a strong position to access multiple pools of
liquidity to help reduce the overall quantum of our debt. For example, in order to manage our debt quantum and capital
structure we may consider releasing value from our owned real estate, potential asset sales, and/or third-party minority
equity funding for emerging businesses or concepts such as ‘evpoint’, in addition to relying on a disciplined approach
to capital expenditure, organic growth and free cashflow generation. We believe that we continue to have multiple
potential levers to support our deleveraging objective and we will continue to consider these on a selective basis where
we believe they make financial sense and align with our strategic vision.

**Continued investment in, and review of, our site network**

As an entrepreneurial business, we are always looking to drive growth by investing in our site network and developing
our retail offerings. We aim to continue to capitalize on opportunities to grow, although, especially in the current
environment, we plan to do so through a disciplined approach that is in line with our financial policy.

A key pillar of our organic growth plans is growing our footprint through the building and operation of NTI sites,
which provide us with greater ability to apply our preferred multi-format operating platform offering Grocery &
Merchandise, Foodservice and Fuel (including lower-carbon fuels) products. These NTI sites are typically larger than
our existing sites and often quickly develop into some of our best-performing sites. In line with this strategy, we
opened 31 NTI sites in 2022 (compared to 30 in 2021), out of which 13 were opened in the United States, eight in the
United Kingdom and Ireland (of which seven will be sold pursuant to the UK Disposal to Asda), seven in Australia
and three in continental Europe. In the six months ended June 30, 2023, we have completed the opening of another
seven NTI sites, out of which two opened in the US, one in the Disposed UK Business and four in Continental Europe.
Since June 30, 2023, we have opened another six NTI sites and are currently working on bringing another forty-two
to market. We have continued to grow our land bank to support future new site openings, which we expect will support
our roll-out of additional NTI sites across all of our regions.

In addition, we aim to continue to examine our site network, looking for opportunities to re-invigorate sites through
KDRs and through expansion of our offerings through either extension to existing buildings or through the purchase
of adjacent land and construction of new facilities. Our decision to undertake a KDR depends upon a variety of factors,
including potential traffic flow and customer footfall, the ability to set up or increase our Grocery & Merchandise and
Foodservice offerings, the existence of local competitors and local amenities and the site’s potential profitability.
Although our plan is to focus more on organic growth and become increasingly selective when we consider inorganic
growth opportunities, we aim to continue assessing strategic acquisition opportunities when the appropriate business
proposition presents itself. When we review acquisition targets, we look for a strategically well-located portfolio of
sites and real estate of good quality, generally underpinned by freehold value irrespective of geography.

During 2022, we completed the acquisition of OMV’s high‑quality German forecourt business, consisting of 285 sites
in Southern Germany, for a consideration of €495 million ($541 million). On a smaller scale, we also completed a
KFC acquisition in Germany, which enhanced our growing Foodservice business by providing seven additional sites,
for €27 million ($33 million). For a full list of our acquisitions since 2021, see “Management’s Discussion and
_Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Factors Affecting Comparability of Our Financial_
_Statements—Acquisitions and Disposals.” We believe we can add additional value to such sites by leveraging our_

supply chain network and expertise, expanding brand partnerships in both fuel and non-fuel operations and introducing
our proprietary brands where appropriate, and generating economies by leveraging EG Group’s advantageous
commercial arrangements and negotiating strength.

**The Transactions**

On or around the Issue Date, we intend to enter into committed financing in respect of additional senior term loan
facilities comprising (i) a term facility in a principal amount of €           (the “Tranche E Facility B (EUR)”) and
(ii) a term facility in a principal amount of $           (the “Tranche E Facility B (USD)”, together with Tranche
E Facility B (EUR), the “Tranche E Term Facilities” and each a “Tranche E Term Facility”) provided for under our
existing Senior Credit Facilities Agreement. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Senior Credit
_Facilities Agreement.”_

On or about the Issue Date, we will use the gross proceeds from the Offering and the Tranche E Term Facilities to (i)
redeem the Existing Notes and (ii) pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Offering Transactions. The
Offering, the Tranche E Term Facilities and such use of proceeds therefrom, collectively, are referred to as the
“Offering Transactions”. The Offering Transactions, the UK Disposal to Asda, the Amend and Extend, the U.S. Sale
and Leaseback (as defined herein), the Non-Core Asset Disposals and the application of the proceeds therefrom,
collectively, are referred to as the “Transactions”. The assets beings disposed of pursuant to the UK Disposal to Asda
and the Non-Core Asset Disposals are herein referred to as the “Disposed Businesses”. The UK Disposal to Asda, the
Amend and Extend, the U.S. Sale and Leaseback, the Non-Core Asset Disposals and the application of the proceeds
therefrom (excluding the application of the proceeds from the Non-Core Minit Mart Disposal (Kentucky and
Tennessee)) to repay certain indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facilities and Existing Notes and pay related fees
and expenses, collectively, are referred to as the “Pre-Offering Transactions”.

**_Non-Core Minit Mart Disposal (Missouri and Kansas)_**

In April 2023, we completed the Non-Core Minit Mart Disposal (Missouri and Kansas), consisting of 26 non-core
company operated Minit Mart locations in Missouri and Kansas with net proceeds of $43 million.

14


-----

**_Non-Core Minit Mart Disposal (Kentucky and Tennessee)_**

The Non-Core Minit Mart Disposal (Kentucky and Tennessee) refers to the sale of 65 of our convenience retail
locations in Kentucky and Tennessee, which operate under the Minit Mart and Certified Oil banners. As of November
3, 2023, we had completed the sale of 55 of these sites in a sale to Casey’s General Stores, Inc. for gross consideration
of $101.4 million and net proceeds of $84.4 million. The C-Store site numbers presented in this Offering
Memorandum, when adjusted for the Transactions or the Pre-Offering Transactions, are adjusted for the sale of 63
sites, which include the 55 sites we have sold as of November 3, 2023 and an additional eight sites which are held for
sale and for which we are actively looking for a buyer. We will continue to evaluate our strategic options in relation
to the remaining two sites.

**_The U.S. Sale and Leaseback Transaction_**

On May 16, 2023, we completed the sale and leaseback of a portfolio of 414 sites across Cumberland Farms, Fastrac,
Tom Thumb and Sprint banners in the United States (the “U.S. Sale and Leaseback”). In July 2023, as described below
in “—Recent Developments—Senior Credit Facilities Prepayment and Existing Notes Redemption,” we used a portion
of these proceeds to partially redeem our Existing Notes and repay a portion of our borrowings under our Senior Credit
Facilities. We intend to use the remaining net proceeds from the U.S. Sale and Leaseback, along with the proceeds
from the Non-Core Minit Mart Disposal (Missouri and Kansas) and the UK Disposal to Asda, to repay a portion of
the Tranche A Term Facilities (as defined herein) and Tranche B Term Facilities (as defined herein), as described in
“—Recent Developments—Senior Credit Facilities Amend and Extend” and to redeem a portion of our Existing Notes.
See “Capitalization”.

For a description of the key terms of the U.S. Sale and Leaseback, see “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—The U.S. Sale and Leaseback Transaction”._

**_The UK Disposal to Asda_**

On May 30, 2023, we announced our binding agreement to sell a substantial majority of our Fuel, Foodservice and
Grocery and Merchandise business in the United Kingdom to Asda (the “UK Disposal to Asda”). The headline
consideration was £2 billion. For a description of the key terms of the UK Disposal to Asda, see “The Transactions—
_The UK Disposal to Asda—Sale and Purchase Agreement”._

The UK Disposal to Asda (as defined herein) was a transformational step for us. The proceeds from the UK Disposal
to Asda, along with the proceeds from the U.S. Sale and Leaseback and the Non-Core Minit Mart Disposal (Missouri
and Kansas), will be used to repay certain of our term loan facilities and Existing Notes, as described in “—Recent
_Developments—Senior Credit Facilities Amend and Extend” and to redeem a portion of our Existing Notes. See_
“Capitalization”.

The UK Disposal to Asda, along with the U.S. Sale and Leaseback, is the cornerstone of our strategy to reduce total
net leverage, extend our financing maturities and reposition our capital structure for future business growth and
financial resilience. Following the UK Disposal to Asda, we will continue to operate and maximize long-term growth
opportunities in the United States, Australia, Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Belgium, and
will continue to consider our strategic options in the Retained UK&I Business.

The perimeter and financial metrics of the Disposed UK Business are not identical to our business division in the
United Kingdom and Ireland. As presented in our historical financial accounts and in this Offering Memorandum, our
United Kingdom and Ireland business division’s results of operations and KPIs include the Retained UK&I Business
and do not reflect any deduction for shared service center costs attributable to such operations. However, when
adjusting our consolidated financial KPIs for the Pre-Offering Transactions or the Transactions in this Offering
Memorandum, including for the purposes of calculating Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, we have specifically removed
amounts attributable to the Disposed UK Business, as well as for the Non-Core Asset Disposals, and have given pro
forma effect to the U.S. Sale and Leaseback.

**Recent Developments**

**_Senior Credit Facilities Amend and Extend_**

In the second quarter of 2023, we launched an amend and extend of our Senior Credit Facilities (the “Amend and
Extend”), concurrently with the announcement of a significant deleveraging program.

The Amend and Extend addressed our upcoming senior secured term loan maturities through a partial repayment and
an extension of the maturity date to February 2028. Consenting lenders agreed to (i) extend $3.2 billion of multicurrency senior secured term loans through a combination of the redesignation of existing facilities to new facilities
with the extended maturity upon the satisfaction of certain conditions and new-money commitments (the “Extended
Senior Secured Term Loan Facilities”) and (ii) make certain amendments to the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement,
certain of which took effect once the Consent Letters were countersigned on July 5, 2023, and certain other
amendments which will take effect following the occurrence of the Condition Satisfaction Date (the “Conditional
Amendments”). Following the occurrence of the Condition Satisfaction Date, upon which the extended maturities,
together with certain other amendments, contemplated under the Extended Senior Secured Term Loan Facilities and
the Conditional Amendments will become operative, and following the designated term loan repayments from the
Pre-Offering Transactions, we expect that approximately $300 million in aggregate principal amount of existing term
loans carrying a 2025 and 2026 maturity will remain outstanding following the occurrence of the date on which the
transactions contemplated under the Amend and Extend (as defined herein), including the receipt of the funds by the
Company under the Tranche D Term Facilities, are completed pursuant to their respective terms (such date, the
“Condition Satisfaction Date”). As part of the Amend and Extend, we also secured an extension to the maturity date
of the majority of our existing Revolving Credit Facilities and Letter of Credit Facilities to August 31, 2027. Following
the Condition Satisfaction Date, the total amounts available under the Revolving Credit Facilities and Letter of Credit
Facilities will be $378 million (equivalent) and $638 million (equivalent), respectively. The remaining portion of our
non-extended, existing senior secured term loans will be repaid in full with proceeds from the UK Disposal to Asda,
the U.S. Sale and Leaseback and/or the Non-Core Minit Mart Disposal (Missouri and Kansas). In connection with the
Amend and Extend and the utilization of Tranche D Term Facilities, we will pay certain fees, OID, costs and expenses
totaling $170 million.

The Amend and Extend successfully allocated on June 30, 2023 and the extended maturities, together with certain
other amendments, contemplated under the Extended Senior Secured Term Loan Facilities and the Conditional
Amendments will be become operative upon the occurrence of the Conditions Satisfaction Date following the closing
of the UK Disposal to Asda. If the Conditions Satisfaction Date does not occur by December 31, 2023, none of the
maturity extensions secured in the Amend and Extend nor any of the Conditional Amendments will be implemented
and certain of the redesignation of existing facilities to new facilities to facilitate the extended maturity and newmoney commitments of the Extended Senior Secured Term Loan Facilities will be unwound. For a further description
of the Amend and Extend and our revised Senior Credit Facilities, Revolving Credit Facilities and Letter of Credit
Facilities, see “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Senior Credit Facilities Agreement.”

**_Senior Credit Facilities Prepayment and Existing Notes Redemption_**

In July 2023, we used a portion of the proceeds from the U.S. Sale and Leaseback to partially redeem Existing Notes,
consisting of: (i) the entire outstanding principal amount of the 2024 Murray Euro Notes, (ii) €50,400,000 of the
Existing 2025 Murray Euro Notes, (iii) $56,400,000 of the Existing 2025 Murray Dollar Notes, (iv) $47,800,000 of
the Existing Cirrus Dollar Notes and (v) €52,700,000 of the Existing Cirrus Euro Notes (the “Existing Notes
Redemption”).

We also used a portion of the U.S. Sale and Leaseback proceeds to repay $462 million (equivalent) of senior secured
term loans under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement consisting of:

  - £3,306,135 under the Tranche A Facility B (GBP);

  - €50,367,457 under the Tranche A Facility B (EUR);

  - $13,195,559 under Tranche A Facility B (USD);

16


-----

  - €3,375,742 under Tranche A Apollo Additional Term Facility;

  - $52,188,639 under Tranche A Wildcat Additional Term Facility;

  - A$6,672,360 under Tranche A Murray Additional Term Facility;

  - $8,965,697 under Tranche A Becker Additional Term Facility;

  - £16,626,327 under Tranche A Herbert Additional Term Facility;

  - £3,629,847 under Tranche B Facility B (GBP);

  - €133,363,816 under Tranche B Facility B (EUR);

  - $22,607,725 under Tranche B Facility B (USD);

  - €359,846 under Tranche B Apollo Additional Term Facility;

  - $98,409,068 under Tranche B Wildcat Additional Term Facility; and

  - $29,003,147 under Tranche B Becker Additional Term Facility Loan.

Following the Completion Date, we will use the net proceeds from the UK Disposal to Asda, the Non-Core Minit
Mart Disposal (Missouri and Kansas) and the residual proceeds from the U.S. Sale and Leaseback, to repay:

  - $2,172 million (equivalent) under the Existing Senior Secured Term Loan Facilities;

  - €157 million in aggregate principal amount of the Existing 2025 Murray Euro Notes, plus accrued and unpaid
interest;

  - $162 million in aggregate principal amount of the Existing 2025 Murray Dollar Notes, plus accrued and
unpaid interest;

  - €164 million in aggregate principal amount of the Existing Cirrus Euro Notes, plus accrued and unpaid
interest; and

  - $137 million in aggregate principal amount of the Existing Cirrus Dollar Notes, plus accrued and unpaid
interest.

For more information, see “Capitalization.”

**_Strategic Discussions Regarding the Retained UK&I Business and Leadership Changes_**

Following completion of the UK Disposal to Asda, the Retained UK&I Business will consist of: (i) the electric vehicle
charging business, ‘evpoint; (ii) non-transferring head office staff; (iii) certain brands and intellectual property
(including ‘EG’, ‘Euro Garages’, ‘Vapexchange’ and ‘Hyperform’); (iv) the Cooplands business; (v) the franchise
businesses carried on under the Starbucks brand (the “Starbucks Business”) and the KFC brand (the “KFC Business”);
(vi) the franchise businesses carried on under the Chaiiwala brand and the Cinnabon brand; (vii) the Euro Grocer
business; (viii) 31 operational petrol filling stations and a cluster of Foodservice outlets in the United Kingdom that
were not sold as part of the UK Disposal to Asda; (ix) two additional petrol filing stations in the United Kingdom that
were acquired subsequent to our agreement with Asda relating to the UK Disposal to Asda; and (x) undeveloped land
bank assets.

We are currently engaged in active discussions with Zuber Issa and his advisors regarding the sale to Zuber Issa of
the Retained UK&I Business, excluding the ‘evpoint’ business, the Cooplands business, the Starbucks Business and
the KFC Business, with a view to announcing a binding agreement over the next few months. On 31 October 31, 2023,
our shareholders entered into a letter of intent regarding this potential sale to Zuber Issa of the Retained UK&I

17


-----

Business, excluding the ‘evpoint’ business, the Cooplands business, the Starbucks Business and the KFC Business.
See “Principal Shareholders–Shareholders’ Arrangements.” The sale remains subject to contract and financing and
there can be no assurance that a definitive agreement will ultimately be entered into. Our Board would only enter into
such a transaction on arm’s length commercial terms: while these terms remain subject to negotiation, the parties are
currently considering the valuation multiple underpinning the UK Disposal to Asda as a relevant and comparable
benchmark of enterprise value. If a deal is entered into and completed, we would expect it to close in the first half of
2024 and we would expect to use the net cash proceeds from the sale to further reduce our senior secured indebtedness.
For the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, the Retained UK&I Business (excluding the ‘evpoint’ business, the
Cooplands business, the Starbucks Business and the KFC Business) generated Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16 of
$26.1 million.

Upon the completion of the potential sale to Zuber Issa of the majority of the Retained UK&I Business, Zuber Issa
and Salim Hasan intend to step down as Co-CEO and Chief Operating Officer, respectively, of EG Group, with Zuber
Issa remaining on our Board as non-executive director. Mohsin Issa would then become our sole CEO and would
continue leading our strategy going forward, supported by our strong senior management team responsible for dayto-day operations, including John Carey, President and CEO of EG America, Imraan Patel, Chief Strategy and
Business Officer and Michael Bradley, Chief Financial Officer. John Carey was appointed President and CEO of EG
America with effect from October 1, 2023, with a mandate to drive forward our growth strategy in the United States,
our largest market by both revenue and sites.

**_Strategic Discussions Regarding the KFC Business in the United Kingdom_**

We are in advanced discussions with a third party regarding the sale of the franchise business carried on in the United
Kingdom under the KFC brand, or the “KFC Business”. While the sale remains subject to contract and there can be
no assurance that a definitive agreement will ultimately be entered into, we are negotiating commercial terms with our
counterparty with a view to announcing a deal imminently. If a deal is entered into and completed (with closing likely
to take place in the first half of 2024), we would use the net cash proceeds from the sale to further reduce our senior
secured indebtedness. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, the KFC Business generated revenue of $409
million, gross profit of $211 million and Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16 of $16 million (excluding shared service
cost allocations).

Based on unaudited accounting records and management accounts of EG Group, we estimate that for the quarter ended
September 30, 2023 at actual currency rates, our revenue, decreased by 6%, from $8,060 million for the quarter ended
September 30, 2022, to $7,608 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, our gross profit decreased by 1%,
from $1,195 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2022, to $1,186 million for the quarter ended September 30,
2023 and our Adjusted EBITDA decreased by 21%, from $437 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2022, to
$345 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Excluding the impact of inventory revaluations and the U.S.
Sale and Leaseback rental costs, Adjusted EBITDA decreased by 19%, from $451 million for the quarter ended
September 30, 2022, to $367 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.

Market volatility caused by geopolitical events following the conflict in Ukraine impacted wholesale oil prices and
demand in 2022, causing fuel prices to peak in the summer months. Consequently, during the third quarter of 2022,
the reduction in oil cost prices from the highs seen in the first half of 2022 resulted in strong fuel margins, with the
Group reporting margins of 13.0 cents per liter (excluding the impact of the EG Fuel inventory revaluation). Global
and regional energy markets have since stabilized, with oil prices settling at levels lower than the 2022 average, and
fuel retail prices returning to the levels seen prior to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine with margins in the first half of 2023
averaging 11.4 cents per liter (excluding the impact of the EG Fuel inventory revaluation).

Poor summer weather conditions in the United States and Europe, and an intensifying competitive environment in the
United States and Australia have, however, depressed fuel volumes for the third quarter of 2023, which decreased by
9%, from 4.7 billion liters for the quarter ended September 30, 2022, to 4.3 billion liters for the quarter ended
September 30, 2023. For the third quarter of 2023, global oil prices have started to increase again and the fuel margin
we expect to report in that quarter will be slightly above the average fuel margin reported in the first half of 2023.
Depressed fuel volumes, coupled with the decrease in margins versus the comparative period in the prior year, is
expected to result in a reduction in fuel gross profit and EBITDA in the third quarter of 2023, as compared to the third
quarter of 2022, as summarized in the chart below:

Our Grocery & Merchandise gross profit increased by 3%, from $365 million for the quarter ended September 30,
2022, to $376 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.

Our Foodservice gross profit increased by 24%, from $179 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2022, to $221
million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.

Our Fuel gross profit decreased by 12%, from $594 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2022, to $525 million
for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.

-----

Our other gross margin, including car wash, rental and franchise income increased by 14%, from $56 million for the
quarter ended September 30, 2022, to $64 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. These increases are
largely due to the growth in the business from organic investments.

Based on the trading in October 2023, excluding the impact of the UK Disposal to Asda, the Non-Core Asset Disposals
and the U.S. Sale and Leaseback, we expect our EBITDA for October 2023 to be consistent with that reported for
October 2022.

In addition, during the third quarter of 2023, we have identified a number of initiatives that, if and when successfully
implemented, we believe may improve our overall EBITDA in the near term, which are estimated to generate EBITDA
of $25 million to $45 million. These include (i) a number of initiatives in the United States related to the impact of
further coffee and fountain beverage pricing increases, an employee benefit re-structuring cost initiative, further
growth of Smartpay, which includes a card processing fee cost saving initiative, and additional Tom Thumb to
Cumberland Farms and (ii) potential upside in Australia, where we are also developing synergies from the ongoing
rebranding from initiatives related to third party carwash, the sub-leasing of surplus retail space and we are undertaking
a re-tender of our card processing services which we believe will reduce transactional costs. Although we believe that
we are likely to implement these initiatives successfully, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so, and we
have not included these figures in the calculation of our Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16 because such
initiatives remain subject to further review and finalization. See “Risk Factors––We may not be able to successfully
_implement our growth and consolidation strategies.”_

In the third quarter of 2023, rental expenses have increased by $30 million as compared to the third quarter of 2022.
This increase was primarily as a result of the U.S. Sale and Leaseback, which involved the sale and leaseback of a
portfolio of our U.S. assets, comprising of 414 sites across our Cumberland Farms, Fastrac, Tom Thumb and Sprint
brands, which we completed in May 2023.

**_By Geography_**

_Europe_

On a regional basis, Adjusted EBITDA from our European operations increased by 8%, from $215 million for the
quarter ended September 30, 2022 (Continental Europe: $142 million; United Kingdom and Ireland: $73 million) to
$233 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 (Continental Europe: $160 million; United Kingdom and
Ireland: $74 million). This increase was primarily due to positive inventory revaluations in our wholesale fuel supply
division, EG Fuel, with the group seeing a negative impact of $14 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2022
and a positive impact of $8 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Excluding the impact of inventory
revaluations, Adjusted EBITDA from our European operations decreased by 2%, from $230 million for the quarter
ended September 30, 2022, to $225 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.

_United States_

Against the backdrop of higher than usual margins in the quarter ended September 30, 2022 due to the Ukraine
conflict’s impact on wholesale oil prices and demand, the U.S. business performance was impacted by a challenging
and increasingly competitive environment in addition to poor weather conditions in the quarter ended September 30,
2023. Adjusted EBITDA from our United States operations decreased by 44%, from $217 million for the quarter
ended September 30, 2022, to $122 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was due to the
US sale and leaseback, which led to an increase of approximately $30 million in our rental costs, and fuel performance,
which was negatively impacted by market conditions. Excluding the impact of the sale and leaseback, Adjusted
EBITDA from our United States operations decreased by 30%, from $217 million for the quarter ended September
30, 2022, to $153 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.

-----

The main driver of our underperformance in the United States region was lower fuel margins, which declined by 3.1
cents per liter in the third quarter of 2023 compared to the third quarter of 2022. However, this decline in margin was
exacerbated by the fuel margins in the third quarter of 2022, when fuel margins were among the highest in reported
recent history due to the steep reduction in oil cost prices. While there was a decline when comparing fuel margin of
the third quarter 2023 to the third quarter of 2022, the third quarter of 2023 is in line with fuel margins for the six
months ended June 30, 2023. We continue to see outperformance in fuel margins, relative to pre-COVID levels, driven
by the structural changes in the U.S. market and we have largely seen recovery through October of 2023.

Fuel volumes also decreased in comparison to the third quarter of 2022, falling 9% due to the intensifying competitive
environment and poor weather conditions. However, despite this intensifying competitive environment, we continue
to focus on our premium fuel offering rather than chasing fuel volumes at the expense of margins.

Grocery and Merchandise sales decreased slightly for the quarter, declining by 1%. However, gross profit increased,
driven in part by improved margin from our coffee and dispensed beverage initiatives. Similarly, Foodservice sales
decreased by 1% in the third quarter of 2023, but gross margin increased from 32% to 43%, driven by store
rationalization and the closure of unprofitable concessions. Our overheads decreased in the third quarter of 2023 by
approximately $4 million as we remain focused on managing our labor spending through operational initiatives.

Merchandise margin, Foodservice Revenues and Foodservice margin for the periods indicated below:

_Australia_

Adjusted EBITDA from our Australia operations decreased by 35%, from $38 million for the quarter ended September
30, 2022, to $25 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to lower fuel
volumes and the impact of temporary excise relief, which strengthened fuel margins during the quarter ended
September 30, 2022.

                       - be effectively senior to any existing or future indebtedness or
obligation of the Issuer that is secured on the Collateral on a junior
basis to the Notes, including the Second Lien Credit Facilities, or

satisfy the obligations under the Notes;

                       - be effectively subordinated to any existing and future indebtedness
or obligation of the Issuer that is secured by property or assets that

“Description of the Notes—Notes Guarantees—Notes Guarantees Release”
and “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity
_and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

indebtedness of that Guarantor that is not subordinated in right of

Credit Facilities Agreement, the Existing Notes, the Second Lien

or obligation of such Guarantor that is secured by property or assets
that do not secure its Guarantee, to the extent of the value of the
property and assets securing such indebtedness or obligations; and

                       - be structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness
(including obligations to trade creditors) of the Subsidiaries of such

(together, and with the security interest over all of the issued shares of EG
Italia S.p.A. as per the immediately following paragraph, the “Collateral”).

As soon as reasonably practicable and no later than 10 business days
following the Issue Date, we will submit an application with the Italian
Golden Power Authority pursuant to the Italian Golden Power Legislation in
order for the Italian Law Share Pledge (as defined herein) to be extended as
security for the Notes and Guarantees. On the date that is the later of (a) 90
days of the Conditions Satisfaction Date; and (b) 10 days following receipt
of the Italian Golden Power Clearance (as defined below), the Notes and
Guarantees will be secured by first-ranking security interests (to be granted
or reconfirmed and extended) over all of the issued shares of EG Italia S.p.A.
(the “Italian Law Share Pledge”), subject to the Agreed Security Principles
and the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Collateral also secures the liabilities under the Senior Credit Facilities
and the Existing Notes, and will secure certain hedging obligations (if any)
and certain other future indebtedness permitted to be incurred and secured
on the Collateral, in each case on an equal and ratable basis, and secures the
liabilities under the Second Lien Credit Facilities on a junior basis, in each
case subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. See “Description of
_Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.” References to_
first-priority Security Interests include Security Interests that were created at
different points in time and thus with different chronological priority, but are
contractually treated as being _pari passu with prior-ranking Security_
interests and entitled to equal treatment with other prior-ranking security
secured creditors pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement. The Senior Credit
Facilities and Existing Murray Notes are also secured by security interests

28


-----

over certain assets of EG Holdings (France) SAS and EG Retail (France)
SAS, which do not secure the Second Lien Credit Facilities, the Existing
Cirrus Notes, the Notes or the Guarantees.

The validity, enforceability and, in respect of the security interests over the
Collateral, priority and ranking of the Guarantees and the security interests
and the liability of the Guarantors, are subject to the limitations described in
“Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and
_Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests.” For more_
information on the security interests granted, see “Description of the Notes—
_Security.”_

**Use of Proceeds ...........................................** On or about the Issue Date, we will use the gross proceeds from the Offering
and the Tranche E Term Facilities to (i) redeem the Existing Notes and (ii)
pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Offering Transactions.
See “Use of Proceeds.”

**Optional Redemption .................................** The Issuer may redeem all or part of each series of Notes on or after       ,
2025, at the redemption prices set forth under “Description of the Notes—
_Optional Redemption,” plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional_
Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of redemption.

Prior to        , 2025, the Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem
(a) up to 40% of the original principal amount of the Dollar Notes issued
under the Indenture (including the original principal amount of any
additional Dollar Notes) and/or (b) up to 40% of the original principal
amount of the Euro Notes issued under the Indenture (including the original
principal amount of any additional Euro Notes), using the net proceeds from
certain equity offerings at a redemption price equal to         % (in the
case of the Dollar Notes) and         % (in the case of the Euro Notes) of
the principal amount of the applicable series of Notes so redeemed, plus
accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not
including, the applicable date of redemption; provided that at least 50% of
the original principal amount of such series of Notes (including any
additional Notes of the same series of Notes) issued under the Indenture
(excluding Notes held by the Issuer and its subsidiaries) remains outstanding
after each such redemption.

In addition, prior to        , 2025, the Issuer may redeem all or, from time
to time, part of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal
amount of the Notes plus the applicable “make-whole” premium described
in this Offering Memorandum and accrued and unpaid interest and
Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the applicable date of
redemption.

**Additional Amounts; Tax Redemption .....** All payments made by the Issuer or any Guarantor under or with respect to
the Notes or the Guarantees will be made without withholding or deduction
for taxes or other governmental charges in any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
(as defined in “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes”), except to the
extent required by law. If any such withholding or deduction is required by
law, the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will pay Additional Amounts so that
the net amount you receive is no less than that which you would have
received in the absence of such withholding or deduction, subject to certain
exceptions. See “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes.”

If certain changes in the law of any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction become
effective that would impose withholding taxes or other deductions on the
payments on the Notes, the Issuer may redeem the Notes, in whole, but not
in part, at any time, at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount,

29


-----

plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date
of redemption. See “Description of the Notes—Redemption for Taxation
_Reasons.”_

**Original Issue Discount ...............................** A series of Notes may be issued with original issue discount (“OID”) for
U.S. federal income tax purposes. In that event, U.S. investors generally will
be required to include OID in gross income (as ordinary income) on an
annual basis under a constant yield accrual method, regardless of their
regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a
result, U.S. investors will generally include any OID in income in advance
of the receipt of cash attributable to such income. For more information, see
“Certain Taxation Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax
_Considerations.”_

**Change of Control ......................................** Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control, the
Issuer will be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes at a
purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued
and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of the purchase (subject to
the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest
due on the relevant interest payment date). See “Description of the Notes—
_Change of Control.”_

**Tender Offers .............................................** In connection with certain tender offers for the Notes, if holders of not less
than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the applicable outstanding Notes
validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the
Issuer, or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of the Issuer,
purchases, all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such
noteholders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right to redeem the
Notes that remain outstanding in whole, but not in part, following such
purchase at a price equal to the price offered to each other holder of Notes.
See “Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption.”

**Certain Covenants ......................................** The Indenture will limit, among other things, the ability of the Issuer to:

                       - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain
preferred stock;

                       - pay dividends on, redeem or repurchase our capital stock;

                       - make certain restricted payments;

                       - make certain investments;

                       - create or permit to exist certain liens;

                       - impose restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay
dividends or make other payments to us;

                       - merge or consolidate with other entities, or make certain asset sales;

                       - enter into certain transactions with affiliates; and

                       - impair the security interests for the benefit of the holders of the
Notes.

Each of the covenants in the Indenture will be subject to significant
exceptions and qualifications. See “Description of the Notes—Certain
_Covenants.”_

**SUMMARY CONSOLIDATED HISTORICAL AND AS ADJUSTED FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

**AND OTHER DATA**

_The historical consolidated financial information and other financial data of the Parent as of and for the years ended_
_December 31, 2021 and 2022 have been extracted from the EG Group Audited Financial Statements included elsewhere in this_
_Offering Memorandum or from the Parent’s accounting records. The unaudited condensed consolidated historical financial_
_information and other financial data of the Parent as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2023 have_
_been extracted from the EG Group Unaudited Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum or from_
_the Parent’s accounting records._

_This Offering Memorandum includes unaudited financial information for the 12 months ended June 30, 2023, which is_
_calculated by adding the results of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2023 to the results of operations for the year_
_ended December 31, 2022 and subtracting the results of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2022. The financial_
_information for the 12 months ended June 30, 2023 is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that may be expected_
_for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 or any future period, and should not be used as the basis for or prediction of an_
_annualized calculation. The unaudited financial information for the 12 months ended June 30, 2023 has not been audited or_
_reviewed by our auditors, is not required by or presented in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting_
_principles and has been prepared for illustrative purposes only._

_We further present certain unaudited financial and operating information on an as adjusted basis, to illustrate the effect of the_
_Transactions as if they had occurred on (i) June 30, 2023, for purposes of as adjusted pro forma cash and cash equivalents, as_
_adjusted pro forma first lien net senior secured debt and as adjusted pro forma net debt and (ii) July 1, 2022, for purposes of_
_as adjusted pro forma cash interest expense. We also present certain unaudited financial and operating information on an as_
_adjusted basis, to illustrate the effects of the UK Disposal to Asda, the Non-Core Asset Disposals and the U.S. Sale and_
_Leaseback on the Perimeter Adjusted Information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021, the year ended December_
_31, 2022, the six months ended June 30, 2022, the six months ended June 30, 2023 and the twelve months ended June 30, 2023_
_for certain of our financial and non-financial KPIs. The Perimeter Adjusted Information (i) removes the results of operations_
_and financial information for the Disposed Businesses, including any shared services costs allocated to the Disposed_
_Businesses, from the Group’s results of operations or relevant operating metrics; and (ii) illustrates the effect of the U.S. Sale_
_and Leaseback as if it had occurred on January 1, 2021 for purposes of calculating as adjusted rent expense. We have not_
_purported to adjust our financial information presented in this Offering Memorandum to give effect to the strategic disposals_
_currently under considerations in the United Kingdom, which remain subject to contract and definitive documentation, as_
_described in “Recent Developments.” The unaudited as adjusted information is for informational purposes only and is not_
_intended to represent or to be indicative of the consolidated results of operations or financial position we would have reported_
_had the foregoing events been completed at the beginning of the period presented, nor do they purport to project our results at_
_any future date. The unaudited as adjusted information set forth in this Offering Memorandum is based on available_
_information and certain assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable and may differ materially from the amounts_
_that would have been achieved had the events above actually occurred at the beginning of the period presented._

_Results of operations for prior periods or years are not necessarily indicative of the result to be expected for any future period._
_Prospective investors should bear in mind that the performance indicators and ratios that we report herein, such as the_
_EBITDA-based measures,_ _as adjusted gross margin, adjusted free cash flow, adjusted cash conversion ratio, adjusted cash_
_conversion ratio adjusted for the Pre-Offering Transactions, pro forma adjusted cash conversion ratio, capital expenditure_
_measures and certain other measures are not financial measures defined in accordance with IFRS and, as such, may be_
_calculated by other companies using different methodologies and having different results. Therefore, these performance_
_indicators and ratios are not directly comparable to similar figures and ratios reported by other companies. For the definitions_
_and analytical limitations of these non-IFRS measures, see “Presentation of Financial and Other Information.” You should_
_read the information summarized below in conjunction with the information contained in “Presentation of Financial and Other_
_Information,” “Use of Proceeds,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”_
_and the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum._

_Perimeter Adjusted Information: Cash Flows_

The tables below set out certain of our key cash flow metrics on a historical basis as of and for the years ended December 31,
2021 and 2022 and the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2023 and for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 on a historical
basis and as adjusted basis to give effect to the Pre-Offering Transactions.

_The following financial information also includes discussion of the expected impact of certain cost saving and profit margin_
_synergies, which we have estimated based on certain assumptions regarding the impact of actions that we have taken or intend_
_to take in the future, including in connection with our acquisitions or various initiatives such as rebrands and site conversions._
_This forward-looking information is based on data prepared, as well as assumptions, judgments and estimates made by us, in_
_reliance on information available to us as of the date of this Offering Memorandum. Actual results might differ from such_
_estimates and assumptions. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether_
_as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. See “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors.”_

_Adjusted cash conversion ratio ..........................................................................._ _87%_ _82%_ _77%_ _96%_

(1) Represents the historical results for the Group, which have not been adjusted for the Pre-Offering Transactions.


(2) We define Adjusted EBITDA as profit/(loss) for the period before net finance costs, tax, depreciation of tangible fixed assets, depreciation of right

of use assets, amortization, impairment and profit on disposal, and excluding exceptional items relating to certain non-recurring costs and non-cash
items for the period presented, which are described in more detail below. In addition to the EBITDA from each of our regional businesses,
calculations of Adjusted EBITDA also take into account certain shared service center costs. We believe that EBITDA-based measures are useful to
investors in evaluating our operating performance and our ability to incur and service our indebtedness. EBITDA-based measures are non-IFRS
measures and are not performance indicators recognized under IFRS. Non-IFRS measures are not necessarily comparable to the performance figures
published by other companies. You should exercise caution in comparing these non-IFRS measures as reported by us to non-IFRS measures of
other companies. For more information, see “—Other Financial Information” and “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Presentation
_of Financial Information—Non-IFRS Financial Measures.”_

(3) Net working capital represents the movement in inventory receivables and payables. This figure excludes the impact of any indirect deferred tax

payments.

(4) Capital expenditures represents our purchase of property, plant and equipment and intangibles for the periods presented, which, for budgeting and

tracking purposes, we categorize as maintenance capital expenditure and growth capital expenditure. We define maintenance capital expenditure
as capital expenditure required to maintain the performance of our network.

(1) Represents the estimated fixed rents, changes in net working capital and maintenance capital expenditures attributable to the Disposed UK Business. To
calculate this information, we have made various assumptions about the size of the Disposed UK Business for each line item in relation to the historical
financial information from our United Kingdom and Ireland business before the UK Disposal to Asda. For changes in net working capital, we have
assumed that the Disposed UK Business represents 86% of the $101 million of working capital movements in our United Kingdom and Ireland business
before the UK Disposal to Asda for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023. This 86% has been calculated as the proportion of the total working capital
of our United Kingdom and Ireland business before the UK Disposal to Asda that relates solely to the Disposed UK Business as at August 31, 2023. For
maintenance capital expenditure, we have assumed that the Disposed UK Business represents 76% of the $28 million of maintenance capital expenditures
for our United Kingdom and Ireland business before the UK Disposal to Asda for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023. This 76% has been calculated
as the proportion of the total property, plant and equipment balances of our United Kingdom and Ireland business before the UK Disposal to Asda that
relates solely to the Disposed UK Business as at August 31, 2023. Although we believe these assumptions to be reasonable, if these assumptions turn out
to be incorrect, actual results may differ.

(2) Represents the estimated fixed rents, changes in net working capital, maintenance capital expenditures attributable to the Non-Core Asset Disposals. To
calculate this information, we have made various assumptions about the size of the Non-Core Asset Disposals for each line item in relation to the financial
historical information from our U.S. business before the Non-Core Asset Disposals. For changes in net working capital, we have assumed that the NonCore Asset Disposals represent 2% of the $54 million of working capital movements in our United States business before the Non-Core Asset Disposals
for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023. This 2% has been based on the average Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16 of the Non-Core Asset Disposals
as a proportion of total Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16 for the United States before the Non-Core Asset Disposals for the twelve months ended June
30, 2023. For maintenance capital expenditures, we have assumed that the Non-Core Asset Disposals represent 6% of the $63 million maintenance capital
expenditures for the United States business before the Non-Core Asset Disposals for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 in the United States. This
6% has been calculated as the proportion of total property, plant and equipment in the United States attributable to the Non-Core Asset Disposals as at
June 30, 2023. Although we believe these assumptions to be reasonable, if these assumptions turn out to be incorrect, actual results may differ.

(3) Represents EBITDA impact of $107 million of the U.S. Sale and Leaseback that relates to the pre-IFRS 16 rental charge in relation to the U.S. Sale and
Leaseback, which completed in May 2023. The annual charge on a pre-IFRS 16 basis is $122 million, with $15 million already recognized in the income
statement for the last twelve months ended June 30, 2023.

(4) Includes the results from the Retained UK&I Business. See “Recent Developments” for a description of the other strategic disposals currently under
consideration in relation to the Retained UK&I Business.

(1) We define Adjusted EBITDA as profit/(loss) for the period before net finance costs, tax, depreciation of tangible fixed assets, depreciation of
right of use assets, amortization, impairment and profit on disposal, and excluding exceptional items relating to certain non-recurring costs
and non-cash items for the period presented, which are described in more detail below. In addition to the EBITDA from each of our regional
businesses, Adjusted EBITDA also includes certain shared service center costs. Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16 represents Adjusted
EBITDA excluding the impact of IFRS 16 on Adjusted EBITDA. Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16 represents Adjusted EBITDA
before IFRS 16 adjusted to include (i) the estimated EBITDA from acquisitions, group initiatives and synergies and other EBITDA
annualizations, (ii) run rate adjustment relating to the Non-Core Asset Disposals, (iii) the EBITDA impact of the UK Disposal to Asda and
(iv) annualized rent expenses from the U.S. Sale and Leaseback. We believe that these EBITDA-based measures are useful to investors in
evaluating our operating performance and our ability to incur and service our indebtedness. These EBITDA-based measures are non-IFRS
measures and are not performance indicators recognized under IFRS. Non-IFRS measures are not necessarily comparable to the performance
figures published by other companies. You should exercise caution in comparing these non-IFRS measures as reported by us to non-IFRS
measures of other companies. Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16 as presented herein differs from Consolidated EBITDA as defined
in the Indenture governing the Notes. For more information, see “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Presentation of Financial
_Information—Non-IFRS Financial Measures.” The following table is a reconciliation of profit/(loss) to Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA_
before IFRS 16 and Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16 for the periods presented:

(a) Equals the sum of net income and net finance costs, as reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for the relevant period.

(b) Represents property, plant and equipment impairment, IFRS 16 asset impairment and intangibles (including goodwill) impairment.

(c) For the six months ended June 30, 2023, profit on disposal totaling $328 million relates to the sale of a number of properties in the United States
as part of the U.S. Sale and Leaseback Transaction.

For the year ended December 31, 2022, profit on disposal includes $5 million of exceptional profits, primarily related to (i) $3 million in relation
to the sale of a number of German sites which were disposed of following the outcome of the German Anti-Trust Authorities’ review of the OMV
Acquisition and (ii) $1 million profit on disposal we recognized in November 2022 following the completion of the divestment of GB3 Limited
and its parent company Urban Origin Limited.

For the year ended December 31, 2021, profit on disposal includes $72 million of exceptional profits, primarily related to the sale of a number of
UK sites sold following the outcome of the CMA’s review of the shareholders’ acquisition of Asda.

(d) Operating exceptional items presented reflect those impacting EBITDA, and therefore exclude exceptional finance income and costs, tax on
exceptional items, exceptional impairments and exceptional profit/(loss) on disposal.

For the six months ended June 30, 2023, exceptional costs/(income) primarily relate to the following items: (i) $19 million of transaction and
acquisition related costs in connection with professional fees associated with the U.S. Sale and Leaseback and the UK Disposal to Asda, (ii)
restructuring costs related to redundancy payments that were offered to employees with the aim to reduce staff costs.

For the six months ended June 30, 2022, exceptional costs/(income) primarily relate to the following items: (i) transaction and acquisition related
costs related to professional fees associated with historical acquisitions, (ii) litigation costs related to legal and professional fees regarding federal
court proceedings with Ampol Limited (“Ampol”) and (iii) the revaluation of an unfavorable contract provision of $43 million related to a reduction
in the provisions recognized in relation to the contract entered into with Ampol.

For the year ended December 31, 2022, exceptional costs/(income) represent the following items: (i) transaction and acquisition-related costs of $7
million related to professional fees associated with the OMV Acquisition and also further costs in relation to historical acquisitions; (ii) litigation
costs of $2 million related to legal and professional fees regarding federal court proceedings with Ampol; (iii) the revaluation of an unfavorable
contract provision of $43 million related to a reduction in the provisions recognized in relation to the contract that we entered into with Ampol; and
(iv) restructuring costs of $2 million related to legal and professional fees incurred by us regarding a project to rationalize inter-company debt
balances;

For the year ended December 31, 2021, exceptional costs/(income) represent the following items: (i) acquisition and transaction-related costs within
operating profit of $14 million predominantly related to directly attributable incremental costs incurred as a result of our growth acquisitions, and
largely relate to professional and legal fees, (ii) litigation costs related to legal and professional fees regarding federal court proceedings with
Ampol; (iii) contingent consideration release of $5 million reflecting the release of the contingent consideration relating to the acquisition of
Certified Oil, an acquisition in the United States which completed in 2019, where the criteria for payment were not met and (iv) exceptional
restructuring credit of $2 million related to the release of a provision recognized in 2018 through exceptional items regarding the restructuring of
the management and support teams in Continental Europe.

(e) Represents an adjustment to EBITDA that equals the total impact of estimated lease costs under IAS 17 (Leases) legacy accounting standard.

45


-----

(f) Represents the $107 million impact on EBITDA of the U.S. Sale and Leaseback that relates to the pre-IFRS 16 rental charge in relation to such
transaction, which completed in May 2023. The annual charge on a pre-IFRS 16 basis is $122 million, with $15 million already recognized in the
income statement for the last twelve months ended June 30, 2023. The initial cash rent for the assets included in the U.S. Sale and Leaseback for
the first year is $103 million per annum, rising by 2% annually for the duration of the minimum term of the leases. The annual rent charge represents
the cost of the leases on a straight line basis for the duration of the lease agreement.

(g) Represents the $10 million impact on EBITDA for the last twelve months ended June 30, 2023 of certain assets which we disposed of in connection
with the Non-Core Minit Mart Disposal (Kentucky and Tennessee), which completed between October 10, 2023 and November 3, 2023, partly
offset by $1 million loss at EBITDA in relation to the completed Non-Core Minit Mart Disposal (Missouri and Kansas). See “Management’s
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Factors Affecting Comparability of Our Financial Statements—_
_Acquisitions and Disposals” and “—Recent Developments—Asset Disposals.”_

(h) Represents the Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16 of the Disposed UK Business that will be disposed of in connection with the UK Disposal to
Asda, which is comprised of (i) $197 million of Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16 generated in the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 by our
Disposed UK Business, including shared services central costs attributable to the Disposed UK Business, including the cost of dedicated finance,
HR, legal and IT personnel, as well as other dedicated head office staff, plus (ii) $12 million of annual rental expenses which the Group will pay
Asda in connection with its tenancy of the Starbucks properties. The UK Disposal to Asda was completed on October 31, 2023, See “Summary—
_The Transactions—The UK Disposal to Asda.”_

(i) Annualizations include (i) $12 million related to the full year impact of the expected performance of NTI sites and businesses acquired and or
divested, including (1) our discontinued Australian Foodservice operations, a loss making highway tender in Germany where, after a highway
tender came up for renewal, we disposed of certain poorly performing sites and negotiated new commercial terms on other sites and, as a result, we
have assumed the results for such operations would break even rather than result in a loss for the period and a (2) $4 million loss related to a tender
for highway sites in France which resulted in us not retaining these sites, (ii) capital expenditures annualizations of $24 million in connection with
new sites openings; (iii) rebranding capital expenditures annualizations of $0.5 million related to the annualized EBITDA uplift from our Rewe
conversions in Germany; and (iv) certain other non-recurring items, such as a $48 million adverse inventory revaluation related to our European
Fuel distribution business, EG Fuel. This revaluation related to the stock of raw fuel product stored in EG Fuel’s six terminals and the change in
prices in bio tickets that we hold. We typically determine and reassess the value of the stock of this product based on its weighted average cost,
which closely tracks underlying oil prices and is also impacted by bio ticket market price for biofuel trading certificates. We use biofuel blending
to mix biofuels with traditional fossil fuels and through this process earn certain bio tickets or biofuel trading certificates that can be traded on the
open market. The market price for such biofuel trading certificates is subject to fluctuation Fuel prices have been particularly volatile in the last
few months, which has led to even greater fluctuations in the underlying oil prices and bio ticket market prices than normal. Therefore, we remove
these revaluation figures from pro forma EBITDA, whether positive or negative, as a non-recurring item due to these significant variations. There
was also a non-recurring $12 million lottery adjustment in the United States, where we switched from a paper-based lottery ticket system to a more
advanced technology-based system, which led to an inventory write-down. When annualizing any initiative, we look at sales, costs or expenses
from the last twelve months and build in any expected losses or savings based upon our current assumptions, which we update periodically to reflect
actual trading.

(j) Group initiatives representing a positive contribution to EBITDA of $43 million in the United States and consist of approximately: (i) $2 million
related to the rollout of SmartPay, our payment app which we had primarily used at our Cumberland Farms locations but we have since rolled out
across the region, with the adjustment reflecting the incremental EBITDA expected to result from a combination of reduced credit card fees due to
payments made through the app not being subject to credit card fees, and increased in-store sales due to our tailored marketing to customers via the
app; (ii) $34 million related to a change in our coffee ingredient formulation and our dispensed coffee pricing initiative, which has had a staggered
roll-out since the second quarter of 2023 and has led to a $0.30 increase in the retail price of coffee per cup that has more than offset the underlying
cost increases, with such cost increases reducing our Grocery & Merchandise margins in the United States in the twelve months ended June 30,
2023 (such adjustment reflects the annualized net positive impact of our coffee initiative, including the expected impact of the decrease in sales to
more price-sensitive customers expected to result from such price initiative); (iii) $5 million corresponding to labor hour reductions resulting from
an in-store efficiency review; and (iv) $1 million of other food and operational initiatives undertaken by the Group.

In Europe, Group initiatives in Continental Europe and the Retained UK&I Business representing a positive contribution to EBITDA of $18 million
related to various contract renewals resulting in more favorable terms for us, including (i) $5 million in Benelux in connection with lower logistic
costs for tobacco products and (ii) $6 million in uplifts resulting from the rebranding of our fuel services in France from BP to Esso, which also
resulted in more favorable supply terms for us.

The Group initiatives in Australia representing a positive contribution to EBITDA of $2 million relate to the annualized impact of overhead
initiatives primarily related to headcount savings actioned in early 2023.

(k) Actioned but not recognized synergies are primarily related to capital expenditures annualizations from rebranding, in 2022, certain sites in the
United States from Tom Thumb to Cumberland Farms, a well-established brand, which we expect to result in an EBITDA uplift following this
rebranding. When calculating the annual impact of these synergies, we (a) compared the EBITDA from these sites during the year ended December
31, 2021 during which they were still branded Tom Thumb, to their expected EBITDA under the Cumberland Farms banner during the second half
of 2023 and the first half of 2024 and (b) deducted the EBITDA amount under the Cumberland Farms banner recognized in the twelve months
ended June 30, 2023. Actioned but not recognized synergies also include approximately $500,000 of actioned but not recognized synergies related
to certain Asda food NTI sites and $21,000 related to rebranding capital expenditures.

(l) Unactioned synergies are comprised of (i) $3 million of unactioned synergies related to the uplift expected to result from the strategic rebranding
of the Fuel and Grocery & Merchandise businesses of the Retained UK&I Business to a better-known brand, similar to the uplift experienced with
the Asda ‘On the Move’ rebranding initiative in the Disposed UK Business, and (ii) $9 million related to the expected continuation of the rebranding
from Tom Thumb to Cumberland Farms in Florida.

(m) We have not purported to adjust Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 17 to give effect to the strategic disposals currently under considerations

in the United Kingdom, which remain subject to contract and definitive documentation, as described in “Recent Developments.”

(2) Capital expenditures represents our purchase of property, plant and equipment and intangibles for the periods presented, which, for budgeting and tracking
purposes, we categorize as maintenance capital expenditure and growth capital expenditure. We define maintenance capital expenditure as capital
expenditure required to maintain the performance of our network. We define growth capital expenditure as consisting of (i) Capital Expenditure on

46


-----

Acquired Sites, defined as capital expenditure on the integration of newly acquired sites into our existing brands and formats, including with respect to
rebranding our acquired sites, (ii) Capital Expenditure on New Sites, defined as capital expenditure on new sites, such as new-to-industry sites and new
highway PFS sites, including with respect to rolling out non-fuel offerings at these sites and (iii) Capital Expenditure on Existing Sites, defined as capital
expenditure on existing sites, including the refurbishment of existing sites, including extensions, minor refits of our existing PFS sites, the change in the
operating model of some of our existing sites and the rebranding of our existing sites.

Growth capital expenditures adjusted for the Pre-Offering Transactions represents our growth capital expenditures of $373 million for the twelve months
ended June 30, 2023, adjusted to exclude an estimated $108 million of growth capital expenditure related to the Disposed UK Business and an estimated
$6 million related to the U.S. Sale and Leaseback. To calculate the $108 million of growth capital expenditure related to the UK Disposal to Asda, we
have assumed that the Disposed UK Business represents 76% of the $144 million of growth capital expenditures for our United Kingdom and Ireland
business before the UK Disposal to Asda for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023. This 76% has been calculated as the proportion of the total property,
plant and equipment balances of our United Kingdom and Ireland business before the UK Disposal to Asda that relates solely to the Disposed UK
Business as at August 31, 2023. To calculate the $6 million related to the U.S. Sale and Leaseback, we have assumed that the Non-Core Asset Disposals
represent 6% of the $105 million growth capital expenditures for the United States business before the Non-Core Asset Disposals for the twelve months
ended June 30, 2023 in the United States. This 6% has been calculated as the proportion of total property, plant and equipment in the United States
attributable to the Non-Core Asset Disposals as at June 30, 2023. The foregoing financial information also includes discussion of the expected impact of
certain transactions, which we have estimated based on certain assumptions regarding the impact of actions that we have taken or allocated to the UK
Disposal to Asda or the U.S. Sale and Leaseback. Although we believe these assumptions to be reasonable, if these assumptions turn out to be incorrect,
actual results may differ.

(3) Adjusted cash conversion ratio represents adjusted free cash flow divided by Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16. We define Adjusted free cash flow as

Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16 plus or minus changes in net working capital minus maintenance capital expenditures. We define Pro Forma Adjusted
Free Cash Flow as Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16 adjusted to include the estimated EBITDA from acquisitions, group initiatives and synergies and
other EBITDA annualizations plus or minus changes in net working capital minus maintenance capital expenditures. We define Pro Forma Adjusted
Cash Conversion ratio as Pro Forma Adjusted Free Cash Flow divided by Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16. Adjusted free cash flow, adjusted cash
conversion ratio, Pro Forma Adjusted Free Cash Flow and Pro Forma Adjusted Cash Conversion ratio are non-IFRS measures of liquidity, which we
present because we believe that they are used by, or useful to, certain investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as a measure of our
efficiency at generating cash. However, these non-IFRS measure may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies, has
limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our cash flows as reported under IFRS. For a
reconciliation of adjusted free cash flow to Adjusted EBITDA on a historical basis and as adjusted for the Pre-Offering Transactions, see “—Perimeter
_Adjusted Information: Cash Flows.” The following table sets forth a reconciliation of Pro Forma Adjusted Free Cash Flow and Pro Forma Adjusted Cash_
Conversion ratio to Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16:

(b) See footnotes 1(i), 1(j), 1(k) and 1(l) above for a description of the annualizations, Group initiatives, actioned but not recognized synergies and

unactioned synergies, respectively.

(c) Net working capital represents the movement in inventory receivables and payables. This figure excludes the impact of any indirect deferred tax
payments.

(d) Capital expenditures represents our purchase of property, plant and equipment and intangibles for the periods presented, which, for budgeting and

tracking purposes, we categorize as maintenance capital expenditure and growth capital expenditure. We define maintenance capital expenditure
as capital expenditure required to maintain the performance of our network.

(e) Represents Pro forma Adjusted Free Cash Flow divided by Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16.

(4) As adjusted gross profit represents our gross profit after giving effect to the Pre-Offering Transactions, as further described in “—Perimeter Adjusted
_Information: Fuel Volumes, Revenue, Gross Profit and Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16 by Region and Business Stream.”_

(5) As adjusted pro forma first lien net senior secured debt represents our aggregate as adjusted pro forma indebtedness as of June 30, 2023, that is secured
by a senior ranking lien on the Collateral, less as adjusted pro forma cash and cash equivalents as of the same date. As adjusted pro forma first lien net
senior secured debt reflects the principal amount of first lien indebtedness outstanding including unamortized debt issuance costs, does not reflect accrued
and unpaid interest and does not include real estate financings, which are secured on assets other than the Collateral and are not treated as indebtedness
under the Indenture. As adjusted pro forma first lien net senior secured debt (net of unamortized financing costs) reflects the principal amount of net
indebtedness outstanding net of unamortized debt issuance costs of $170 million. These as adjusted pro forma net debt figures do not reflect accrued and
unpaid interest. See “Capitalization.”

-----

(6) As adjusted pro forma net debt represents our aggregate as adjusted pro forma indebtedness as of June 30, 2023, less as adjusted pro forma cash and cash
equivalents as of the same date. As adjusted pro forma net debt (net of unamortized financing costs) reflects the principal amount of net indebtedness
outstanding net of unamortized debt issuance costs of $175 million, of which $170 million relates to our senior secured debt and $5 million relates to our
second lien debt. These as adjusted pro forma net debt figures do not reflect accrued and unpaid interest. See “Capitalization.”

(7) As adjusted pro forma cash and cash equivalents reflect our cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2023, as adjusted to give effect to the Transactions.
See “Capitalization” and “Use of Proceeds.”

(8) As adjusted pro forma cash interest expense represents the cash interest expense on our as adjusted debt after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions.
As adjusted pro forma cash interest expense excludes amortized debt issuance cost incurred in connection with the Offering. As adjusted pro forma cash
interest expense does not include finance costs related to lease liabilities.

_Key Performance Indicators and Non-Financial Data_

In assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of alternative performance measures and financial measures.
Such indicators are either purely operational in nature, include financial information not derived from our accounting system.
See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information.” The table below sets out certain of our key performance indicators for
the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022 and the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2023. Unless noted otherwise below,
this data is not derived from the EG Group Audited Financial Statements, includes non-IFRS measures and has not been audited.

(2) Represents our total number of C-Stores in the regions in which we operate. After giving effect to the Transactions, we will have 5,937 total sites, 3,719
COCO sites, 1,474 CONCO sites, 744 ‘other’ sites as of June 30, 2023.

(3) After giving effect to the Transactions, we will have 2,766 Grocery & Merchandise stores as of June 30, 2023.

(4) Represents our total number of individual Foodservice outlets or concessions. After giving effect to the Transactions, we will have 1201 Foodservice
outlets as of June 30, 2023.

(5) After giving effect to the Transactions, we will have 31 PFS locations in the United Kingdom and 5,309 total PFS sites as of June 30, 2023. The historical
number for Foodservice outlets in the United States is arrived at using a different definition, pursuant to which certain smaller countertops or cabinets
within Grocery & Merchandise outlets would constitute separate Foodservice sites. Based on this definition, the Foodservice outlets in United States for
the six months ended June 30, 2023 would have been 1,807.

(6) Seven of the NTI sites opened in the year ended December 31, 2022 and one NTI site that was opened in the six months ended June 30, 2023 were
disposed of in connection with the Transactions.

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the Notes involves risks. Before investing in the Notes, you should consider carefully the following risk factors_
_and all information contained in this Offering Memorandum. Additional risks and uncertainties of which we are not aware or_
_that we believe are immaterial may also adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If any of_
_these events occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected, the_
_Issuer may not be able to pay interest or principal on the Notes when due and you could lose all or part of your investment._

_This Offering Memorandum also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results_
_may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including the_
_risks described below and elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum._

_The sequence in which the risks are presented below is not necessarily indicative of their importance, their likelihood of_
_occurrence or the scope of their financial consequences._

**Risks Related to Our Market and Our Business**

**_An economic downturn or a significant deterioration in macroeconomic conditions could have a material adverse effect on_**
**_our operations._**

Our financial performance is dependent on national and regional economic conditions and consumer confidence in Australia,
Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States. Since early 2022,
many of these countries have reported persistent high inflation. Concurrently, central banks in these countries have raised
interest rates in order to fight inflationary pressures and have discussed the possibility of further such rate increases. Such
increases in interest rates may reduce growth and may result in a global or regional recession. The combination of high inflation
and increases in interest rates may also result in a decrease in the disposable income of consumers. Further market volatility
may occur as inflation continues to rise and markets respond to the interest rate increases and the cessation of quantitative
easing programs by major central banks. Our business may be adversely impacted by macroeconomic factors such as a potential
long-term and widespread recession (which may affect disposable incomes, unemployment rates and consumer credit levels),
higher energy costs and fluctuations in commodity prices (including changes in fuel prices), inflationary pressures, and the
availability and cost of credit, which could each affect consumer confidence and, in turn, impact the level of consumer spending
on our products and services. As a result, an adverse change in economic conditions may have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.

If our customers are negatively affected by an economic downturn or a significant deterioration in macroeconomic conditions,
they may spend less on our products and services, and we may generate less revenue. When the economy slows, demand for
freight and trucking is reduced, which may reduce vehicle travel distance and reduce demand for our products and services
from commercial drivers. Likewise, leisure travelers affected by a deterioration in macroeconomic conditions may decide that
they can no longer afford to travel, reducing vehicle travel distance, or that when they do travel, they may spend less at our
sites. Increased unemployment rates during an economic downturn may reduce footfall from commuters and business
customers. For example, during the first half of 2023, we have seen continued reduced footfall caused by a shift to hybrid
working, reducing travel requirement for employees. These impacts on footfall and customer spending have had a
corresponding negative effect on our ability to generate revenue at levels consistent with or higher than at present. Such a
decrease in footfall at our PFS sites in particular adversely impacted our margins and revenue, as Grocery & Merchandise and
Foodservice products offered at our PFS sites are often priced higher than similar products at non-fuel station retail outlets.

Additionally, as commodities and energy are subject to significant price fluctuations and volatility, current high inflation rates
continue to increase pressure on our earnings, as we may not be able to preserve our profit margin during periods of increased
inflation without suffering reduced revenue. Relatedly, increased inflation may lead to increased personnel costs and wage
pressures. We may not always be able to pass such increased costs, in part or in whole, onto our customers, which may reduce
our profit margins. These factors could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
of operations.

In addition, an economic downturn may cause financial stress, performance issues and outright failure by one or more third
parties with whom we enter into agreements, including fuel supply agreements and brand partnership agreements, potentially
resulting in substantial costs to us. For example, fuel suppliers would normally seek to pass increased raw materials costs
through to us, especially if they are experiencing financial stress, and may be able to do so depending on our contractual
relationship with them and our ability to obtain an alternative supply of fuel.


-----

A deterioration in economic conditions could also heighten pressure on the governments in the markets in which we operate.
Governments could take measures to raise additional revenue during an economic downturn, including the imposition of higher
fuel taxes.

Challenging economic conditions could also increase the cost of capital and negatively impact our ability to access the capital
markets and secured lending markets on financial terms acceptable to us. There can be no assurance that our liquidity will not
be inhibited by events affecting the capital markets or that our capital resources will at all times be sufficient to satisfy our
liquidity requirements. Any increase in interest rates will increase the interest we pay on our debt, which will negatively affect
our ability to generate free cash flow. This, in turn, may hinder our ability to repay the Notes.

**_Fluctuations in the price of fuel and non-fuel products may negatively affect our business._**

Any increase in the prices at which we purchase our inventory or our costs in partnering with third parties could adversely
affect the margins on the fuel and non-fuel products and services we sell, and we may not be able to raise our prices due to
economic conditions, competition, regulation, contractual terms or other factors. For example, while we are generally free to
set prices and select stock and promotional offers for our non-fuel products and services at our sites, the terms of our commercial
relationships with our franchise and other partners could require us to set prices no higher than their recommended retail price.
Attempts to pass price increases on to our customers could also negatively affect both short-term and long- term demand for
our products.

Fuel prices have been high in recent years and have fluctuated as a result of various factors, many of which are beyond our
control, such as global and regional supply and demand, geopolitical and economic uncertainty, such as the Russia-Ukraine
conflict, which has threatened supply lines and resulted in embargoes of certain supply sources, and the most recent escalation
of military and diplomatic tensions in the Middle East, as well as pricing and availability of competing alternative fuel
technologies. Changing fuel prices and the inability to project future prices can from time to time impact our business. For
example, changing fuel prices affect the market value of our fuel inventories and expose us to significant fluctuations in the
recorded value of our inventory and the related costs of goods sold, thus reducing our profit margins. In particular, when fuel
cost prices increase, whether as a result of governmental intervention or global oil market conditions, we may not always be
able to pass such increase onto our customers, which may reduce our fuel margins. Fluctuations in cost prices may be
exacerbated in the future, for example, as a result of environmental legislation or regulation. We may face pressure from
consumers and governments to not increase our fuel retail prices and governments in countries where we operate may also
institute fuel price regulation. For example, the program agreement between the Ministers of Economy and Energy and Energia
(formerly the Belgium Petroleum Federation) in Belgium determines the maximum cost for the most common petroleum
products and the way in which these prices can change. As such, there can be no assurance that the price of fuel will remain
stable or that we will be able to pass any price increases onto our consumers, in a timely manner or at all, resulting in higher
expenses, lower margins and other material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Because fuel costs are a significant expense for many of our customers, higher fuel prices may also have an adverse impact on
discretionary spending and travel. For example, for the six months ended June 30, 2023, we saw price sensitive consumers
switching to lower price competitors in the United States. Higher fuel prices have previously caused shipping companies to
consider alternative means for transporting freight, which reduces commercial traffic on motorways and highways and, in turn,
negatively impacts our business. A reduction in road traffic and customer footfall may also negatively impact sales volumes
for our non-fuel products and services.

Higher fuel and non-fuel prices could cause some of our customers to institute cost-saving measures such as seeking out lowerpriced competitors. The publishing of weekly average fuel prices, whether by the government in countries like the United
Kingdom or by private websites in countries like Germany, increase the risk posed by such lower-priced competitors by
increasing the chances of our customers choosing to purchase fuel from them. Lowering our prices to mitigate these risks can
also have a negative impact on our working capital and cash position, as lower prices may not be offset by increased volumes.
Additionally, lower prices could affect our profitability. If prices or fluctuations thereof increase, there could be material
adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Higher fuel prices will also increase the operating costs of our sites. For example, higher fuel prices would increase the costs
of appropriate cold chain requirements for the grocery and foodservice sites. Any increase in fuel prices could lead to a decrease
in margin on grocery and foodservice, negatively impacting our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We are dependent upon our suppliers and partners, their brands and their reputations._**

We offer Fuel, Grocery & Merchandise and Foodservice products and services to our customers largely pursuant to agreements
with a number of franchise and other partners, including prominent fuel brands such as Esso, BP, Shell and Texaco, well known


-----

Grocery & Merchandise brands such as Asda ‘on the Move’, Woolworths, Carrefour, Louis Delhaize and SPAR, and globally
recognized Foodservice brands such as Starbucks, Burger King, Subway and KFC, as well as strong local brands such as
Pomme de Pain, and Greggs. These partnerships and their accompanying brands are a key component of our business, and most
of our revenue is generated from products offered through such partners under their brand names. However, we do not have
direct operational or financial control over our partners and have limited influence with respect to the manner in which they
conduct their businesses. Therefore, we may not be able to influence the development of these brands. In addition, given the
long-term nature of our partnership and franchise agreements, there is a risk that a particular brand may lose popularity during
the term of the relevant agreement and the relevant agreement may contain limited opportunities for early termination and/or
contain stringent non-compete provisions which may limit our ability to implement the best commercial offering at a particular
site.

Our operations depend on the reputations of our partners and their brands and corresponding consumer perceptions. The brands
we offer at our sites could be damaged by claims or perceptions about the quality or safety of our partners’ products or the
quality of our or their suppliers and distributors, regardless of whether such claims or perceptions are true. Similarly, our
partners, and entities in their supply chain, may engage in conduct that damages the reputations of the brands we offer.
Reputational damage to our partners may also occur due to factors beyond their control such as fall out from natural disasters
affecting, or accidents occurring, at their oilfields or oil refineries, contaminated food products, severe allergic reactions to food
products or outbreaks of crop or livestock disease. In addition, our partners may also incur reputational damage by failing to
maintain environmental and social governance standards. Any reputational harm, negative publicity or negative public
perception of our partners or their brands could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results
of operations.

Certain of our partnerships have regular renewal dates, and we may not be able to renew our partnerships on favorable terms,
in a timely manner or at all. See “Business— Descriptions of Our Operations by Region” for more information on partnership
renewal dates. For example, our contract with SPAR in the Netherlands expired in August 2023 but is continuing on the same
terms while a new deal is being negotiated. In particular, the renewal of our contracts can be challenging if our partners insist
on price control mechanisms that could restrict our ability to increase selling prices. We may incur high costs in trying to find
alternative suppliers or partners. The loss of one or more of our franchise and other partnership agreements could have a
significant impact on our ability to attract customers and our operations, and we may be unable to find a suitable replacement,
particularly for fuel supplies.

Our brand agreements generally grant us the right to use the brand principals’ intellectual property in connection with the
development, operation, promotion, marketing and management of their brands. While the brand principals remain primarily
responsible for the protection of the intellectual property associated with their brands, if we or the brand principals fail to
identify unauthorized filings of the brand principals’ trademarks, or either of us fail to adequately protect the brand principals’
trademarks and copyrights, the infringement of the intellectual property rights associated with these brands may cause harm to,
or a diminution in value of, the relevant brand, and possibly a decrease in sales, in turn causing an adverse effect on our
profitability and results of operation.

In addition, historically a significant portion of our Australian fuel sales volumes have resulted from the redemption of fuel
discounts under Woolworths’ shopper docket program. Accordingly, any termination of or failure to renew our long term
agreement with Woolworths could have a material adverse effect on the profitability and results of operations of our Australian
business.

**_A large portion of our products are supplied by a small number of third party suppliers._**

Our operations depend on our ability to obtain fuel products from third-party suppliers, and we are dependent upon the supply
from a relatively limited number of fuel suppliers. For instance, our main fuel suppliers include Esso, BP, Shell, Marathon,
Ampol, Phillips 66, Texaco and Gulf Oil. While we have agreements in place with our fuel suppliers, we do not have direct
control over their operations or the products and services they provide, and our fuel supply stream may be interrupted by
circumstances within our control or outside our control. Further, our transportation and logistics arrangements may not be
adequate to support the size of our future operations. Due to our growing product portfolio, we rely on suitable vehicles to
transport fuel products to our PFS sites, which vehicles may not be available. In addition, transportation might damage our fuel
products, and our fuel products might cause damage to other products, third parties or the environment during transportation.
We also have limited storage facilities and may not be able to store sufficient amount of fuel products that we need to operate
our business, making us more dependent on efficient logistical operations by us and by our third-party suppliers. Any significant
disruption or other adverse event affecting our supplies could have an impact on our ability to receive fuel products or result in
cost inflation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.


-----

To the extent there is any disruption or other adverse event affecting our grocery and merchandise or foodservice supplies, we
can rebrand, and have in the past rebranded, with different suppliers. However, we may still experience disruptions as a result
of these events.

To the extent any of our key fuel suppliers fail to satisfy their delivery obligations (for example, due to transportation or logistics
interruptions, accidents, equipment breakdowns or work stoppages), this could adversely affect our business and we may not
receive full financial compensation for all losses. From time to time, we have experienced limited fuel supplies due to capacity
constraints and other supply-related factors. If we are required to replace any of our key fuel suppliers for any reason, we may
face risks and costs associated with a transfer of operations, and the failure to replace any of our key fuel suppliers on
commercially reasonable terms, or at all, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
of operations. Certain of our agreements with our fuel suppliers, with terms ranging from one to nine years, contain minimum
volume requirements. If we fail to meet the applicable minimum volume requirements, our fuel suppliers may have the right
to terminate the agreement or we may be required to pay an ‘underlifting’ fee to make the supplier whole for the profits it would
have made had we met the minimum volume requirements. These minimum volume requirements, as well as any resulting
termination of any of our agreements or requirement to pay an underlifting fee, could require us to find new fuel suppliers or
could result in additional losses. During the term of our supply agreements, we may also be restricted from sourcing our
products from fuel suppliers who offer the most competitive commercial terms, which could have an adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We may have difficulties competing favorably with other fuel providers and retailers in the locations in which we operate._**

The locations in which we operate are highly competitive. We face significant competition from other existing forecourt
retailers, convenience retailers, food retailers, grocery stores, supermarkets and fast food concessions drawn from local and
large scale multinational corporations, as well as new competitors. The principal competitive factors in the sector in which we
operate include price, quality, brand name recognition, service, location, national and regional presence, accessibility and
product availability. Actions taken by our competitors (including, but not limited to, opening new PFS sites adjacent to our
PFS sites and competing aggressively on price), as well as our failure to respond to such actions, could reduce footfall and
revenue at our sites and place pressure on our profit margins. For example, supermarkets have previously been aggressive in
their pricing discounts and unmanned PFS sites will often offer lower fuel prices to drive higher volumes. Especially in the
United States, several non-traditional retailers, such as supermarkets, club stores and hypermarkets (i.e., retail stores that
combine the features of a supermarket and department store in one location and offer products such as groceries, personal care
products, clothing and consumer electronics), have impacted the convenience retailer industry, particularly in the geographic
areas in which we operate, by entering the motor fuel retail business. These non-traditional motor fuel retailers have captured
a significant share of the retail motor fuel market, and their market share may grow through the use of promotional pricing or
discounts, both at the fuel pump and in the store. We also face competition in respect of our loyalty programs as existing fuel
card issuers (including major fuel producers and/or refiners) and new players in the market (including car manufacturers and
leasing companies) may offer customers better benefits, whether actual or perceived, which may direct customers to visit
competitors’ sites instead of ours. Moreover, action taken by regulatory authorities could increase competition and facilitate
the access of new players into the market. New players in the market, such as companies specializing in electric vehicle charging
points, may have offerings that include additional services which compete with our offerings. New players may also include
major fuel producers or refiners that may be able to more effectively compete on price, and may make it more difficult for us
to secure advantageous terms from suppliers. If major fuel producers or refiners become more aggressive in expanding their
operations to compete with our offering portfolio, we may also face increased competition for limited acquisition opportunities.
Some of our current and potential future competitors, including major fuel producer and/or refiners, may be larger and better
capitalized than we are and, as a result, may be better positioned to take advantage of strategic acquisition and consolidation
opportunities that can rapidly increase market share. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, and results of operations.

Our future performance is dependent upon our continuing ability to meet customer needs and provide a differentiated and
relevant offering, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to compete favorably in these competitive markets
or that increased competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business by reducing our ability to maintain sales
and profit margins. Our competitors may be able to secure better terms from suppliers, provide cheaper products and services
and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfilment, and marketing, including through larger scale benefits.
These competitive pressures could cause us to lose market share and may require us to lower prices, increase capital, marketing
and advertising expenditures or increase the use of promotional campaigns which could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.


-----

**_We depend on good working relationships with dealers, retailers, governmental agencies and third party contractors._**

We depend on third parties for the provision of certain labor, equipment and services. The third parties with which we work
include product storage service providers, contractors, transporters, dealers and retailers. As a result, our operations are subject
to a number of risks, some of which are outside of our control, including liability as a result of the actions of third parties with
which we work. In particular, with respect to dealers and retailers who operate our CONCO and ‘other’ sites, we may face
liability for accidents or incidents at these sites resulting from those dealers’ or retailers’ actions. Any failure by such dealers
or retailers to maintain high quality standards could give rise to reputational damage, and to legal or regulatory actions being
brought against us.

In cases where we are not the operator of the sites in our network, including sites under the CONCO and ‘other’ operating
models, we depend on the formation and maintenance of relationships with dealers and retailers. Although we endeavor to
maintain a good working relationship with these dealers and retailers, there can be no assurance that the dealers and retailers
with which we currently work, or in the future will work, will choose to conduct business with us on an ongoing basis or that
they will comply with the terms of an agreement with us. We continue to rely on dealers, retailers and third party contractors
as we expand and open more sites, both organically and through strategic acquisitions. Accordingly, if dealers, retailers or third
party contractors decide to give preference to our competitors or cease to do business with us, it could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, with respect to transport services, the vessels, tank trucks and trucking services for our product transportation are
chartered mainly under contracts from third parties. Any deterioration in or other changes relating to our relationships with
such third parties, including changes in supply and distribution chains, could result in delayed or lost deliveries or damaged
products. Third parties may decide to increase their prices for transport services provided to us or discontinue their relationships
with us. There is no assurance that we will be able to negotiate or maintain terms commercially acceptable to us, or locate
replacement service providers on a timely basis. Delivery disruptions may also occur for reasons out of our control, such as
poor handling, labor strikes and adverse climate conditions. The occurrence of one or more of these risks could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

We may also face difficulties competing in the highway concession market. Highway concession operations, which are among
our most profitable operations, depend on authorizations from governmental regulatory agencies in the countries in which we
operate, which are subject to bid, expiration, limitation on renewal and various other risks and uncertainties. Since our
competitors also value highway concessions, we cannot guarantee that we will obtain or be able to renew highway concessions
on favorable terms or at all. In addition, highway concession operations may be subject to stringent conditions, such as those
limiting the products and services provided and hours of operation, with which our competitors may be better able to comply
without adversely affecting their results of operations. In addition, the operation of highway locations can come with extensive
costs and we may be required to pay more than we have paid historically in order to renew our existing highway concessions,
adversely affecting our cash position relative to our competitors. Our inability to obtain highway concessions, to negotiate their
renewal on favorable terms or at all, or to operate them profitably could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

**_Maintaining favorable brand recognition of our proprietary brands is important to our success, and failure to do so could_**
**_have a material adverse effect on our business._**

Our proprietary brand names enjoy a high degree of familiarity and awareness in the markets in which we operate, and we
believe maintaining these brands is a key component of maintaining our position in our industry. Factors affecting brand
recognition are often outside of our control, and efforts to maintain or strengthen these brands may not always have the desired
effect. Events such as lawsuits, product recalls, outbreaks of food-borne illness, supply chain interruptions, crimes committed
at our locations, employee misconduct (actual or alleged), personal data breaches and allegations (true or otherwise) regarding
the treatment of our employees could result in negative publicity and damage to our brands and reputation. In addition,
damaging statements (whether true or otherwise) about us, our locations and our products can be widely disseminated through
online platforms, and we may have limited or no ability to respond to these statements or take action to have them taken offline.
If damage to one or more of our brands were to occur for any of these or other reasons, there can be no assurance that we would
have the resources available to adequately invest in marketing, public relations or advertising campaigns to repair these brands,
that any such campaigns would be effective or that we would be willing or able to take any other actions to limit or reverse this
damage.

If our customers have a less favorable view of us, our locations or our products, they may seek alternative products or providers,
and this could directly impact our results of operations. In addition, damage to our brands or our reputation could make us less
attractive partners for the national and regional brands we offer through our locations, which could result in the loss of some


-----

of these commercial relationships. If either of these outcomes resulted from our failure to maintain our brands or damage to
one of our brands, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Any event that damages or renders inoperative Cumberland Farms’ warehouse and distribution facility in Westborough,_**
**_Massachusetts could have a material adverse effect on our ability to supply products in the United States._**

We own and operate a 560,000 square foot warehouse and distribution facility in Westborough, Massachusetts, from where we
supply a significant portion of the merchandise sold in our Cumberland Farms C-Stores in the United States. Any event that
damages this warehouse or renders it inoperative, such as power outages or severe weather, could have a material adverse effect
on our ability to supply products to our Cumberland Farms stores and other stores in the United States, which in turn could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, we also perform our own cigarette tax “stamping” for Cumberland Farms stores exclusively in this warehouse and
distribution facility in Westborough, Massachusetts. If any damage were to occur to our cigarette tax “stamping” machines at
this facility, we would have to outsource the cigarette tax “stamping” to a third party, which could result in additional costs.

**_We may not be able to successfully implement our growth and consolidation strategies._**

Our growth strategy is based on a mix of organic growth and selective acquisitions. Failure to identify, acquire and develop
new sites or upgrade existing sites, convert sites to our preferred COCO model or to meet capital expenditure requirements for
development or refurbishment are some of the risks to which we are subject. In addition, we may be required to divest certain
assets in connection with an acquisition if required to do so by any anti-trust or competition authority such as the Competition
& Markets Authority (“CMA”) (UK), the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) or the German Bundeskartellamt (the
“German Anti-Trust Authorities”). For example, we were required to divest a number of petrol filling stations by the end of
2021 following the CMA’s review of our shareholders’ acquisition of Asda and a further 48 sites in 2022 in Germany following
German Anti-Trust Authorities’ review of the OMV Acquisition. Furthermore, developments in policy, law, regulation,
technology, markets and societal and investor sentiment related to the issue of climate change and increased preferences for
alternatives to fossil fuels, including hybrid and electric vehicles, may have a negative impact on our growth strategy.

Our growth strategies include optimizing and expanding our operations, achieving cost reductions and efficiencies and pursuing
our other growth strategies that involve inherent costs and uncertainties. For example, a key part of our growth strategy for
Continental Europe is to review and identify dealer-operated sites which we can convert to our preferred COCO model. While
we typically incur little to no costs in connection with COCO conversions, we may need to pay early termination fees if we
decide to convert CONCO sites to COCO sites before our contracts with the relevant dealers, franchisees, and retailers expire.
Our growth strategies also include extracting synergies from past acquisitions and undertaking strategic acquisitions that
involve projections of uncertain returns. There is no assurance that we will achieve our objectives or other anticipated benefits.

In addition, disposals completed as part of our consolidation strategy could result in lower revenue, impairments of goodwill
and a lower amount of total assets on our balance sheet. We may encounter unanticipated events, costs or delays and retain or
incur contract or legal liabilities related to the disposed business with respect to employees, customers, suppliers, partners or
other third parties. Disposals may also negatively affect the diversification of our offering portfolio and our ability to meet our
customers’ demands. Disposals may also lead to delayed implementation of strategic initiatives of the retained business. Any
of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our future prospects, business, financial position and results of
operations.

**_We may not be able to successfully integrate the businesses we have recently acquired or will in the future acquire into our_**
**_business._**

We may not be able to successfully integrate our recent acquisitions (including the OMV Acquisition, the Cooplands
Acquisition and the Sprint Acquisition, among others) or any other business we will acquire in the future into our operations
without encountering difficulties. These difficulties may include, among other things, the integration of certain operating and
IT systems, including point of sale systems and inventory processing systems, the loss of customers or key employees, diversion
of management’s attention, the disruption of our respective ongoing businesses or possible inconsistencies in standards,
procedures and policies. Furthermore, certain contracts may have terms and conditions that are weaker than our standard
contracts, and we may not be able to integrate or update them as quickly as we would like or without incurring significant fees.
In addition, we may not have, or be able to retain or hire, employees with the appropriate skill sets for the tasks associated with
our integration plans, particularly in the expected time frame in which we require them, and could experience employee
departures and early retirement due to relevant business changes, all of which could adversely affect the success of the
integration plans. In particular, the loss of key managers or other experienced and knowledgeable local employees, may result
in the loss of knowledge and continuity for the relevant business. For example, in Europe we have in the past experienced


-----

problems with the administration of certain arrangements with our suppliers following the departure of the managers
responsible for them. The integration process for our acquisitions, if implemented ineffectively, would restrict the realization
of the full expected benefits, including cost savings and profit margin synergies. Failure to meet the challenges involved in
integrating any businesses we acquire into our existing business and to realize the anticipated benefits therefrom could cause
an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, our activities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operation.

In order to fully integrate the financial accounting systems of our acquired businesses, we have previously had to, and continue
to need to, update and enhance our internal accounting systems and processes and our internal controls over financial reporting
and we continue to experience variance in the quality and timeliness of information and evidence prepared for our annual audits
across different geographies and divisions, particularly in our more recent acquisitions, such as the OMV Acquisition. This has
required, and will continue to require, additional capital investments by us, and may require incremental resources and system
configurations that could increase our operating costs in future periods, as we continue in our ongoing efforts to adjust our
control environment to the standards of a business of our size and scale. The integration processes and continuing work on our
control environment require significant time and attention from our management team, resulting in costs linked to the diversion
of the attention from our management team from day-to-day operations of our business. Failure to identify and remediate
deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting in a timely manner could prevent us from accurately and timely
reporting our financial results and lead to a loss of investor confidence. These difficulties and expenses could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

**_We may not be able to support our growth with adequate corporate functions and other resources._**

Notwithstanding the UK Disposal to Asda and the other strategic disposals in the UK currently under consideration, we have
grown significantly, primarily through several acquisitions but also organically, in recent years. Our operations have become
more complex and more global, cover ten countries in three continents and require adequate support from our central corporate
functions. Although our corporate function has also grown in this time, the size and configuration of our financial and IT teams,
at both the group and local levels, are still not necessarily proportionate to the scale and complexity of our operations.
Accordingly, we are required to continue to invest in and strengthen our corporate support functions by providing adequate
additional human and other resources that are proportionate to and can effectively support our operations and their expected
growth.

In order to implement and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting that are commensurate to the current and
future scale of our operations we need to, among other things.

  - Continue to expand our financial reporting team by hiring and retaining, at both Group and local level, an adequate
number of personnel with a suitable skill set. However, we may be unable to attract and retain suitable candidates as
we face significant competition for talent due to several factors, including location preferences and salary expectations.
In addition, based on our experience when we acquire and integrate a new business, we may not always be able or
want to retain local personnel responsible for financial reporting at the acquired business and their exit from the
acquired business might also result in the loss of their institutional knowledge of financial reporting matters relating
to such business.

  - Integrate and develop our IT systems relating to our accounting records and processes across the Group’s operations,
especially in our newly acquired businesses. However, due in part to the large number of acquisitions we have made,
we currently still operate a number of different IT systems based on different operating software. Even when the main
software application is the same, it might be at different stages of development for each of our country operations,
which may make it more difficult for these systems to operate effectively and on an integrated basis. We may be
unable to successfully integrate our IT systems, whether in a timely fashion or at all, and we may therefore be required
to operate different IT systems for our different country operations for longer than expected. In addition, our failure
to adequately enhance our overall IT systems, for example due to delays or other difficulties in rolling out a new
software program across the Group, functionality may further delay the implementation of group-wide policies and
financial controls.

  - Adopt and implement Group-wide financial reporting systems as well as standard policies and procedures, including
internal financial reporting manuals and procedures as well as protocols for senior oversight and the preparation of
management accounts at local and Group level. However, we have experienced delays and may be unable to
implement these common policies and procedures, whether in a timely fashion or at all, especially in connection with
the integration of our newly acquired businesses.


-----

Whilst we have established a business and controls improvement team to develop, mature and monitor the control environment,
we do not yet have an internal audit function to independently monitor risk controls within the business, but this is will be put
in place during 2024. Our current lack of an internal control function may result in the occurrence of undetected business errors
or abuse that may have otherwise been prevented. More generally, if we fail to adopt, implement or maintain an effective
internal audit function that is in line with what applicable laws and regulations, market practice or investors’ expectations may
from time to time require for a company of our size and complexity, we may lose the confidence of financial markets and our
investors, and we might be exposed to liability.

Our failure to implement one or more of these initiatives could adversely affect the effectiveness, reliability and integrity of,
and eventually result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in, our internal controls over financial reporting or risk
management. For example, there might be a lack of coordination, supervision and consistency between local operations and
management, on the one hand, and our centralized shared service centers, on the other hand. Certain key processes and controls
may not be properly documented, understood or implemented, financial information at country level may not be adequately
reported at Group level, the increasing volume and complexity of information may not be properly reviewed and challenged or
issues may go unnoticed. This might also result in issues adversely affecting the quality and timeliness of information and
evidence prepared for each year-end audit process, which might in turn lead to accounting inaccuracies or misstatements in our
financial reporting. The implementation of these initiatives, systems, processes, policies and procedures may also require us to
incur significant costs and involve significant time and attention from our management.

**_Our acquisitions, divestitures or group initiatives may not be successful and we may not achieve the returns, synergies, cost_**
**_savings or other benefits initially anticipated from them._**

We have a history of making acquisitions and in the future we may acquire companies or assets engaged in similar or
complementary businesses to our own if we identify appropriate acquisition targets, and may dispose of certain of our assets
and businesses if presented with a suitable market opportunity. In addition, we undertake a number of initiatives, such as KDRs,
COCO conversion, special promotions and rebrands, to use our network and various brands to achieve cost savings and to
increase the profitability of our sites. However, there can be no assurance that any of these measures will have the desired
positive impact.

The acquisitions we have made in the past or that we may pursue in the future involve a number of risks and challenges that
may have a material adverse effect on our business. We have incurred and could incur significant one-time costs, including
banking, legal, accounting, finder’s or other fees and expenses, as well as liabilities that are not covered by the representations
and warranties in the sale and purchase or equivalent agreements and are not otherwise recoverable from the sellers. The
acquisition and integration of acquired businesses may not be successful, may be time-consuming and costlier than anticipated
and may divert our management’s attention from the running of our business. Any acquisition we have made or may make in
the future may not be as profitable as we anticipated and we could be required to write-off some or all of the acquired assets.
Furthermore, unidentified issues may emerge that were not discovered in our due diligence process, including legal
contingencies.

In addition to acquisitions, we undertake a number of group initiatives aimed at realizing synergies, operational efficiencies or
cost savings. These include rebrands aimed at using our most recognized and highest value brands, as well as KDRs and COCO
conversions to improve site profitability. There can be no assurance that our acquisitions or any of these initiatives will be as
successful or accretive as initially expected or meet our strategic goals. For example, we may fail to realize expected operational
efficiencies or cost savings. There is also a risk that the synergies that we seek to achieve may not be realized within the time
frame we currently anticipate, or at all, and that the magnitude of cost savings or operational efficiencies may be less than
expected or the costs of achieving these synergies may be higher than expected. Our anticipated synergies are based on a
number of assumptions, which are subject to uncertainties and contingencies that are outside of our control.

In addition, restrictions under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, the Notes, the Existing Notes or any other current or
future debt instrument may limit or preclude our ability to make or finance acquisitions. Further, we may use debt financing
for any permitted acquisitions, which would increase our debt service requirements.

We have also made and continue to make disposals of some of our businesses, but we may fail to achieve the cost savings or
other benefits anticipated. In addition, we may be subject to contingent liabilities or other legacy issues in relation to our
disposals. We could be subject to reputational risk if the operations of a new owner of a business we dispose of were not up to
our established standard and such business continued to be associated with our business. Furthermore, larger divestitures, such
as the UK Disposal to Asda and the other strategic disposals in the UK currently under consideration, may result in operational
difficulties for our remaining business. Our failure to complete acquisitions and disposals, successfully integrate acquired


-----

businesses or successfully execute group initiatives may materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, results of
operations and financial condition.

In addition, if we decide to sell assets or a business, we may have difficulty obtaining terms acceptable to us in a timely manner,
or at all. Additionally, we may experience difficulty separating out portions of, or entire, businesses, incur loss of revenue or
experience negative impact on margins, or we may not achieve the desired strategic and financial benefits. Such potential
transactions may also delay achievement of our strategic objectives, cause us to incur additional expenses, disrupt customer or
employee relationships, and expose us to unanticipated or ongoing obligations and liabilities, including as a result of our
indemnification obligations under the relevant sale agreements. Further, during the pendency of a divestiture, we may be subject
to risks such as a decline in the business to be divested, loss of employees, users, or suppliers and the risk that the transaction
may not close, any of which would have a material adverse effect on the business to be divested and our retained business. If a
divestiture is not completed for any reason, we may not be able to find another buyer on the same terms, and we may have
incurred significant costs without the corresponding benefit.

**_The divestiture of the substantially all of our business in the United Kingdom presents risks and challenges that could_**
**_negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations._**

In May 2023, we announced that we had agreed the sale of the majority of our fuel, foodservice and grocery and merchandise
business in the United Kingdom. The transaction contemplated under the Sale and Purchase Agreement was completed on
October 31, 2023. See _“The Transactions—The UK Disposal to Asda.” We are also in advanced separate discussions with_
Zuber Issa and a third party regarding the sale of the Retained UK&I Business (other than the ‘evpoint’ business, the Cooplands
business and the Starbucks Business ), although both deals remain subject to contract. The UK Disposal to Asda and the other
strategic disposals currently under consideration in the UK present ongoing risks and challenges that could negatively impact
our business, financial condition and the results of operations. See “Recent Developments.” Any difficulties that we face arising
out of the UK Disposal to Asda and the other strategic disposals currently under consideration in the United Kingdom or the
ancillary agreements reached with Asda or to be entered into with Zuber Issa in relation to the relevant businesses may result
in management’s attention being diverted from our continuing business operations. The occurrence of any of the foregoing
could result in significant harm to our business and financial conditions and our results of operations could be materially
adversely affected as a result. We cannot be certain that we will be successful in managing these or any other significant risks
that we encounter as a result of the UK Disposal to Asda.

**_We face various political, economic, legal, regulatory and other risks and uncertainties associated with conducting business_**
**_in multiple countries._**

Our business and results of operations are subject to various risks inherent in international operations over which we have little
or no control. These risks include, among others:

  - transportation delays and difficulties of managing international distribution channels and suppliers;

  - different and/or longer payment cycles for and greater difficulty collecting client accounts receivables;

  - the inability to inject capital in our foreign subsidiaries or to otherwise finance our foreign operations;

  - fluctuations in currency exchange, currency controls and repatriation issues;

  - economic downturns in countries or geographic regions where our suppliers or partners are located which among other
things may expose the operations of our suppliers or partners to risks, leading to an increase in our manufacturing
costs or delayed delivery;

  - changes in foreign policy or regulatory requirements, trade restrictions, higher tariffs and changes to existing, or the
imposition of additional, regulations relating to import or export of our products;

  - our ability to comply with a wide variety of legal and tax regimes, including those relating to environmental laws and
regulations or liability and warranty requirements in relation to our products and services;

  - unfavorable changes in tax or other laws, including the imposition of new laws or regulations that restrict our
operations or increase our cost of operations;

  - work stoppages and sudden or unexpected increases in wages;


-----

  - Brexit and exit from international treaties;

  - social unrest, as evidenced, for example, by protests in France, and any resulting supply chain or business
interruptions;

  - political instability, including wars or other armed conflict (such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine or the recent
escalation of military and diplomatic tensions in the Middle East), terrorism, political unrest, boycotts, curtailment of
trade and other business restrictions, and any resulting supply chain or business interruptions; and

  - difficulties in obtaining the protections of the intellectual property laws of other countries.

The likelihood of such occurrences varies from country to country but remains largely unpredictable. However, the effects of
any of these occurrences, or any combination thereof, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
and results of operations.

Further, should we choose to expand into new geographical markets, we may be subject to several risks in addition to the ones
we are already subject to. For example, we may be unable to reach agreements with prospective suppliers or partners to operate
in the new market, or adapt our business model to local consumer preferences or a customer base with different expectations
for amenities, especially in respect of our Grocery & Merchandise or Foodservice offerings. We may also have difficulty hiring
experts or qualified executives or employees in new territories. In addition, expansion requires significant start-up costs, and
places a strain on our management systems, infrastructure and resources and may continue to do so on an ongoing basis. As a
consequence, we may be unable to successfully integrate the services, products and personnel of any new sites we open or
acquire into our operations, which may ultimately translate into a lack of return on our investment. We cannot guarantee that
any potential future efforts at expansion will be successful and we could expand in markets that may not prove to be attractive
in the future, which may subsequently have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

**_We may not be able to adapt to new developments or technological changes in the industry in a timely manner or at all._**

We may be unable to adapt to fast-paced developments regarding climate change and the impact of petroleum- based fuel on
the environment, which may alter consumer sentiments and lead to increased regulatory measures being taken towards our
existing fuel products, or to new technologies resulting in improved fuel efficiency and the increased use of alternative fuels.
The automobile industry has focused heavily on reduced fuel consumption, a trend that will likely continue with improvements
to alternative fuels such as electricity, hydrogen or compressed natural gas. While we have begun implementation of EV
chargers, including our ultra-fast ‘evpoint’ chargers, we may be unable to sufficiently or timely adapt to the evolving views on
petroleum-based fuel. If implementation of our EV chargers, including our ‘evpoint’ chargers is unsuccessful, demand for EV
chargers decreases, or we are unable to further adapt to ongoing environmental concerns, whether they be new regulatory
requirements or consumer sentiment, our retail fuel sales may be negatively impacted. Furthermore, due to consumer sentiments
with regards to our existing fuel products, we are subject to reputational risks that we may not be able to avoid. We cannot
guarantee that we will be able to adapt to environmental concerns or that any future attempts to align with these concerns will
be successful, which may subsequently have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations. See “—We may not be able to build and scale our charging stations as expected and the market for EV charging
_stations may not develop in the manner in which we expect.”_

The introduction of large numbers of driverless cars and driverless technology in the markets in which we operate could reduce
stopping frequency at our forecourts and could change the requirements for commercial vehicles to stop as frequently, which
may not be offset by the increased time customers would be at our sites to adequately charge an electric car for onward travel.
Customers of electric vehicles, for example, may also prefer to charge their vehicles at home or other locations, reducing
footfall at our sites. These trends may have a material adverse effect on both our fuel and non-fuel sales volumes and revenues.
Driverless vehicles or alternative vehicle fuels also require new distribution channels and equipment. We may be unable to
keep up with these needs, for example, because our infrastructure and business model may be incompatible with supplying
them, because we may be unable to negotiate favorable supply terms or because the sale and distribution of these products may
not be sufficiently profitable to our business to justify their costs. In addition, we enter into long-term contracts with our fuel
suppliers and we may need to comply with minimum quantity requirements under these agreements even if demand for
traditional fuels decrease, or we may otherwise be subject to penalties or termination provisions.

Customers who are using alternative transportation methods to reduce fuel consumption and emissions, such as bicycles, trains,
subways or trams, are less likely to stop at our locations. Circumstances, such as increased traffic congestion, that make
alternative transportation methods more attractive could result in decreased turnover and have a material adverse effect on our


-----

business, financial condition and results of operations. Our service areas have also been, and will continue to be, affected by
changes to the road and motorway networks in the areas we serve. The development of new roads and motorways, the addition
or increase of tolls and prolonged road repairs, construction or alterations may result in changes to traffic patterns that
negatively impact our business. These changes could include reduced vehicle traffic near our service areas, lower turning rates
and temporary or permanent site closures. Any such change could result in reduced footfall and turnover at the affected
locations. Generally, we may be unable to correctly predict or implement the appropriate strategies for adapting to such changes,
developments or technological changes in the markets in which we operate, which could result in reductions to our market
share, footfall and revenue and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We may not be able to build and scale our charging stations as expected and the market for EV charging stations may not_**
**_develop in the manner in which we expect._**

We have invested in the provision of facilities for electric vehicles and developing a strategy to significantly increase such
facilities in the coming years as the number of electric vehicles on the road continue to increase. The success of this strategy
depends on our ability to build and scale our network of EV charging stations at a pace that aligns with customer demand, as
well as introduce product offerings to address the changing needs of the EV charging market and in the face of increased
competition. We cannot guarantee that our charging stations will be set-up in a timely manner or at all. As EV technologies
change or governmental regulations impose new requirements on EV charging technology, we may need to upgrade or adapt
our charging station technology and energy storage solutions and introduce new products and services in order to serve vehicles
that have the latest technology, which could involve substantial costs. We face a number of costs in relation to building out and
scaling our network of charging stations, which include upfront capital expenditure as well as the cost and viability of
connecting charging stations to the grid. We may also incur additional costs and expenses related to new product transitions
such as adverse impacts due to supply chain failures to procure sufficient new product components, purchase price variances,
or costs related to new product transitions, including as the result of any failure on our part to meet our own estimates and
projections. Our rollout of charging stations may be delayed by manufacturing, production and/or shipping delays, which could
result in increased costs and the delay in or failure to meet our installation goals or commitments. Furthermore, our EV charging
stations may have undetected defects, errors or bugs in hardware or software which may reduce market adoption, damage our
reputation with current or prospective customers, and/or expose us to product liability and other claims that could materially
and adversely affect business.

If we are unable to devote adequate resources, including retaining qualified engineering personnel, to building and scaling our
EV charging station network as expected to meet customer and regulatory requirements on a timely basis and remain
competitive with technological alternatives, this may result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations. Our EV charging network is dependent on us being able to connect to the grid and to the price at which
we are able to purchase electricity. In addition, our ability to develop our own software for use on EV chargers, which would
allow us gather data on customer use of EV chargers, is dependent on us being able to make the requisite investments in
software and back-office systems, which we may not be able to do.

In addition, the demand for EV charging stations is dependent on the adoption of electric and hybrid vehicles. Our estimates of
the market opportunity for EV charging stations and forecasts of market growth may prove to be inaccurate. There are a number
of uncertainties, including in relation to customer behavior and government intervention, that make it difficult to determine the
adoption trajectory of electric and hybrid vehicles. In particular, the European EV market currently benefits from the availability
of rebates, scrappage schemes, tax credits and other financial incentives from governments to incentivize the purchase of EVs,
which otherwise tend to be priced at a premium over combustion engine cars, as well as legislation aimed at phasing out the
sale of combustion engine cars. The reduction, modification, or elimination of such benefits or legislation could cause reduced
demand for Evs, especially at a time of higher living costs and reduced purchase power for prospective buyers of Evs, and, as
a result, EV charging, which would adversely affect our EV charging business. For example, Germany has recently pushed out
the date for the ban on combustion engine cars in the European Union, so long as such cars run on synthetic fuels, which may
reduce the demand for Evs. New alternative fuel technologies may negatively impact the growth of the EV market and thus
the demand for EV charging stations and services. If the adoption of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles is not in line with our
expectations, this may negatively impact the demand for and success of our EV charging stations.

**_Consumer preferences and perceptions in relation to food and drink may continue to change and we may be unable to adapt_**
**_to such changes._**

Our business is affected by perceptions of various types of food and drinks and there are a number of trends in consumer
preferences which could have an adverse effect on our business. These trends include preferences for convenient, natural, better
value, healthy and sustainable products. For example, concerns as to the health impacts and nutritional value of certain foods
may increasingly result in food manufacturers being encouraged or required to produce products with reduced levels of sugar,


-----

salt and fat and to eliminate trans-fatty acids and certain other ingredients. Consumer preferences are also shaped by concern
over the environmental impact of products, including their packaging and the impact of plastic packaging wastage. Consumer
tastes are also susceptible to change. For instance, many consumers are placing increasing importance on dietary and nutritional
content of food and drink products, as well as the provenance of locally sourced ingredients. As the success of our business
depends largely on the appeal of the food and drink offering of our partners, there can be no assurance that we will be able to
respond to these or other trends in consumer preference by introducing changes to our formats, brands, food and drink offerings
and premises or otherwise. Any failure to anticipate, identify and respond to trends in consumer preferences, or any significant
delay in doing so, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Future tobacco and e-cigarette legislation, campaigns to discourage smoking and vaping, increases in tobacco taxes and_**
**_wholesale cost increases of tobacco products could have a material adverse impact on our retail operating revenues and_**
**_gross margin._**

Tobacco products generate a significant portion of our sales. For the year ended December 31, 2022, tobacco products
represented 6% of the Group’s total revenue. Significant increases in wholesale cigarette costs, a tax increase on tobacco
products, as well as current and future legislation and national and local campaigns to discourage smoking in the markets in
which we operate may have an adverse impact on the demand for tobacco products, including e-cigarettes and other vaping
products, and may therefore adversely affect our revenue and profit in light of the competitive landscape and consumer
sensitivity to the price of such products.

For example, in the United States, Congress has given the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), broad authority to regulate
the manufacture, marketing and distribution of tobacco products through passage of the Family Smoking Prevention and
Tobacco Control Act (“Tobacco Control Act”). Among other things, this legislation requires manufacturers, with certain
exceptions, to obtain FDA clearance or approval for cigarette and smokeless tobacco products, requires new and larger warning
labels on tobacco products and requires FDA approval for the use of terms such as “light” or “low tar.” Under the Tobacco
Control Act, the FDA has passed regulations that restrict or prohibit the sale of cigarettes, smokeless tobacco or electroniccigarettes in various ways and give the FDA the authority to inspect retailers and levy penalties for non-compliance.

Similarly, in the European Union, the Tobacco Products Directive, entered into force on May 19, 2014 and applicable in EU
countries on May 20, 2016, lays down rules governing the manufacture, presentation and sale of tobacco and related products.
Among other things, the Tobacco Products Directive regulates cigarettes, roll your own tobacco, pipe tobacco, cigars, cigarillos,
smokeless tobacco, e-cigarettes and herbal products for smoking. In particular, the Tobacco Products Directive:

  - prohibits cigarettes and roll-your-own tobacco with characterizing flavors;

  - requires the tobacco industry to report to EU countries on the ingredients used in tobacco;

  - requires health warnings on tobacco and related products;

  - sets minimum dimensions for warnings and prohibits small packages for certain tobacco products;

  - bans promotional and misleading materials on tobacco products, e-cigarettes and herbal products for smoking;

  - introduces EU-wide tracking and tracing to combat the illicit trade of tobacco products;

  - allows EU countries to prohibit internet sales of tobacco and related products;

  - sets out safety, quality and notification requirements for e-cigarettes; and

  - obliges manufacturers and importers to notify EU countries about novel tobacco products before placing them on the
EU market.

Governmental actions and regulations such as those noted above, as well as certain smoking bans in restaurants and other public
places, combined with the diminishing social acceptance of smoking, have caused the number of smokers in the general
population to decline. A change in consumer behavior from cigarettes to e-cigarettes and vapes is also expected to contribute
to the decline in sale volume for tobacco products, and such decline may not be offset by an increase in the volume of vape
products we sell since regulation prohibits us from selling vape products in certain of our markets. For example, in Australia,
vape products can only be sold in pharmacies to consumers with a prescription. The foregoing factors have resulted in reduced
tobacco industry volume, and we expect that such volume will continue to decline. These and any similar future governmental
actions and changes in consumer behavior could materially impact our retail price of cigarettes, cigarette unit volume and


-----

revenues, merchandise gross profit and overall customer traffic, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, we could be sued for health problems caused by the use of tobacco products. In fact, various health-related legal
actions, proceedings and claims arising out of the sale, distribution, manufacturing, development, advertising and marketing of
cigarettes have been brought against vendors of tobacco products. Any unfavorable verdict against us in a health-related suit
could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Furthermore, these events may affect our relationships with our suppliers. For example, in February 2020, the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration restricted flavored vaping products in order to minimize the appeal of e-cigarettes to younger users in the
United States. Several U.S. states, including New York, California and Massachusetts have also temporarily or permanently
banned the sale of flavored e-cigarettes, and other U.S. states and municipalities are considering implementing similar
restrictions. In addition, some cities have also implemented more restrictive measures than their state counterparts, such as San
Francisco, which in June 2019, approved a new ban on the sale of flavored nicotine products, including vaping liquids and
menthol cigarettes. To the extent we are unable to continue purchasing certain supplies from our suppliers and, as a result,
selling popular products with high margins, we may face material adverse effects to our business, financial condition, liquidity,
results of operations and prospects.

Finally, including in the United States, major cigarette manufacturers offer substantial rebates to retailers. Subject to applicable
regulations, we may include these rebates as a component of our gross margin from sales of cigarettes. In the event these rebates
are no longer offered by the manufacturer or no longer permitted by law, or are decreased accordingly, our wholesale cigarette
costs will increase accordingly. In general, we attempt to pass price increases on to our guests. However, due to competitive
pressures in our markets, we may not be able to do so. In addition, reduced retail display allowances on cigarettes offered by
cigarette manufacturers may negatively impact our gross margins. These factors could materially impact our retail price of
cigarettes, cigarette unit volume and revenues, merchandise gross profit and overall guest traffic, which could in turn have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Our growth strategy requires liquidity to support capital investments._**

Our growth strategy requires liquidity to support capital investments, and in the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, we
incurred growth capital expenditure of $373 million on acquired sites, new sites and existing sites, mainly in relation to the
refurbishment of existing sites, including extensions, minor refits of our existing PFS sites, the change in the operating model
of some of our existing sites and the rebranding of our existing sites. We will continue to require capital expenditures to grow
our portfolio by, among other things, setting up new-to-industry sites, knocking down and rebuilding sites, converting suitable
not company operated sites into COCO sites, acquiring new sites and businesses and investing in programs and technology to
consolidate our procurement, sales and marketing and back office functions. We may not be able to make such capital
expenditures if we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, choose to conserve liquidity by reducing discretionary
capital expenditure, do not have funds available for future borrowings or are restricted from incurring additional debt or as a
result of a combination of these factors. If we are unable to meet our capital expenditure plans, we may not be able to support
our operations or development strategies, which could negatively impact our competitive position and could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_A portion of our costs are fixed, and we may face difficulties in meeting them if our revenue declines._**

Our properties require regular maintenance to remain functional and attractive to customers because of the age of certain of
our properties and the nature and intensity of our uses of these properties. The costs associated with owning and operating our
sites can be significant, some of which may not allow for discretion as to timing of such maintenance capital expenditure.
Although we strive to retain flexibility in our staffing, maintaining and managing our forecourts require certain minimum
staffing levels. As a result, expenses related to our leases and employee salaries constitute our primary fixed and semi-fixed
costs. If we cannot generate free cash flow from operations necessary to cover the fixed costs arising from maintaining our
properties and minimum staffing levels, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
of operations.

**_If various national minimum wage, national living wage and holiday pay rules and regulations change or are interpreted_**
**_differently, our staff costs will increase which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and_**
**_results of operations._**

Our staff costs are affected by a number of factors, including the availability of qualified personnel, changes in service models,
budgetary pressures, national living wage and other minimum wage regulation and contractual requirements imposed by the
jurisdictions in which we operate. Increases in minimum wages and amendments to the regulations affecting the cost of labor


-----

are expected in many jurisdictions in which we operate, and could increase our expenses. In addition, we have recently
experienced high inflation and wage growth in all of the markets in which we operate, which has increased our labor costs.

If we are unable to raise the prices of our goods and services or reduce the hours worked by our staff to adequately offset these
expenses, increases in wage growth, minimum wages or changes to regulations increasing the cost of labor could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Ownership and leasing of a broad portfolio of real estate exposes us to potential losses and liabilities._**

As of June 30, 2023, after giving effect to the Transactions, 30% of our property portfolio based on the number of sites was
freehold, comprising 1,795 sites, 56% of our property portfolio based on the number of sites was leasehold (including long
leasehold), comprising 3,342 sites, 9% of our portfolio consisted of third-party sites, comprising 545 sites, 1% of our portfolio
based on the number of sites was a hybrid of freehold and leasehold, comprising 68 sites, and 3% of our portfolio based on the
number of sites was concessions, comprising 187 sites. For concession sites, we are required to bid for our rights to the site,
and if we win the respective bid, we have the right to operate the site according to the terms of our bid. The property market is
subject to fluctuations in value, and the current downturn in the commercial real estate market has led to reduction in our
freehold property values over time. See “Risk Factors— Disruptions in the financial markets, uncertain economic conditions
_and recent inflationary pressure could adversely affect the value of our real estate, which is subject to fluctuation.” There can_
be no certainty that our property values will recover from this downturn, or what the timeframe for such a recovery will be. In
the case of our leasehold properties, rents may increase such that they affect the economic viability of one or more of such
properties. Further, as leases of certain of our sites expire, we may be unable to negotiate a new lease or lease extension, either
on commercially acceptable terms, or at all, which could cause us to close our sites in desirable locations. For instance, certain
of our leasehold properties are or may in the future become subject to disputes between us and the landlords of those leasehold
properties. We have also recently completed the U.S. Sale and Leaseback, resulting in an increased number of properties in
which we are exposed to such risks relating to leased properties. In some cases, our landlords may be required to provide
consent before we are able to refurbish, rebuild or make other changes to the formats at certain of our sites. Additionally, certain
of our properties are, and may in the future become, subject to disputes between us and the landowners of adjacent properties.
Our inability to successfully resolve disputes between us and the landlords of our leasehold sites, or between us and the
landowners of adjacent sites, could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

**_Disruptions in the financial markets, uncertain economic conditions, changes in interest rates and yields on government_**
**_bonds and recent inflationary pressure could adversely affect the value of our real estate, which is subject to fluctuation._**

The property market is subject to fluctuations in value, and the value of real estate portfolio is strongly correlated to the broader
commercial real estate market. Any downturn in the property market can lead to a sustained reduction in our freehold and long
leasehold property values over time. There can be no certainty that property values will recover from any downturn at any
particular time, or at all. The commercial real estate market in particular is highly correlated with the level of interest rates and
the yields on government debt, which in certain markets may be used as a benchmark to price commercial mortgages. Interest
rates in each of the regions in which we operate have significantly increased since mid-2022 and may remain at such higher
levels for longer than initially anticipated. This increase in interest rates has also increased the cost of commercial mortgages
in each of the markets in which we operate. The yields on corporate bonds issued by real estate investment trusts (“REITs”)
and other large institutional property investors have also increased significantly in this period. Such increase in yields, along
with declining share prices of a number of such large property investors, has increased the relative cost of capital for real estate
acquisitions, which in turn has depressed commercial real estate prices. This depression in commercial real estate prices has
also negatively impacted the value of our real estate portfolio. From time to time, we commission third party valuations of our
real estate portfolio, and recent valuation reports we have seen have confirmed that the value of our real estate portfolio has
been negatively impacted. See “Business—Real Estate Reports.”

Disruptions in the financial markets could further adversely affect the value of our real estate portfolio. Concerns over an
economic recession, the COVID-19 pandemic, interest rate increases, geopolitical issues, policy priorities of the U.S.
presidential administration, trade wars, labor shortages, or inflation have in recent months contributed to increased volatility
and diminished expectations for the economy and markets. Such conditions have impacted commercial real estate fundamentals
and resulted in declining values in our real estate portfolio and in the collateral securing our indebtedness. In addition, they
may also lead to a reduction in the profitability of our sites, which would in turn result in a reduction in the trading value of our
commercial real estate portfolio, which is based on its trading value based on current use. In particular, rising inflation,
including as a result of pandemic relief and stimulus legislation in the markets in which we operate and/or economic or market
and supply chain conditions, can also put upward pressure on interest rates and could be among the factors that could lead to
higher interest rates in the future. Higher interest rates could adversely affect our overall business, and income, including by


-----

reducing the fair value of many of our assets and our real estate portfolio, and adversely affecting our ability to obtain financing
on favorable terms or at all. The financial markets could also tighten with respect to secured real estate financing and potential
lenders may increase their credit spreads resulting in an increase in borrowing costs.

**_Valuations and appraisals of our properties and real estate-related assets are estimates of value and may not necessarily_**
**_correspond to realizable value._**

The valuation methodologies used to value our properties and certain real estate-related assets involve subjective judgments
regarding such factors as comparable sales, rental revenue and operating expense data, known contingencies, the capitalization
or discount rate, and projections of future rent and expenses based on appropriate analysis. As a result, valuations and appraisals
of our properties and real estate-related assets, including the Real Estate Reports, are only estimates of current market value
and are based on various assumptions. Ultimate realization of the value of an asset or liability depends to a great extent on
economic and other conditions beyond our control and other parties involved in the valuation of our assets and liabilities.
Further, these valuations may not necessarily represent the price at which an asset or liability would sell, because market prices
of assets and liabilities can only be determined by negotiation between a willing buyer and seller. Therefore, the valuations of
our real estate portfolio may not correspond to the timely realizable value upon a sale of those assets and liabilities.

**_We are exposed to risks related to joint ventures and other arrangements._**

We have entered, and may continue to enter, into joint venture and other arrangements. These activities involve risks and
uncertainties, including the risk of the joint venture or applicable entity failing to satisfy its obligations, which may result in
certain liabilities to us for guarantees or other commitments. Additional risks involve the challenges in achieving strategic
objectives and expected benefits of the business arrangement, including the risk of conflicts arising between us and others and
the difficulty of managing and resolving such conflicts and the difficulty of managing or otherwise monitoring such business
arrangements.

**_The financial information included in this Offering Memorandum may not be representative of our operations going_**
**_forward or otherwise comparable to our current operating results._**

As a result of the UK Disposal to Asda, the U.S. Sale and Leaseback and certain other smaller asset sales, including the strategic
disposals currently under consideration in the UK, the historical financial statements of the Group included in this offering
memorandum may not be indicative of what our results of operations, financial position and cash flows will be in the future
because these operations will no longer be included in our financial results following their sale. In addition, the entities being
disposed in connection with the UK Disposal to Asda and the Non-Core Asset Disposals have been classified as a disposal
group, held for sale on our balance sheet. If we enter into definitive contracts to sell the Retained UK&I Business (excluding
the ‘evpoint’ business, the Cooplands business, the KFC Business and the Starbucks Business) to Zuber Issa and the KFC
Business to a third party, we would expect to report these businesses too as assets held for sale on our balance sheet, pending
completion of the deals. While these businesses are currently classified as ‘held for sale’ on our balance sheet, developments
in the businesses and their results will continue to impact our results of operations until the completion of the sales.

Furthermore, in order to aid the comparability of the financial condition and results of the operations of the Group, after giving
effect to (i) the UK Disposal to Asda, the Non-Core Asset Disposals and the U.S. Sale and Leaseback as of and for the twelve
months ended June 30, 2023, the year ended December 31, 2021, the year ended December 31, 2022, the six months ended
June 30, 2022 and the six months ended June 30, 2023 and (ii) UK Disposal to Asda, the Non-Core Asset Disposals, the U.S.
Sale and Leaseback and certain estimated EBITDA annualizations, group initiatives and synergies as of and for the twelve
months ended June 30, 2023, we have presented certain historical financial information on an as adjusted basis or on a pro
forma basis. We have not purported to adjust our financial information presented in this Offering Memorandum to give effect
to the strategic disposals currently under considerations in the United Kingdom, which remain subject to contract and definitive
documentation.

Such as adjusted information is based on available information and certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable. Such
information is presented for information purposes only and is not intended to represent or be indicative of the financial condition
or results of operations that we would have reported had such transactions actually occurred during the periods and as of the
dates presented, and such as adjusted information does not purport to project our results of operations or financial condition as
of any future date or for any future period. This information has not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of
Regulation S-X of the Securities Act, the Prospectus Regulation or any generally accepted accounting standards. Neither the
assumptions underlying such as adjusted information nor the resulting figures have been audited or reviewed.

In addition, this Offering Memorandum contains certain preliminary unaudited financial results for the three months ended
September 30, 2023. Upon completion of our review of the results for the three months ended September 30, 2023, it is possible


-----

significant changes to such preliminary results may be necessary. Finally, such preliminary unaudited financial results do not
reflect all of our material financial information as of and for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and we therefore
caution you not to place undue reliance on them. See “Forward-Looking Statements” for a discussion of factors that may cause
our actual results to vary from our estimates and “Summary—Current Trading” for more detail. Our actual results may vary
from our preliminary results for the three months ended September 30, 2023 included in the “Summary—Current Trading” and
the variances may be material.

In light of the foregoing, the financial information included in this Offering Memorandum may not be representative of our
actual or future results and performance.

**_Currency exchange rates may have an impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations._**

Our results of operations are subject to foreign currency translation and transaction effects because we have operations in
Australia, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland and
the United States, which are and will be conducted primarily in the respective local currency, and because we source products
from suppliers worldwide. Our results of operations may be affected by both the transaction effects and the translation effects
of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.

When we are required to pay our debt, purchase fuel, meet our fixed costs or pay for services in currencies outside of our
respective operations’ jurisdictions, we are exposed to unrealized and realized gains and losses due to foreign exchange,
depending on fluctuations in exchange rates. For example, in Europe we purchase a portion of our fuel under our fuel supply
agreements in U.S. dollars but we sell fuel to our customers in euro. Where we are unable to match sales received in foreign
currencies with costs paid in the same currency, our results of operations are consequently impacted by currency exchange rate
fluctuations. In addition, our business may be negatively affected if foreign currency movements provide non-local suppliers
with competitive pricing advantages.

In addition, we have or may have in the future intra-group and external loans where the denomination of the loan is in a currency
other than the U.S. dollar. As of June 30, 2023, 56% of our third-party debt would have been denominated in a currency other
than the U.S. dollar. Exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the pound sterling, euro and Australian dollar can be volatile,
and fluctuations in these and other currencies in which we operate now and in the future may have a substantial effect on our
financial statements due to related gains or losses resulting from the conversion into U.S. dollar of foreign currencydenominated monetary assets and liabilities.

We are also exposed to foreign exchange risk through the translation of the financial statements from our functional currencies
to the U.S. dollar. Our income and expenses are reported in the relevant local currency and translated into U.S. dollar at the
applicable currency exchange rate for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, our financial results in any
given period are materially affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the other currencies in which we
have costs and expenses. These translations could significantly affect the comparability of our results between financial periods
and result in significant changes to the carrying value of our assets, liabilities and equity. The U.S. dollar’s relative strength
against the currencies in other countries in which we operate means that, among other things, our foreign revenue, profit for
the period and EBITDA, which are reported to our investors in U.S. dollar, will be lower than if the U.S. dollar were stronger
relative to those currencies.

We continuously evaluate appropriate hedging strategies to offset the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our cash flows
and/or earnings. Our hedging practices, including the natural hedge of our matched earnings split against cash flows and debts,
may not completely insulate us from currency exchange risks and may involve costs and risks of their own since hedging
involves speculation and significant judgment. Forward contracts are also used in M&A transactions to mitigate potential
exchange rate movement between signature and completion of either a significant acquisition or disposal, including in
connection with the UK Disposal to Asda on a deal contingent basis where we have hedged substantial sales proceeds in pound
sterling to provide certainty of debt prepayments due in U.S. dollar, euro and Australian dollar. Our hedging activities therefore
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We are subject to extensive regulation and legislation which could adversely affect our business._**

The sector in which we operate is subject to extensive regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate, and any changes to
applicable regulations may adversely affect our business, including accounting, tax, corporate governance, licensing, antimoney laundering, bribery and corruption, sanctions, pricing, competition and consumer protection, alcohol and tobacco
licensing, sale of fresh and packaged food products, lottery tickets, money orders, hours of service and related commercial
trucking regulations, parking, disability and public accessibility regulations, employment and pension, property transfer, as
well as other laws and regulations. For example, local planning authorities control the planning for new forecourt development,


-----

which is often a lengthy and uncertain process. If these processes become less stringent, we could face increased competition
and a reduced market share for us. Certain of our operations also depend on concessions, authorizations, licenses and permits
from governmental regulatory agencies in the countries in which we operate, which are subject to expiration, limitation on
renewal and various other risks and uncertainties. Our inability to obtain such items, including, for example, highway
concessions, or negotiate their renewal on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

In certain jurisdictions, specific legislation may exist or be enacted which impacts the driving behavior of our customers,
including, for example, mandatory routes for goods transit vehicles on which we may not have a presence. In addition,
legislative initiatives relating to food safety, such as Natasha’s law in the United Kingdom, which requires businesses to list all
the ingredients on individual packaging of products that are considered pre-packed for direct sale (“PPDS”), have increased
the risks we face associated with food preparation and storage. Furthermore, pricing for our products and services may be
regulated. Any violation of applicable laws and regulations could result in prosecution, penalties, sanctions (including
mandatory shut-downs), loss of our licenses, injunctive actions, damages, fines, fees, increased costs of operation and
compliance or a reduced ability to compete, among others, any of which could impact our reputation, revenue and profit and
have a material adverse effect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Likewise, any changes to the laws or restrictions applicable to us and our industry could negatively impact our competitive
position and have a material adverse effect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

The passing of, or changes in, applicable laws or regulations, or evolving interpretations thereof may result in increased
compliance costs, capital expenditures and other financial obligations which may impede the production or distribution of our
products or the provision of our services, which could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, financial
condition or prospects. For example, many of the products we sell, such as soft drinks, contain sugar. The trend toward increased
end-consumer focus on health and fitness, as well as public concerns about obesity, have in recent years led to the consideration
governments of new taxes on certain food and drinks products, including sugar-sweetened drinks. In particular, the
governments of many European countries, including the United Kingdom and France, as well as the authorities of an increasing
member of large U.S. cities, such as Philadelphia in Pennsylvania and San Francisco in California, have imposed a soft drinks
industry levy (“SDIL”) or other similar tax on soft drink and soft drink companies have been required to pay a charge for drinks
with added sugar content. For instance, in France, a sugar tax of €0.11 per 1.5 liter on drinks with added sugars or artificial
sweeteners has been introduced. If other authorities take a similar approach to and impose tax, advertisement restrictions or
content restrictions on other products with a content of sugar, salt, caffeine, fat, or other ingredients deemed harmful above
certain thresholds, or if the competent authorities in other jurisdictions in which we operate introduce similar regulation or
taxation, we could incur additional costs to comply. The costs of researching and developing products that fall within any
content restrictions that these governments may impose, or the expense of paying any taxes imposed on products on the basis
of sugar or other content by percentage (if we are not able to pass through the costs of such taxes), could have a material adverse
effect on our operation results. Our operating results would also be adversely affected if consumer demand declined due to
price increases or advertisement restrictions, or if legislation were expanded to cover a broader scope of health factors, such as
limiting calories or reducing salt-content.

**_Costs to comply with, or to address liabilities arising under, current and future applicable regulations could adversely affect_**
**_our business and our financial condition._**

Our operations, properties and products are, and may in the future be, subject to various environmental, health and safety
(“EHS”) laws and regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. These requirements can, among other matters,
impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the air, soil and water, establish standards for the treatment, storage and
disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, require investigation and clean-up of contaminated sites, require the installation of
costly pollution control equipment or facilities and set standards for workplace health and safety. We may also be required to
obtain permits for certain operations, which are subject to modification and renewal. Failure to comply with these requirements
could result in notices of violation or enforcement proceedings against us, which could include sanctions and/or financial
penalties.

Certain environmental laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation, and Liability Act in the United States and the Environment Action Programmes of the European Union, can
impose joint and several liability for cleanup costs, without regard to fault, on current and former owners and operators of real
property that has been impacted by release of hazardous substances or on persons who have disposed of, arranged for the
disposal of or released hazardous substances into the environment. In particular, we have in the past been, and will in the future
be, required to address liabilities for the investigation, cleanup or monitoring of contaminated soil and groundwater associated
with our current or former facilities or operations (or those of our predecessors) and we could also be liable for the costs of


-----

responding to and remediating releases of hazardous materials migrating off-site from these properties, as well as the restoration
of natural resources damaged by such releases, among other things. Substantially all of our properties have or in the past had
storage tanks to store motor fuel or petroleum products. A substantial number of the existing underground storage tanks are old
and may require replacement or costly upgrades to reduce the risk of leaks that could impact soil or groundwater and result in
substantial clean-up obligations or damages. We could also be held responsible for contamination relating to third-party sites
to which we or our predecessors have sent hazardous materials. In connection with the acquisitions we have completed and, in
particular, the large proportion of PFS sites in our network that we purchased from major fuel distributors, we may not have
identified all of the potential environmental liabilities associated with these sites, including as a result of historical operations.
We may need to spend substantial amounts of money and other resources from time to time to undertake investigative or
remedial actions, construct and maintain remedial equipment, and clean up and/or decommission waste management facilities.
If we do not comply with such environmental requirements, or if we are determined to be legally responsible for a release of
hazardous substances, regulatory agencies could seek to impose civil, administrative and/or criminal liabilities in addition to
the costs of clean-up. Under some circumstances, private parties could also seek to impose civil fines or penalties for violations
of environmental law or recover monetary damages, including those relating to property damage or personal injury or illnesses
or injuries allegedly related to exposure to hazardous substances associated with our facilities or our operations or in our
products. Our ability to sell, rent or finance any such property may also be adversely affected.

We currently incur substantial operating and capital costs for compliance with existing EHS and other laws and regulations
applicable to our operations, and these costs may increase in the future. See “—Environmental, social and governance matters
_may impact our business and reputation.” These costs include, but are not limited to, costs related to staff training, fire_
certifications, permits, licenses, inspections, maintenance and replacement of equipment, risk assessments and remediation.
We cannot predict with any certainty our future capital expenditure requirements necessary to comply with applicable
environmental laws and regulations due to changing environmental technologies and compliance standards which have tended
to become increasingly strict. From time to time, we could be subject to requests for information, notices of violation or
investigations initiated by environmental regulatory agencies relating to our operations and properties. Furthermore, new
violations or newly discovered contamination (including contamination caused by prior owners and operators of such sites)
could result in additional unanticipated compliance or remediation costs or other liabilities, which could be material.

We may also assume environmental liabilities in future acquisitions, which could individually or in the aggregate have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If the actual costs to address current or
future environmental liabilities, including violations under environmental laws, exceed the provisions we have for such matters,
the impact may be materially adverse to our business, liquidity or financial condition.

**_Environmental, social and governance matters may impact our business and reputation._**

There has been increased focus by regulators, consumers, investors, employees, and other stakeholders, as well as by
governmental and non-governmental organizations, on ESG. This has resulted in expanding and increasingly complex
mandatory and voluntary reporting, diligence, and disclosure on ESG topics. These developments and other rapidly changing
laws, regulations, policies and related interpretations, as well as increased enforcement actions or investigations by various
governmental and regulatory agencies and increased litigation risk from private parties, may alter the environment in which we
do business and may increase the ongoing costs of compliance, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

Any failure or perceived failure to meet our ESG commitments or targets, or loss of confidence, or inability to meet expectations
on the part of customers, investors, employees and other stakeholders as it relates to our ESG initiatives could negatively impact
our business relationships, and the demand for our products. These impacts could be difficult and costly to address, even if
such concerns were based on inaccurate or misleading information. In addition, failure of our suppliers, partners, vendors or of
third party brands we partner with to meet ESG commitments or expectations may cause us reputational harm, negatively
impact our business relationships and the demand for our products and may, in certain cases, cause us to terminate our
relationship with such third parties, including on short notice.

In addition, our ESG initiatives, including achieving our ESG commitments, may result in increased costs in our supply chain
and/or business operations. Standards regarding ESG initiatives could change and become more onerous for us to meet
successfully. Evolving data and research could undermine or refute our current claims and beliefs that we have made in reliance
on current research, which could also result in additional costs or a decrease in revenue, negative market perception and
increased scrutiny that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

A variety of organizations purport to measure the performance of companies on such ESG topics, and the results of these
assessments are widely publicized. Topics taken into account in such assessments include, among others, a company’s efforts


-----

and impacts on climate change and human rights, ethics and compliance with law and the role of a company’s board of directors
in supervising various sustainability issues. In light of stakeholders’ increased focus on ESG matters, there can be no certainty
that we will manage such issues successfully, or that we will successfully meet all ESG expectations or achieve our financial
goals. As part of our commitment to ESG matters, we have introduced specific, quantifiable ESG targets which are set out in
our 2022 ESG Report. See “Business—ESG & Sustainability.” If we fail to meet the targets of these or other key performance
indicators to measure our progress towards our ESG goals, we may suffer reputational damage, which could in turn have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Food safety issues and food-borne illness, whether actual or reported, or the failure to comply with applicable regulations_**
**_relating to the transportation, storage, preparation or service of food, may adversely affect our business and reputation._**

Food safety, food traceability and hygiene are top priorities in our Grocery & Merchandise and Foodservice operations, and
we dedicate substantial resources to ensure that our customers enjoy safe, quality food products in a clean environment. Foodrelated risks to the health of our customers can arise from our supply and logistics chain, which we cannot always control, at
our Grocery & Merchandise stores and Foodservice outlets and concessions, including those directly and indirectly owned or
managed by us. Instances or reports, whether verified or not, of food safety issues, such as food-borne illnesses (including
allergic reactions by customers), food tampering, food contamination or mislabeling, during growing, manufacturing,
packaging, transportation, storage or preparation, have in the past significantly damaged the reputations and impacted the sales
of companies in the food processing, grocery, quick service and “fast casual” restaurant sectors, and could affect us as well. In
addition, instances of food-borne illness, food tampering or food contamination occurring at our own or other franchised stores
of our brand partners could also impact our sales volume and revenue as a result of negative publicity about the food service
industry generally.

Although we and our partners maintain operational controls and provide employee training at our locations aimed at preventing
food-borne illnesses, food tampering and other food safety issues, we can provide no assurance that these measures will be
sufficient to prevent these issues. In recent years, our acquisition of proprietary foodservices brands such as Cumberland Farms,
Cooplands and OMV, as well as evolution of consumer preferences towards a higher standard for food safety, have led to an
increase in the risks associated with food preparation and storage. Any report or publicity linking us, one of our partners or
their brands to instances of food-borne illness or other food safety issues, including food tampering or contamination, could
adversely affect customer footfall at our sites or the reputation of the brands we offer which could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For instance, if these or other food safety issues were to
arise in connection with food produced at the Cumberland Farms’ food service production facility, we could be forced to
withdraw or recall the affected products, destroy our inventory or temporarily close the facility.

Any actual or alleged illness (including allergic reactions) or other harm stemming from food safety issues at our locations or
our production facility could lead to litigation or regulatory action. Any significant lawsuit or widespread product recall or
other events leading to the loss of consumer confidence in the safety and quality of our proprietary brands or those of our
partners could damage our reputation and the value of our brand and could negatively impact our sales, profitability and
prospects for growth. In addition, product recalls are difficult to foresee and prepare for and, in the event we are required to
recall one or more of our products, such recall may result in loss of sales due to unavailability of our products and may take up
a significant amount of our management’s time and attention.

**_Pending or future litigation and adverse publicity, including litigation and the related publicity concerning food quality,_**
**_consumer health and other related issues, could result in significant liabilities or litigation costs, cause consumers to avoid_**
**_our convenience retail locations and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows._**

We are subject to numerous risks relating to legal, civil, tax, regulatory and competition proceedings which could develop in
the future. Such proceedings could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations. We cannot assure you what the ultimate outcome of any particular proceeding will be. In particular,
the nature of our industry exposes us to significant civil and criminal liability for personal injuries and other torts, and our
operations carry a higher exposure to consumer litigation risk when compared to the operations of companies operating in
many other industries. For example, we store, transfer and dispense fuel, the disposal of which is heavily regulated. If we
improperly dispose of our fuel stock, including through accidental contamination, we may face heavy litigation from victims
who have been harmed by our action or regulatory agencies seeking to prevent such harm. In addition, our convenience retailer
operations are characterized by a high volume of guest traffic and thousands of customers and vehicles travel to our forecourts
every day, 24 hours per day, 365 days per year, and several of our locations are situated directly adjacent to motorways and
highways from which cars enter our premises at high speeds, which increase the likelihood of collisions and explosions. These
and other types of harm, including those related to personal liability, product liability, food safety, food-traceability, food-borne
illness and hygiene-related concerns, resulting from our operations could cause the injury or death of our employees, our


-----

customers and third parties as well as property damage. Additionally, we are occasionally exposed to industry-wide or classaction claims arising from the products we offer or industry-specific business practices. Convenience retailer businesses and
other food service operators can be adversely affected by litigation and complaints from guests or government agencies
resulting from food quality, illness, or other health or environmental concerns. In locations where we serve fresh food, a
potential lack of fresh food handling experience among the workforce increases the risk of food borne illness resulting in
litigation and reputational damage. If any such harms were to occur, the consequences for our business could include legal
investigations and enforcement, penalties and fines, lawsuits, increased insurance costs, trading losses, service area closures,
reduced revenue and criminal charges, such as corporate manslaughter. Adverse publicity about these allegations may harm
our reputation and negatively affect us, regardless of whether the allegations are true, by discouraging guests from purchasing
fuel, merchandise or food at one or more of our convenience retail locations. We could also incur significant liabilities if a
lawsuit or claim results in a decision against us. Even if we are successful in defending such litigation, our litigation costs could
be significant, and the litigation may divert time and money away from our operations and adversely affect our performance.
Any of these consequences, particularly when taken together and given that our insurance policies may not cover these claims,
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, we are, and may in the future be, a party to judicial, arbitration and regulatory proceedings that arise in the ordinary
course of business, including claims relating to compulsory land purchases by government authorities and claims relating to
defects in development projects performed or services rendered. In the event of a compulsory land purchase, we are entitled to
compensation equivalent to the full market value of the property, but we may be subject to, or enter into, regulatory proceedings
or disputes if we fail to complete a compulsory purchase order or if compensation is less than our assessment of the fair market
value. In addition, we rely on third-party contractors to provide construction services, including at our new-to-industry and
other freehold sites, and we are exposed to risks in connection with projects carried out by third-party contractors, including
construction defects or failure by third-party contractors to repair such construction defects. Failure to resolve such disputes in
a timely or cost-effective manner could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

**_Our operations are subject to operational hazards and our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover our losses._**

Our operations are subject to operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions such as natural disasters, adverse weather,
accidents, fires, explosions, hazardous materials releases, mechanical failures, disruptions in supply infrastructure or logistics
and other events beyond our control. If any of these events were to occur, we could incur substantial losses in connection with
claims alleging personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment, and pollution or
other environmental or natural resource damages, which could result in us incurring significant unbudgeted costs or in
curtailment or suspension of our related operations.

Each of our insurance policies is subject to certain limitations. We are not fully insured against all risks inherent to our business
and we may face liabilities or losses that are not adequately covered by our insurance. Further, our insurance policies might
provide for high deductibles (or excess payments), which could impose a significant strain on our capital before we are able to
recover under our insurance policies. Additionally, if we make claims under our insurance policies, we could face higher
premiums or be unable to renew or purchase new insurance in the future. Each of our insurance policies includes a variety of
requirements and conditions that we must satisfy to maintain our coverage or to receive payment under an insurance policy. At
times, we have not been in compliance with the requirements and conditions of our insurance policy and there is a risk that this
might reoccur in the future. If we are not in compliance with the requirements or conditions of an insurance policy or if we lack
sufficient coverage under an insurance policy for our claims, we may be completely denied coverage for our claim or only be
inadequately insured. Such an inadequate insurance coverage could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

**_A loss of key personnel or of our ability to attract and retain experienced members of management, qualified employees and_**
**_other key personnel could adversely affect our business._**

Our success depends on both our ability to retain members of our senior management, many of whom have significant
experience in our business and industry, and our ability to attract and retain a workforce that includes experienced marketing,
finance and operating personnel. As disclosed in “Recent Developments,” Zuber Issa and Salim Hasan intend to step down as
Co-CEO and Chief Operating Officer of EG Group, respectively, with Zuber Issa remaining on our Board as non-executive
director, upon completion of the potential sale to Zuber Issa of the majority of the Retained UK&I Business. Such potential
changes to our senior management could harm our business operations and culture and there can be no assurance that we would
be able to promptly fill any gaps left by these resignations. There can further be no assurance that we will continue to attract or
retain the qualified personnel, with the required skills, needed for our business. Our failure to recruit and retain key personnel
or qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.


-----

**_Our shareholders’ and directors’ interests may conflict with your interests as a holder of the Notes._**

Certain investment funds managed by or affiliated with TDR Capital indirectly own, together with Zuber Vali Issa and Mohsin
Issa, a controlling interest in our capital stock. Our shareholders have control over our decisions to enter into any corporate
transaction and have the ability to prevent any transaction that requires the approval of our board of directors or stockholders,
regardless of whether the holders of the Notes believe that any such transactions are in their own best interest. For example,
our shareholders could cause us to make acquisitions that increase the amount of our indebtedness, including secured
indebtedness, or to sell assets, which may impair our ability to make payments under the Notes. In addition, TDR Capital is in
the business of making investments in companies and may, from time to time, acquire and hold interests in businesses that
compete directly or indirectly with us. TDR Capital may also pursue acquisitions that may be complementary with our business
and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. So long as our shareholders continue to indirectly
own a significant amount of the outstanding shares of our common stock, even if such amount is less than 50%, our shareholders
will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisions. Furthermore, certain members of our Board
are also directors of Asda Group Limited. This may give rise to a conflict of interest for such directors in circumstances where
the interests of Asda Group Limited are not aligned with the Group’s interests. See “Management—Conflicts of Interest”.

Our shareholders may make strategic decisions with regards to their ownership of the Group that may not be aligned with the
interests of holders of the Notes. For instance, they may seek to acquire further ownership interests or dispose their existing
ownership interests in the Group. They may also seek to engage in other strategic transactions relating to the Group or there
ownership thereof, such as spinning-off parts of the Group or engaging in acquisitions that increase the overall leverage of the
Group. Such transactions may not be in the best interests of the Group or the holders or the Notes.

**_We may enter into transactions with related parties on terms that are less favorable to us than would be the case if such_**
**_transactions had not been with related parties_**

From time to time, we may enter into transactions with affiliates that may be considered related party transactions. For example,
we completed the sale of the majority of our business in the United Kingdom to Asda, which is also controlled by our
shareholders, on October 31, 2023. The headline consideration (including estimated net debt and working capital adjustments)
was £2 billion. With respect to certain related parties with whom we have regular ongoing transactions, our Board has approved
master agreements governing such transactions. For instance, we have a master wholesale agreement in place with Asda which
provides the terms and conditions governing our purchase of certain products (including products owned, developed, licensed
and/or produced by Asda as well as third party products) from Asda. We disclose all material related party transactions in our
financial statements and have implemented certain policies and procedures whereby certain employees screen each of the
material transactions for any possible affiliations between us and companies controlled by us or our shareholders. See note 37
–“Related party transactions” to the 2022 EG Group Audited Financial Statements appearing herein for further disclosure on
our related party transactions. For the year ended December 31, 2022 and for the six month period ending June 30, 2023, our
Audit & Risk Committee reviewed this disclosure and satisfied themselves that there were no additional related parties that had
not already been identified nor related party transactions that had not been adequately disclosed. In addition, at each quarterly
meeting of our Board, we submit a related party report to our Board which details any related party transactions entered into
during that quarter which do not fall within a master framework agreement and therefore require specific approval by our
Board, as well as a summary of transactional spend with each of our related parties. For more details on related party
transactions, see “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Transactions with Related Parties.” Although our
corporate governance guidelines require that we engage in any related party transactions on an arm’s length basis, there can be
no assurance that the terms of any such transactions will be as favorable to us as would be the case had they not been with
related parties.

**_Failure to maintain good employee relations may affect our operations and the success of our business._**

As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 56,647 employees located across the jurisdictions in which we operate, with
approximately 56% of our workforce located in Europe, approximately 36% in the United States and approximately 9% located
in Australia. Our workforce has been increasing in the past years as our site numbers have grown, and in connection with
Foodservice penetration on our sites and COCO conversions we have completed. A portion of our European, United States and
Australian employees are members of trade unions. There is no assurance that other groups of our employees will not unionize
in the future. Certain of our employees are also covered by national collective bargaining agreements and company-level
agreements. These agreements typically complement applicable statutory provisions in respect of, among other things, the
general working conditions of our employees such as working time, holidays, termination, retirement, welfare and incentives.
National collective bargaining agreements and EG Group-specific agreements also contain provisions that could affect our
ability to restructure our operations and facilities, terminate employees or outsource certain services. We may not be able to
extend existing agreements, renew them on their current terms, or, upon the expiration of such agreements, negotiate such


-----

agreements in a favorable and timely manner or without work stoppages, strikes or similar industrial actions. We may also
become subject to additional or amended agreements, which may increase our operating costs and have an adverse effect on
our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Consultations with works councils, strikes, similar industrial actions or other disturbances by our workforce, particularly where
there are union delegates, could disrupt or delay our operations, including the integration of an acquired business into our
Group, result in a loss of reputation, increased wages and benefits or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

Maintaining good relationships with our employees, unions and other employee representatives is crucial to our ability to
successfully operate our business. As we are continuously restructuring our workforce to achieve productivity gains, including
through staff reductions as part of our initiatives on cost saving synergies, our relationships with our employees, unions and
other employee representatives may become strained. Any deterioration of these relationships could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We are also exposed to risks involving the workforce of our third-party suppliers and partners. In particular, a labor stoppage
or other interruption at one of our suppliers or partners would impact our ability to supply our sites and could have a more
pronounced effect on our operations as a result. As we do not directly control our suppliers and partners or their operations, we
have no control over and limited information on labor relations between our suppliers and partners and their respective
workforces.

**_Changes in credit and debit card provider requirements, payment methodologies or applicable regulations could adversely_**
**_affect our business._**

A substantial portion of our sales is made to customers who pay for their purchases with credit or debit cards rather than cash,
and a growing number of our customers may be using contactless payment options through Apple Pay or similar technologies,
and as a result we are exposed to a variety of risks associated with credit and debit cards and existing and potential new
contactless payment methods. For credit and debit card payments, including through Apple Pay and similar technologies, we
pay interchange and other fees. These fees may increase over time and therefore increase our operating expenses and adversely
affect our results of operations. We are also subject to payment card association operating rules, certification requirements and
rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to
comply. We can also be subject to fraud and other crimes related to the unauthorized use of credit and debit card information
of our clients, which could harm our reputation and subject us to expensive and time-consuming litigation. Any failure to
comply with applicable requirements or regulations may subject us to fines and higher transaction fees, the loss of our ability
to accept credit and debit card and contactless payments from our customers or the cessation of payments from credit and debit
card and contactless payment providers to us for purchases already made. We may also experience disruptions or other
difficulties with credit card providers or electronic payment systems, which may cause difficulties for us and our customers.
Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We handle personal data in the ordinary course of our business, and any failure to maintain the confidentiality of that data_**
**_could result in legal liability for us and reputational harm to our business._**

We are subject to regulations and data protection and privacy laws in all the jurisdictions in which we operate regarding the
use of personal data and debit and credit card data. We collect, process and in some cases store personal data of customers and
employees (some of which may be sensitive) as part of our business and therefore must comply with strict data protection and
privacy laws. Such laws restrict our ability to collect and use personal information relating to customers including the use of
that information for marketing purposes. We rely on our own employees to maintain our databases and seek to ensure that
procedures are in place to ensure compliance with data protection laws and regulations. Unauthorized data disclosure could
occur through cybersecurity breaches as a result of human error, external hacking, malware infection, malicious or accidental
user activity, internal security breaches, and physical security breaches due to unauthorized personnel gaining physical access.
We have policies and procedures in place to seek to prevent breaches and carry out detailed root cause analysis on any breach
that does occur in order to ensure that similar occurrences do not arise.

Among other things, this could also result in a breach of laws and regulations under which we operate, including Regulation
(EU) 2016/679 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of
such data (the “GDPR”), which became effective on May 25, 2018, and which imposes additional obligations on companies
regarding the handling of personal data and provides certain individual privacy rights to persons whose data is processed. Since
we are subject to the supervision of relevant data protection authorities under both the GDPR and the United Kingdom General
Data Protection Regulation and Data Protection Act 2018 (the “UK GDPR”), we could be fined under each of those regimes
independently in respect of the same breach. Penalties for certain breaches are up to the greater of €20.0 million (£17.5 million)


-----

or 4% of our global annual turnover. In addition to fines, a breach of the GDPR or UK GDPR may result in regulatory
investigations, reputational damage, orders to cease and/or change our data processing activities, enforcement notices,
assessment notices (for a compulsory audit) and/or civil claims (including class actions).

Notwithstanding such efforts, we are exposed to the risk that these data could be wrongfully appropriated, lost or disclosed, or
processed in breach of data protection regulation. Our failure to comply with privacy, data protection and information security
laws could result in potentially significant regulatory and/or governmental investigations and/or actions, litigation, fines,
sanctions and damage to our reputation.

If we fail to store or transmit customer information and payment details in a secure manner, or if any loss of personal customer
data were otherwise to occur due to hacking, technical failures or other factors, we could face liability under data protection
laws or sanctions by card merchants. This could also result in the loss of the goodwill of our customers and deter new customers,
any or a combination of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Our failure to adequately protect our sensitive information and operational technology systems and critical data and our_**
**_service providers’ failure to protect their systems and data could have a material adverse effect on us._**

Our day-to-day operations increasingly depend on information and operational technology systems that we manage, and other
systems that our third parties, such as our service providers, vendors, and equipment providers, manage.

These systems are subject to risks associated with growing and evolving cyber incidents or attacks. These risks include, but are
not limited to, human error, power outages, computer and telecommunication failures, natural disasters, fraud or malice, social
engineering or phishing attacks, viruses or malware, and other cyberattacks, such as denial-of-service or ransomware attacks.
Reports indicate that entities or groups, including cybercriminals, competitors, and nation state actors, have mounted cyberattacks on businesses and other organizations solely to disable or disrupt computer systems, disrupt operations and, in some
cases, steal data.

Also, many of our non-operational employees work remotely a significant amount of their time, which has created certain
operational risks, such as an increased risk of security breaches or other cyber incidents or attacks, loss of data, fraud and other
disruptions as more fully outlined, above. Working remotely has significantly increased the use of technological and online
telecommunication services and remote networking, which enable employees to work outside of our corporate infrastructure
and, in some cases, use their own personal devices. This remote work model has resulted in an increased demand for
technological resources and may expose us to additional risks of cyber-incidents or attacks, security breaches, loss of data,
fraud and other disruptions as a consequence of more employees accessing sensitive and critical information remotely. Due to
the nature of cyberattacks, breaches to our systems or our service or equipment providers’ systems could go undetected for a
prolonged period of time. A breach could also compromise or originate from our customers’, vendors’, or other third-party
systems or networks outside of our control. A security breach may result in legal claims or proceedings against us by our
employees, customers, vendors and governmental authorities. We do not currently maintain insurance coverage that is intended
to address cybersecurity and data protection risks. There is no assurance that the costs or losses suffered as a result of
cybersecurity breaches would be covered by our general insurance policies and such costs could have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition, reputation, and results of operations.

We have been, and from time to time may continue to be, subject to cyber-attacks. For example in the third quarter of 2023,
our facilities in Breda, the Netherlands, were the target of a cyber-attack, whereby Company email accounts were compromised,
resulting in a loss of $1.7 million that will not be covered by our insurance policy. While we maintain a cybersecurity program,
which includes administrative, technical, and organizational safeguards, a significant cyberattack or incident—either with our
systems or a critical third-party’s systems—has disrupted and could again in the disrupt our operations and has resulted and
could further result in downtime, loss of revenue, harm to our reputation, or the loss, theft, corruption or unauthorized release
of critical data of us or those with whom we do business, as well as result in higher costs to correct and remedy the effects of
such incidents, including potential extortion payments associated with ransomware or ransom demands. If, in the future, our or
our service or equipment providers’, safeguards maintained for protecting against cyber incidents or attacks prove to be
insufficient, and other incidents were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
reputation, and results of operations.

**_A disruption in our equipment or information technology systems could adversely affect our operations._**

The timely development, implementation, and continuous and uninterrupted performance of our fueling equipment, payment
systems, business intelligence tools, hardware, network, applications, website and other systems, including those which may
be provided by third parties, are important factors in our delivery of products and services to customers. Our ability to protect
our equipment and systems against unexpected adverse events is a key factor in continuing to offer consumers our full range


-----

of products and services in an uninterrupted manner. Our equipment and systems are vulnerable to harm or interruption from
a variety of sources, many of which are not within our control, such as mechanical malfunction, power loss, internet and
telecommunications failures, software and hardware errors, failures, defects or crashes, computer viruses, malware and similar
disruptive problems, fire, flood and other natural disasters, attacks or security breaches carried out by hackers or criminals,
card fraud cases and problems with the performance of third-party suppliers. These and other related problems could result in
delays or disruptions in the supply and delivery of our products, problems maintaining or upgrading our equipment and systems,
customer dissatisfaction, harm to our reputation, fines and penalties or unanticipated capital expenditures or trade losses, each
of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Robbery, shop crime and fraud in our stores may adversely affect us._**

We have been the target of robberies, burglaries, theft, fraud, embezzlement by our employees and other forms of crime. For
example, in certain parts of our Fuel and Grocery & Merchandise operations, we have experienced relatively high level of store
thefts. Despite our efforts to reduce our exposure to such crimes, for instance through security guards or security cameras on
our sites, we expect to continue to be exposed to such crimes and new forms of crime. There can be no assurance that our
current or future efforts to counteract crimes will be effective or that the cost of such efforts will not increase. Further, any
crime we become victim of may give rise to litigation and related costs, including reputational costs and the costs linked to the
diversion of the attention from our management team from day-to-day operations of our business.

In addition, we could also face substantial losses due to the fraudulent use of third-party fuel cards that we accept at our sites.
A single significant incident of fraud, or increases in the overall level of fraud, involving these third-party fuel cards may be
sufficient to result in significant reputational damage to us or could lead to the imposition of regulatory sanctions. Our inability
to control and reduce robberies, whether intentional or not, burglaries, fraud, embezzlement or other forms of crime in a cost
effective manner could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Our operating results are subject to operational hazards and risks, and unfavorable or extreme conditions can adversely_**
**_impact our business._**

The demand for our Fuel, Grocery & Merchandise and Foodservice products is generally higher during the summer months
than during the winter months because of increased road traffic during that period. The reduced traffic linked to unfavorable
weather conditions during summer, including, for example, tornadoes, thunderstorms and flooding, could have a material
adverse impact on our sales and, therefore, on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition,
unfavorable weather conditions, for instance, snowstorms in the winter, may also negatively affect customer demand for our
products and prevent customers and suppliers from having access to our sites. Unfavorable weather conditions in the winter
could therefore also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further
unexpected and extreme conditions such as terrorist activities or political instability that are outside of our control could also
have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, we have approximately 5,937 sites across our network after giving effect to the Transactions. A significant portion
of our U.S. sites are located in the Northeastern and Midwestern parts of the United States, Gulf of Mexico and Florida. These
regions are particularly susceptible to severe weather conditions and severe storms, including hurricanes, thunderstorms,
extended periods of rain, ice storms and heavy snow, the quality and severity of which may be exacerbated due to climate
change. Additionally, a significant portion of our sites are located in European regions that have recently suffered from droughts
and heat waves. Such inclement weather conditions could damage our properties, affect the operations of our suppliers or could
have a significant impact on consumer behavior, travel and convenience retailer traffic patterns, as well as our ability to operate
our stores. We could also be affected by regional supply or distribution disruptions, such as energy shortages or increases in
energy prices, fires or other natural disasters. Besides these more obvious consequences of severe weather, our ability to insure
these locations and the related cost of such insurance may also affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We may also be directly or indirectly impacted by new or evolving public policies, civil defense plans, and emergency
management protocols implemented by federal, state, or local agencies designed to mitigate or adapt to the impacts of severe
weather or climate change.

As we store fuel in storage tanks (including underground storage tanks) at our PFS sites, our operations are subject to other
significant hazards and risks inherent in storing fuel, such as spills, discharges and other releases, mechanical equipment
failures, industrial accidents and explosions. Due to the often unexpected nature of these and other events, we might not be
able to adequately prepare or mitigate the damages and disruptions to our business that are linked to these events. These events
could disrupt or prevent us from performing functions at the corporate level, cause our fuel depots to get destroyed or damaged,
damage or destroy infrastructure at our sites, result in environmental pollution, cause personal injury or wrongful death claims,
subject us to governmentally imposed fines or cleanup obligations, disrupt our equipment or information technology, disrupt


-----

fuel supplies, increase fuel costs, decrease the value of our properties, affect national and regional economies and reduce footfall
at our sites. As a result, these events could make it difficult or impossible for us to operate our business and could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Further, the widespread outbreak of an illness including the COVID-19 pandemic or any other communicable disease, or any
other public health crisis, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Changes in general
economic and other impacts in response to such outbreak, including a decline in vehicle travel distance, whether self-imposed
or due to governmental or other authority, could materially impact financial results and may include temporary closure of
facilities, temporary or long-term restrictions on cross-border commerce and travel, greater currency volatility, and increased
risks to information technology systems, networks and digital services. Under these uncertain economic conditions, our
business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely effected.

**_We have recorded a significant amount of goodwill and we may never realize the full value thereof._**

We have recorded a significant amount of goodwill in relation to our acquisitions. This amount of goodwill on our balance
sheet may further increase in connection with acquisitions we complete in the future. Total goodwill, which represents the
excess of cost over the fair value of the net assets of businesses was $5,454 million as of June 30, 2023, after giving effect to
the Transactions, or 32% of our total assets. We test annually whether goodwill and property, plant and equipment have suffered
any impairment. Impairment may result from, among other things, deterioration in our performance, a decline in expected
future cash flows, adverse market conditions, adverse changes in applicable laws and regulations (including changes that restrict
our activities or affect the services we provide) and a variety of other factors. For instance, following an assessment of the
recoverability of goodwill carried out by the Group at year-end 2022, an impairment totaling $100 million was recognized in
relation to our Australian business, and a similar impairment of $100 million was also recognized for Australia in 2021.
Significant judgment is involved in estimating expected cash flows and fair value. Our estimates are based on historical and
projected operating performance, recent market transactions and current industry trading multiples. We may incur significant
impairment in the future, due in part to the expected decline in the importance of fossil fuels over the years and the risk of
obsolescence. Such charges may result in material reductions of our income and equity and could have a material adverse effect
on our results of operations and our ability to perform our obligations under the Notes.

**_We are subject to tax risks, in particular as a result of changes in tax law or its interpretation and application or as a result_**
**_of tax audits._**

Our business is subject to complex tax regimes in the jurisdictions in which we currently operate and, due to the large number
of such jurisdictions, is required to adopt complex tax planning initiatives. We are subject to changing tax laws and rates in the
countries in which we operate and such changes (including in relation to taxes or duties on fuel and excise and VAT, sales tax
or other taxes of a similar nature) and any misinterpretation of laws, unfavorable tax rulings against us or any kind of failure to
manage tax risks adequately could result in increased charges, financial loss, including penalties, and reputational damage. We
also cannot be sure that the rate of VAT sales taxes or other taxes of a similar nature in the countries in which we operate will
not increase in the future or be expanded to cover products and services not previously covered. (For example, VAT is not
currently chargeable in the United Kingdom on some food, or on books and newspapers.) If we are not able to pass increases
or expansions in VAT, sales taxes or other taxes on to our customers, or if our customers change their spending patterns as a
result of changes to VAT, sales taxes or other taxes, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations. Further, legislation has been enacted or is currently under consideration in a number of jurisdictions
to adopt and implement Pillar Two of the base erosion and profit shifting (“BEPS”) project initiated by the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”) to introduce to a global minimum tax rate of 15% for certain multinational
enterprises. In December 2021 and March 2022, the OECD published model rules and related commentary to support member
jurisdictions of the G20/OECD Inclusive Framework on BEPS (including the United Kingdom) to implement the Pillar Two
framework. For example, the United Kingdom has legislated to implement the Pillar Two income inclusion rule by introducing
a multinational top-up tax and the domestic top-up tax for certain large multinational enterprises for accounting periods
beginning on or after December 31, 2023. Changes related to Pillar Two, when enacted by the various jurisdictions in which
we do business, may increase our liability to taxes in those countries. As these changes are subject to implementation by each
member country, the timing and ultimate impact of any such changes on our tax obligations remains uncertain.

Further, our tax returns are subject to regular review and examination. We cannot guarantee that any tax audit or any related
tax dispute to which they may be subject in the future will result in a favorable outcome for us. There is a risk that any such tax
dispute could result in additional taxes becoming payable as well as negative publicity and reputational damage. In any such
case, substantial additional tax liabilities and ancillary charges could be imposed on us, which could increase our effective tax
rate and may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.


-----

In addition, our acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks, including in relation to changes in the tax laws to which
we are subject and, as a result, our inability to correctly assess the tax benefits and costs of any such acquisitions or investments
and of their integration into our complex multinational tax structure. Changes in tax laws or any unfavorable tax ruling by a
tax authority might also require us to revise our current or future tax structure and invest additional resources in order to
elaborate put in place a new and more efficient tax structure. We cannot predict the form or timing of potential legislative tax
changes or the outcome of any tax review by a tax authority, but any newly enacted tax law or an unfavorable tax ruling by a
tax authority could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We cannot assure you that the projections or assumptions used, estimates made or procedures followed in the Real Estate_**
**_Reports are correct, accurate or complete._**

This Offering Memorandum refers to the Real Estate Reports (as defined herein) with respect to freehold and long leasehold
properties of EG Group in the United States and Europe on the basis of the aggregate of the individual value of each freehold
and long leasehold property. The Real Estate Reports are intended to be an estimate of the market price of the underlying
properties, and are not a recommendation of the price to be offered or paid for a property. The Real Estate Reports do not
constitute a formal valuation compiled in accordance with RICS Valuation Global Standards or Uniform Standards of
Professional Appraisal Practice. As such there is a risk that property values indicated below diverge materially from the market
price of the underlying property or the indicative value that would be obtained if more comprehensive due diligence was
undertaken on the status and condition of each property. The financial information relating to each property that was used to
prepare the Real Estate Reports was provided to the Report Providers by us, and the Report Providers have not independently
verified and do not assume responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of any such information.

Opinions of pricing of property (including those used in the Real Estate Report) are prepared on the basis of various
assumptions, estimates and projections. In particular, the Real Estate Reports were produced without visual inspection of our
properties and is thus based on information provided by us and certain assumptions, including, but not limited to, the
assumptions that (i) our properties are not adversely affected by any existed or proposed environmental law, (ii) there are no
abnormalities as to repair and condition of the properties, (iii) properties are in compliance with planning and building control
regulations and we possess a good and marketable title free from any onerous restrictions or conditions, (iv) that all title, tenure,
lettings, taxation, statutory and local authority requirements are complied with, (v) assumptions around the rental value and
EBITDA generation potential of the properties and (vi) assumptions around market conditions and the availability of buyers.
For more information on the assumptions involved in and the methodology used for each report, see “Business—Real Estate
_Reports—Methodology, Assumptions and Basis of Broker’s Opinion of Pricing.” We cannot assure you that the assumptions_
or projections used, estimates made or procedures followed in the Real Estate Report are correct, accurate or complete. Actual
results may differ materially from the assumptions and projections used and estimates made in the Real Estate Report, for
example changes in the demand of our services, changes in the levels of referrals from local authorities, and changes in interest
rates may all impact the value of our real estate Portfolio.

In addition, during the course of their engagement, the Report Providers did not perform site inspections, environmental audit,
tests of services and amenities, investigations or tests as to the condition of the properties. The Report Providers did not make
planning or permitting inquiries and did not examine deeds, leases or other documents relating to the title to our properties.
The opinion of value included in each Real Estate Report was based on information that was reviewed by the relevant Report
Provider, including store specifications and certain historical operating information was provided by EG Group and its
affiliates. The information was not independently verified by the Report Providers and the Report Providers do not assume any
responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of any such information, including any financial or statistical information,
forecasts, or projections or undertake to update or revise their valuation analysis because of events, circumstances or data
coming to their attention occurring after the date of the relevant Real Estate Report.

The Real Estate Reports are addressed to EG Group only and each Report Provider has disclaimed any responsibility to any
third party for the whole or any part of the contents of their report and has consented to the information from their respective
report being included in this Offering Memorandum on a strictly non-reliance basis.

Other appraisers may reach different opinions on pricing of our property portfolio. Moreover, the pricing determined in the
Real Estate Reports could be significantly higher than the amount that would be obtained from the actual sale of the EG Group
property portfolio, especially in a distressed or liquidation scenario, in the event of a downturn in the local, regional or national
real estate market, or if the properties are sold on an individual basis. Accordingly, the Real Estate Report should not be
considered a representation of the actual present or future value of our property portfolio. In addition, we anticipate that the
appraised pricing of our property portfolio will change over time, and it may change materially.


-----

Any change in the factors underlying the valuation or the assumptions made in the Real Estate Reports could lead to a reduction
in the value of our real estate portfolio, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations.

**_We are subject to changes in property taxes._**

In the jurisdictions in which we operate, governments might centrally adjust the value of business rates in the property market.
For instance, in the United Kingdom, the government adjusts the value of business rates to reflect changes in the property
market approximately every five years. The most recent revaluation came into effect in England, Scotland and Wales on
April 1, 2023 (based on rateable values from April 1, 2021). At revaluation, all properties are given a new ratable value which,
depending on the underlying movement in the value of the property, can have a significant impact on the tax liability due on
the property. Adjustments of the business rates could result in increased costs and consequently could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**Risks Relating to Our Capital Structure**

**_Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or_**
**_results of operation and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations._**

We are, and following the issuance of the Notes, will continue to be, highly leveraged. As of June 30, 2023, after giving effect
to the Transactions and the application of the proceeds therefrom as described in “Use of Proceeds,” we would have had total
third-party debt of $5,525 million. While we have a Group-wide deleveraging strategy in place, our leverage may continue to
be high for the foreseeable future. Our high leverage could have significant consequences, including, but not limited to:

  - limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, business
opportunities and other corporate requirements;

  - increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse economic and industry
conditions;

  - requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of interest on
indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to fund the payment of principal of indebtedness,
working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, joint ventures or other general corporate purposes;

  - restricting us from pursuing strategic acquisitions or exploiting certain business opportunities;

  - limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the competitive environment and
the industry in which we operate;

  - placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are not as highly leveraged;

  - negatively impacting credit terms with our creditors; and

  - limiting our ability to borrow additional funds and increasing the cost of any such borrowing.

Any of these, or other, consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy our debt obligations
or a material adverse effect on the Issuer’s ability to satisfy its obligations under the Notes.

**_We may incur more debt in the future, which may make it difficult for us to service our debt, including the Notes, and impair_**
**_our ability to operate our businesses._**

We may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Although the Indenture will contain restrictions on the incurrence of
additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and under certain
circumstances the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial.
Some of this debt could rank pari passu with the Notes, be structurally senior to the Notes or be secured on assets which do
not form part of the Collateral for the Notes. Additional debt could also mature prior to the Notes. The agreements governing
our debt limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, but do not prohibit us from doing so. If new debt is added to the
Parent and its subsidiaries’ existing debt levels, the related risks that we currently face would increase. Furthermore, we may
incur additional indebtedness that bears interest at a variable rate plus an agreed margin and certain additional costs.
Fluctuations in such variable rate may increase our overall debt obligation and could have a material adverse effect on our


-----

ability to service our debt obligations, which in turn would have a material adverse effect on the ability of the Issuer to service
its obligations under the Notes. In addition, the Indenture will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute
indebtedness under it. Our inability to service our debt could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations and our ability to fulfil our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_The Issuer and certain of the Guarantors are holding companies that have no revenue-generating operations of their own_**
**_and will depend on cash from the operating companies of the Group to be able to make payments on the Notes and the_**
**_Guarantees._**

The Issuer and certain of the Guarantors are holding companies with no business operations or material assets other than the
equity interests they hold in their subsidiaries. The Issuer and certain of the Guarantors are dependent upon the cash flow from
their operating subsidiaries in the form of dividends or other distributions or payments to meet their obligations, including their
obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees. Given our international operations, the Issuer and certain of the Guarantors
have a large number of operating subsidiaries and business participations, which individually contribute to our results. The
amounts of dividends and distributions available to the Issuer and the Guarantors depend on the profitability and cash flows of
their subsidiaries and the ability of each of those subsidiaries to declare dividends under applicable law. These subsidiaries,
however, may not be able to, or may not be permitted under applicable law to, make distributions or advance upstream loans
to the Issuer and the Guarantors for payments in respect of their indebtedness, including the Notes and the Guarantees.

Various agreements governing our debt may restrict and, in some cases may actually prohibit, the ability of these subsidiaries
to move cash within their restricted group. Applicable tax laws may also subject such payments to further taxation. Applicable
laws may also limit the amounts that some of our subsidiaries will be permitted to pay as dividends or distributions on their
equity interests, or even prevent such payments. In particular, the ability of such subsidiaries to pay dividends will generally
be limited to the amount of distributable reserves available to each of them and the ability to pay its debt when due. The
subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes have no direct obligation to make payments with respect to the Notes or the
Guarantees.

While the Indenture limits the ability of the subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or
make other intercompany payments, these limitations are subject to significant qualifications and exceptions, including
exceptions for restrictions imposed by applicable law.

**_The Notes will be structurally subordinated to all liabilities of our existing and future subsidiaries that are not and do not_**
**_become Guarantors of the Notes._**

At the Issue Date, the Parent and certain subsidiaries of the Parent (subject to the Agreed Security Principles) will guarantee
the Notes. However, not all of the Parent’s subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes, and, under various circumstances, the
Guarantees may be released. Additionally, newly incorporated subsidiaries of the Parent may not be required to guarantee the
Notes and there are intermediate holding companies that are direct and indirect shareholders of the Guarantors that will not
provide a Guarantee. As of and for the six months ended June 30, 2023, and after giving pro forma effect to the Pre-Offering
Transactions, the non-Guarantor subsidiaries of the Parent, excluding any intercompany balances and transactions, accounted
for 21% of the pro forma consolidated total assets of the Group and 17% of Adjusted EBITDA Before IFRS 16 of the Group.

Unless a subsidiary of the Parent is a Guarantor, such subsidiary will not have any obligations to pay amounts due under the
respective series of Notes or to make funds available for that purpose. Generally, holders of indebtedness of, and trade creditors
of, non-Guarantor subsidiaries, including lenders under bank financing agreements, are entitled to payments of their claims
from the assets of such companies before these assets are made available for distribution to any Guarantor, as a direct or indirect
shareholder.

Accordingly, in the event that any non-Guarantor subsidiary becomes insolvent, is liquidated, reorganized or dissolved or is
otherwise wound up other than as part of a solvent transaction:

  - the creditors of the Issuer (including the holders of the Notes) and the Guarantors will have no right to proceed against
the assets of such subsidiary; and

  - creditors of such non-Guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors, will generally be entitled to payment in full from
the sale or other disposal of the assets of such company before any Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder, will
be entitled to receive any distributions from such subsidiary.

As such, the Notes and each Guarantee will be structurally subordinated to the creditors (including trade creditors) and any
preferred stockholders of any non-Guarantor subsidiaries.

**_We require a significant amount of cash to service our debt and sustain our operations. Our ability to generate sufficient_**
**_cash depends on many factors beyond our control._**

Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt, and to fund working capital, rental and lease payments and capital
expenditures, will depend on our future operating performance and ability to generate sufficient cash. This depends, to some
extent, on the success of our business strategy and on general economic, financial, competitive, market, legislative, regulatory
and other factors, as well as the other factors discussed in these “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum,
many of which are beyond our control. This also depends on our cash flow cycle, which experiences seasonal fluctuations.
Attendance levels at our forecourts are affected by the weather and travel patterns, among other factors, which could also have
a negative impact on our cash position and impact our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt and to fund
working capital and capital expenditures. If our interest payment dates coincide with periods of significant cash outflow, we
may have insufficient cash to pay our obligations as they come due.

We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations, that the currently anticipated cost
savings, revenue growth and operating improvements will be realized or that future debt and equity financing will be available
to us on satisfactory terms or in an amount sufficient to enable us to refinance all or a portion of our debt, pay our debts when
due, or to fund our other liquidity needs.

If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to
fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to:

  - reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditures;

  - sell assets;

  - obtain additional debt or equity capital; or

  - restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, on or before maturity.

We cannot assure you that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms,
if at all. In such event, the Issuer may not be able to meet its debt repayment obligations. In addition, the terms of our debt
limit, and any future debt may limit, our ability to pursue any of these alternatives. Any refinancing of our debt could be at
higher interest rates and could require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business,
financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that any assets which we could be required to dispose
of could be sold or that, if sold, the timing of such sale and the amount of proceeds realized from such sale would be acceptable.

Furthermore, our inability to meet payment obligations under our existing debt could trigger various default provisions,
accelerate a substantial portion (if not all) of our debt, and would materially affect our business, financial condition and results
of operations.

**_We are subject to significant restrictive debt covenants, which limit our operating and financial flexibility._**

The Indenture and the Existing Indentures contain covenants which impose significant operating and financial restrictions on
us. These agreements limit our ability to, among other things:

  - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred stock;

  - make certain restricted payments and investments;

  - transfer or sell assets or enter into sale and leaseback transactions;

  - enter into transactions with affiliates;

  - create or incur certain liens;

  - make certain loans, investments or acquisitions;

  - create or incur restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make other payments to us;


-----

  - take certain actions that would impair the security interests in the Collateral granted for the benefit of the holders of
the Notes; and

  - merge, consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of our assets.

These covenants could limit our ability to finance our future operations and capital needs and our ability to pursue acquisitions
and other business activities that may be in our interest.

**_Our failure to comply with the covenants under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, the Second Lien Credit Facilities_**
**_Agreement, the Existing Indentures or the Indenture, including as a result of events beyond our control, could result in an_**
**_event of default which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations._**

The Senior Credit Facilities Agreement and the Second Lien Credit Facilities Agreement require us to, among other things,
comply with certain financial ratios. Our ability to meet these financial requirements could be affected by deterioration in our
operating results, as well as by events beyond our control, including unfavorable economic conditions, and we cannot assure
you that we will be able to meet these tests in the future.

Moreover, a breach of any covenant in the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, the Second Lien Credit Facilities Agreement,
the Existing Indentures, the Indenture or the agreements governing any other debt that we may have outstanding from time to
time could result in a default under that respective agreement after any applicable grace period. If a default occurs, the holders
of the Existing Notes and the Notes and the lenders under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement and the Second Lien Credit
Facilities Agreement may elect to declare all such notes or borrowings, as applicable, together with accrued interest and other
fees, to be immediately due and payable. The lenders under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement and the Second Lien Credit
Facilities Agreement also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further
borrowings. If we are unable to repay our indebtedness when due or declared due, the lenders under the Senior Credit Facilities
Agreement and the Second Lien Credit Facilities Agreement and the holders of the Existing Notes and the Notes or of any
other secured indebtedness will also have the right to proceed against the collateral, including cash, granted to them to secure
such indebtedness. If the indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, the Second Lien Credit Facilities
Agreement, the Existing Indentures and the Indenture were to be accelerated, we cannot assure you that our assets would be
sufficient to repay such indebtedness, including the Notes, in full, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.

**_Hedging agreements may expose us to credit default risks and potential losses if our hedging counterparties fall into_**
**_bankruptcy._**

From time to time, we may enter into interest hedging or currency agreements to hedge our exposure to fluctuations in interest
rates, primarily under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, or foreign exchange rates. Under any such agreements, we would
be exposed to credit risks of our counterparties. If one or more of our counterparties falls into bankruptcy, claims we have
under the swap agreements or other hedging arrangements may become worthless. In addition, in the event that we refinance
our debt or otherwise terminate such hedging agreements, we may be required to make termination payments, which would
result in a loss. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and
_Capital Resources—Hedging.”_

**_Our ability to repay our debt depends on many factors beyond our control. If we are unable to raise capital in the future, we_**
**_may seek other avenues to fund the business, including sale/leaseback arrangements or seeking to sell assets of all, or a_**
**_portion of, our operations._**

Payments on our debt will depend on our ability to generate cash or secure additional financing in the future. This ability, to
an extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors beyond our control.
If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and sufficient future financing is not available to us, we
may not be able to repay our debt, operate our business or fund our other liquidity needs. If we cannot meet or refinance our
obligations when they become due, we may be required to attempt to raise capital, reduce expenditures, or take other actions
which we may be unable to successfully complete or, even if successful, could have a material adverse effect on us. If such
sources of capital are not available or not available on sufficiently favorable terms, we may seek other avenues to fund the
business, including sale/leaseback arrangements or seeking to sell assets of all or a portion of our operations. If we are unable
to raise capital, our ability to effectively operate our business could be impaired.

**Risks Related to the Notes**

**_No appraisals of any of the Collateral have been prepared by us or on our behalf in connection with the issuance of the_**
**_Notes. The Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Collateral that has been granted as security for the_**


-----

**_Notes and the Guarantees and such security may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations under the Notes and the_**
**_Guarantees._**

No appraisals of any of the Collateral have been prepared by us or on our behalf in connection with the issuance of the Notes.
There is no guarantee that the value of the Collateral will be sufficient to enable the Issuer to perform its obligations under the
Notes. There is no requirement to provide funds to enhance the value of the Collateral if it is insufficient. The proceeds of any
sale of the Collateral following an event of default with respect to the Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy, and may be
substantially less than, amounts due on the Notes. In addition, the Collateral will secure on a first-ranking basis our obligations
under the Senior Credit Facilities, the Existing Notes and certain hedging obligations, if any. Additionally, the Collateral may
also secure additional debt to the extent permitted by the terms of the Indenture, the Existing Indentures, the Senior Credit
Facilities Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement. The rights of holders of the Notes to the Collateral may be diluted by
any increase in the first-priority debt secured by the Collateral.

The amount of proceeds realized upon the enforcement of the security interests over the Collateral or in the event of liquidation
will depend upon many factors, including, among others, general market and economic conditions, the condition of the market
for the Collateral, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, the fair value of the Collateral, the availability of buyers,
the timing and manner of the sale, whether or not our business is sold as a going concern, the ability to readily liquidate the
Collateral, the availability of buyers and the condition of the Collateral, as applicable. Further, there may not be any buyer
willing and able to purchase our business as a going concern, or willing to buy a significant portion of its assets in the event of
an enforcement action.

The value of the Collateral may be subject to significant changes in value due to economic or regulatory trends. The book value
of the Collateral should not be relied on as a measure of realizable value for such assets. Portions of the Collateral may be
illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. In the event of a foreclosure, liquidation, bankruptcy or similar
proceeding, we cannot assure you that the proceeds from any sale or liquidation of this Collateral will be sufficient to pay our
obligations under the Notes. In addition, share pledges of an entity may be of no value if that entity is subject to an insolvency
or bankruptcy proceeding.

**_The Notes will be secured over substantially the same assets that secure the Senior Credit Facilities, the Existing Notes and_**
**_the Second Lien Credit Facilities, and will share in any enforcement proceeds on a pari passu basis with the Senior Credit_**
**_Facilities and the Existing Notes._**

The rights of the holders of the Notes with respect to the Collateral will be subject to the Intercreditor Agreement. Under the
Intercreditor Agreement, any enforcement action that may be taken with respect to the security will be undertaken by the
Security Agent. The Security Agent is required to take enforcement action upon receiving instructions from an instructing
group of holders of a majority of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of all our liabilities that qualify as senior liabilities
secured on a first-priority basis under the Intercreditor Agreement, which will include the Notes, the Existing Notes and
borrowings under the Senior Credit Facilities. The Collateral will also secure the Second Lien Credit Facilities on a junior basis
under the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Notes will be secured over substantially the same assets that secure the Senior Credit Facilities and the Existing Notes,
provided that, in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles, the Senior Credit Facilities and the Existing Murray Notes
are also secured by security interests over certain assets of EG Holdings (France) SAS and EG Retail (France) SAS, which do
not secure the Second Lien Credit Facilities, the Existing Cirrus Notes or the Notes. While the Intercreditor Agreement includes
an equalization provision relating to the Notes, the Senior Credit Facilities and Existing Notes, the enforceability of this
equalization provision is uncertain. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Non-Distressed Disposals—
_Equalization.”_

The Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, the Second Lien Credit Facilities Agreement, the Existing Indentures and the Indenture
permit us to issue additional notes or other indebtedness that will share in the Collateral. If we issue additional notes or procure
additional senior indebtedness secured on a first-priority basis in the future which, taken together with the Existing Notes and
outstanding borrowings under the Senior Credit Facilities, represents a majority of the aggregate outstanding principal amount
of all our liabilities that qualify as senior liabilities under the Intercreditor Agreement, the holders of such other senior
indebtedness may acquire the right to direct the Security Agent to take enforcement action ahead of the holders of the Notes.

As a result of the voting provisions set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement, certain amendments, waivers and other actions
under the Intercreditor Agreement and in relation to the Collateral will require consent from the required majority of holders
of the Notes, the required majority of holders of any _pari passu senior secured indebtedness (including the creditors of the_
Senior Credit Facilities and the Existing Notes), the required majority of “super senior creditors” in respect of any indebtedness
which is permitted to be secured on a super senior basis under the Intercreditor Agreement and, in certain circumstances, the


-----

required majority of holders of any junior indebtedness. The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent will
serve in respect of the Collateral for the secured parties under the Intercreditor Agreement and will act with respect to the
Collateral only at the direction of the relevant “instructing group” and in accordance with the enforcement principles set out
therein.

As of the Issue Date, the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Senior Credit Facilities and the Existing Notes is
significantly greater than the aggregate principal amount of the Notes, corresponding to higher voting power within the relevant
instructing group of creditors of the Senior Credit Facilities and the Existing Notes compared to holders of the Notes.
Furthermore, to the extent we incur additional indebtedness that is secured on a _pari passu_ basis with the Notes (such as
additional indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement or the Existing Indentures), the voting interest of holders
of the Notes in the relevant instructing group will be diluted commensurate with the amount of such indebtedness we incur.

**_The security provided does not attach to substantially all assets of the Australian Guarantors, which may restrict the ability_**
**_to enforce that security during the decision period under section 441A of the Australian Corporations Act._**

If the security provided does not attach to all or substantially all of the assets of the Australian company, there is a risk at
Australian law that the secured creditor may be restricted in its ability to enforce that security by appointing a receiver during
the decision period under section 441A of the Australian Corporations Act. Each general security deed granted by the Australian
Guarantors provides for customary exclusions of certain assets from the scope of that security, and if sufficient assets of the
Australian Guarantors are subject to these exclusions, there may be a risk that the security provided does not attach to
substantially all assets of the Australian Guarantors, which may restrict the ability to enforce that security during the decision
period under section 441A of the Australian Corporations Act.

**_It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral securing the Notes._**

The Collateral securing the Notes will be subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens, security interests and
other imperfections permitted under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement and accepted by other creditors that have the
benefit of first-priority security interests in the Collateral securing the Notes, from time to time, whether on or after the date
the Notes are first issued, including lenders under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement and holders of the Existing Notes.
The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens, security interests and other imperfections could adversely
affect the value of the Collateral securing the Notes, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such
Collateral. Furthermore, the priority ranking of security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among
others, the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, or statutory liens.

**_Rights of holders of Notes in the Collateral may be materially adversely affected by the failure to create or perfect security_**
**_interests in the Collateral on a timely basis or being junior security interests._**

Under applicable law, a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets may only be properly perfected, and even if
properly perfected may only attain its intended priority, through certain actions undertaken by the secured party and/or the
grantor of the security, such as registration with a relevant court or other authority or notification of a third party, or taking
possession or control of the relevant Collateral or the entry into a subordination agreement with any third party that has a prior
ranking security interest in the relevant Collateral. The security interests on the assets securing the Notes may not be perfected
with respect to the claims of the Notes, or even if properly perfected may not attain a first ranking priority, if we or the Security
Agent, fail or are unable to take the actions required to perfect any of these security interests or to attain that first ranking
priority. Any hardening period under insolvency law with respect to the Collateral will not commence until such security has
been perfected. The Security Agent will have no obligation to perfect or take actions required to perfect any of the security
interests, or to attain a first ranking priority.

There can be no assurance that the Security Agent will monitor, or the Trustee, or that we or any security provider will inform
the Security Agent or the Trustee, and that the necessary actions will be taken to properly create, perfect and re-perfect the
security interest in any future assets and or rights or to preserve the security interest over time. Such failure may adversely
affect the enforceability of such security interest and/or the priority of such security interest in favor of third parties, including
a receiver in insolvency proceedings and other creditors who have a claim in the same security interest.

In addition, depending on the jurisdiction of the relevant security documents and the location of the Collateral, the security
interests of the Noteholders in respect of the Collateral owned by certain members of the Group may be considered to be junior
to the security interests granted under the Senior Credit Facilities, the Existing Notes and the Second Lien Credit Facilities.
The Intercreditor Agreement provides that such junior security interests will be deemed and treated as security interests ranking
_pari passu_ with the security interests securing the Senior Credit Facilities. If the Intercreditor Agreement or the relevant
provisions thereof were voided or held to be unenforceable for any reason, holders may not benefit from such first-priority


-----

treatment and may be subordinated, with respect to such security interests, to senior security interests over the same Collateral
securing other indebtedness of the Parent, the Issuer and the restricted subsidiaries, which may result in greater risk and loss of
principal.

**_The granting of the security interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes, or the incurrence of permitted debt in_**
**_the future, may create or restart hardening periods._**

The granting of the security interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes, or the incurrence of permitted debt in the
future, may create or restart hardening periods, which are the periods of time following the granting of security interests during
which such security interests may be challenged in accordance with relevant laws.

The granting of security interests to secure the Notes and the Guarantees may create hardening periods for such security interests
in certain jurisdictions. The granting of shared security interests (including the security interests in the Collateral), including in
connection with any release and retake of such security interests, to secure existing, new or future indebtedness permitted to be
secured on the Collateral may restart or reopen such hardening periods in particular, because the Indenture permits the release
and retaking of security granted in favor of the relevant Notes in certain circumstances, including in connection with the
incurrence of future indebtedness. The applicable hardening period for these new security interests can run from the moment
each new security interest has been granted, perfected, amended, shared or recreated (as applicable). At each time, if the security
interest granted or recreated were to be enforced before the end of the respective hardening period applicable in such
jurisdiction, it may be declared void or ineffective and/or it may not be possible to enforce it.

**_Noteholders’ ability to enforce certain rights in connection with any Guarantee, or security interest in the Collateral, granted_**
**_by a Guarantor that is incorporated under the laws of Australia may be limited or affected by Australian insolvency_**
**_legislation relating to “ipso facto” rights._**

Under the Australian Corporations Act, rights under a contract, agreement or arrangement (such as a right entitling a creditor
to terminate a contract or to accelerate a payment under a contract) arising merely because a company, among other specified
circumstances, is under administration, has appointed a managing controller or is the subject of an application under section 411
of the Australian Corporations Act or because of its financial position during such proceedings (i.e., “ipso facto rights”), will
generally not be enforceable during a prescribed moratorium period. The specified circumstances do not include a winding up
or liquidation.

These laws apply to ipso facto rights arising in respect of companies incorporated under the laws of Australia (which relevantly
would include a Relevant Australian Company) under contracts, agreements or arrangements entered into at or after July 1,
2018, subject to certain exclusions specified in the Australian Corporations Regulations.

The Australian Corporations Regulations provide that a contract, agreement or arrangement that is, or governs, securities,
financial products, bonds or promissory notes will be exempt from the moratorium. Furthermore, a contract, agreement or
arrangement that is, or is directly connected with, a securities financing transaction is also excluded from the moratorium.
Accordingly, the Australian Corporations Regulations should exclude from the stay those Guarantees and security interests in
the Collateral that are granted by Relevant Australian Companies. However, as the relevant provisions of the Australian
Corporations Act and the Australian Corporations Regulations are relatively new to the insolvency regime in Australia, they
have not been the subject of extensive judicial interpretation and there remains some uncertainty as to the scope of the
application of the exclusion to guarantees or securities granted by a Relevant Australian Company, given that the relevant
contract, agreement or arrangement must be “directly connected” with a securities financing transaction. If the Australian
Corporations Regulations are determined not to exclude those Guarantees and security interests in the Collateral that are granted
by Relevant Australian Companies, this may render unenforceable in Australia any provisions of those Guarantees and security
interests that are granted to Relevant Australian Companies, conditioned solely on the occurrence of events giving rise to ipso
facto rights. Investors should seek independent advice on the implications (if any) of these laws and regulations on their
investment in the Notes.

**_The Collateral is subject to casualty risks and potential environmental liabilities._**

We intend to maintain insurance or otherwise insure against hazards in a manner appropriate and customary for our business.
There are, however, certain losses that may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable, in whole or in part. Insurance
proceeds may not compensate us fully for our losses. If there is a complete or partial loss of any of the pledged Collateral, the
insurance proceeds may not be sufficient to satisfy all of the secured obligations, including the Notes and the Guarantees.

In addition, even if there is sufficient insurance coverage, there may be significant delays in obtaining the insurance proceeds
or replacement Collateral. As a result, if we incur an event that damages or destroys certain Collateral, it could reduce the


-----

aggregate value of the Collateral, which could reduce the amounts payable to you from the proceeds of any sale of the Collateral
in the case of an enforcement of the liens securing the Notes.

Moreover, the Security Agent may need to evaluate the impact of potential liabilities before determining to foreclose on
Collateral consisting of real property because owners and operators of real property may be held liable under environmental
laws for the costs of remediating or preventing the release or threatened release of hazardous substances at such real property,
and the property itself could become subject to a lien, under environmental laws for the costs of remediating or preventing the
release or threatened release of hazardous substances at such real property. Consequently, the Security Agent may decline to
foreclose on such Collateral or exercise remedies available in respect thereof if it does not receive indemnification to its
satisfaction from the holders of the Notes.

**_Enforcing your rights as a holder of the Notes or under the Guarantees or in the Collateral across multiple jurisdictions_**
**_may be difficult._**

The Notes will be issued by the Issuer, which is incorporated under the laws of England and Wales and will be guaranteed by
certain subsidiaries that are incorporated under the laws of Australia, Belgium, England and Wales, Germany, Italy, the
Netherlands and the U.S. states of California, Delaware, Pennsylvania, Wyoming, Vermont, Massachusetts and Virginia.
Security interests to secure the Notes and guarantees will be granted in collateral located in certain of these jurisdictions. In the
event of bankruptcy, insolvency or a similar event, proceedings could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions or in the
jurisdiction of organization of a future Guarantor. Your rights under the Notes, the Collateral and the Guarantees will therefore
be subject to the laws of multiple jurisdictions, and you may not be able to enforce effectively your rights in multiple
bankruptcy, insolvency and other similar proceedings. Moreover, such multi-jurisdictional proceedings are typically complex
and costly for creditors and often result in substantial uncertainty and delay in the enforcement of creditors’ rights.

In addition, the bankruptcy, insolvency, foreign exchange, administration and other laws of the various jurisdictions may be
materially different from or in conflict with one another and those of the United States, including in respect of creditors’ rights,
priority of creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration of the insolvency proceeding. The consequences
of the multiple jurisdictions involved could trigger disputes over which jurisdiction’s law should apply which could adversely
affect your ability to enforce your rights and to collect payment in full under the Notes and the Guarantees. In addition, certain
jurisdictions may impose limitations on the ability of foreign creditors to enforce security interests, including, for example,
requiring registration or approval under foreign ownership regulations. The laws of certain of the jurisdictions in which the
Guarantors are incorporated or organized further limit the ability of these subsidiaries to guarantee debt of, or provide security
for, other companies.

**_The security over the Collateral will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes and the concept of “trust” is not a_**
**_recognized concept in certain jurisdictions._**

The security interests in the Collateral that will secure the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Notes and the
Guarantees, respectively, will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes but will be granted only in favor of the Security
Agent for the Notes and to the Security Agent for the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, the Existing Notes and the Second
Lien Credit Facilities Agreement. The Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in
favor of the Security Agent mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors (as principal obligors) towards the holders
of the Notes under or in connection with the Indenture. The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that only the Security Agent
has the right to enforce the Security Documents. As a consequence, the holders of the Notes will not be entitled to take
enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Trustee for the Notes, who will provide
instructions to the Security Agent in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement. Holders of the Notes will also bear some
risks associated with a possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent as the beneficiary of the parallel debt.

There can be no assurances that such a “parallel debt” structure will be recognized and effective in all cases. There is some
uncertainty under the laws of certain jurisdictions, such as Italy, as to whether obligations to beneficial owners of the Notes
that are not identified as registered holders in, nor are directly parties to, a security document will be validly secured and/or can
be enforced; this area of law is untested in the courts of certain jurisdictions. There can be no assurances that such a parallel
debt structure will be recognized and effective in all cases in all relevant jurisdictions and several of the relevant jurisdictions
do not provide for the parallel debt construct and such structures have not been tested in the relevant courts and it cannot be
excluded that a court might not hold up the parallel debt construct and that parallel debt provisions would not be applicable.
See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and _Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the_
_Security Interests.” To the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created for the benefit of the Security Agent as_
parallel debt creditor under the parallel debt construction are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will
not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests in the Collateral.


-----

To the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created for the benefit of the Security Agent are successfully challenged
by other parties, holders of the Notes could not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of the
security interests in the Collateral. In addition, the holders of the Notes may bear risks associated with the possible insolvency
or bankruptcy of the Security Agent.

**_Holders of the Notes will not control certain decisions regarding the Collateral and the sale of particular assets could reduce_**
**_the pool of assets securing the Notes._**

The Security Documents will, subject to the terms of the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, the Second Lien Credit Facilities
Agreement, the Existing Indentures and the Indenture, allow the Issuer and the Guarantors to remain in possession of, retain
control over, freely operate, and collect, invest and dispose of any income from the Collateral. So long as no acceleration event
under the Indenture is occurring or would result therefrom, the Issuer and the Guarantors, may, among other things, without
any consent by the Security Agent, conduct ordinary course activities with respect to the Collateral, such as selling, factoring
or otherwise disposing of Collateral and making ordinary course cash payments, including repayments of indebtedness. Any
of these activities could reduce the value of the Collateral and consequently the amounts payable to holders of the Notes from
the proceeds of any sale of the Collateral in the case of an enforcement.

**_If the Revolving Credit Facilities are designated as super senior liabilities in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor_**
**_Agreement, creditors under the Revolving Credit Facilities and counterparties to certain hedging obligations and other_**
**_indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement ranking pari passu_**
**_with the Revolving Credit Facilities are entitled to be repaid with proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral in priority_**
**_over the Notes._**

The Intercreditor Agreement includes provisions governing the sharing of proceeds from enforcement of the Collateral. Such
enforcement proceeds are required to be turned over to the Security Agent after certain events, including the acceleration of
the Notes. The Security Agent is required to apply turned-over amounts and other recoveries by the Security Agent from
enforcement actions toward discharging the super senior obligations (including, among others, (following the designation of
the Revolving Credit Facilities as super senior liabilities in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement) those
under the Revolving Credit Facilities, certain hedging obligations and other indebtedness that may be secured on a super senior
basis (the “Super Senior Liabilities”)) in priority to applying any such amounts toward discharging the Notes. As such, in the
event of a foreclosure of the Collateral, you may not benefit from such recoveries if the then outstanding claims under such
Super Senior Liabilities are greater than the proceeds recovered. Any proceeds remaining from an enforcement sale of
Collateral will, after all obligations under such Super Senior Liabilities have been discharged, be applied pro rata in repayment
of the Senior Credit Facilities (other than the Senior Credit Facilities constituting Super Senior Liabilities), the Existing Notes,
the Notes, and any other indebtedness that ranks pari passu with the Notes. Furthermore, claims of our secured creditors that
are secured by assets that do not also secure the Notes will have priority with respect to such assets over the claims of holders
of the Notes. As such, the claims of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes will be effectively subordinated to the rights of
such secured creditors to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness.

**_We may not be able to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control._**

The Indenture will contain provisions relating to certain events constituting a “Change of Control” as defined in the Indenture.
Upon the occurrence of such events (subject to certain exceptions), we will be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding
Notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to
the date of repurchase. If a change of control event were to occur, we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient funds
available at such time, or that we would have sufficient funds to provide to the Issuer to pay the purchase price of the outstanding
Notes or that the restrictions in the Intercreditor Agreement or our other than existing contractual obligations would allow us
to make such required repurchases. A change of control may result in an event of default under, or acceleration of, our other
indebtedness. The repurchase of the Notes pursuant to such an offer could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the
change of control itself does not. If an event constituting a change of control event occurs at a time when the Group is prohibited
from providing funds to the Issuer for the purpose of repurchasing the Notes, we may seek the consent of the lenders under
such indebtedness or may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If such a consent to repay such
borrowings is not obtained, the Issuer will remain prohibited from repurchasing any Notes. In addition, we expect that we
would require third-party financing to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control. We cannot assure you
that the Group would be able to obtain such financing.

**_Holders of the Notes may have adverse tax consequences in the event of an IPO Pushdown or in certain other circumstances._**

Under certain circumstances, we may undertake an IPO Pushdown (as described in “Description of the Notes—IPO
_Pushdown”), pursuant to which the Parent is entitled to give notice that the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor_


-----

Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (as defined in “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—
_Additional Intercreditor Agreements”)) will automatically operate so that, among other things, the references to the Parent and_
Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in “Description of the Notes—Certain Definitions”) (and all related provisions) shall apply
only to the IPO Pushdown Entity (as defined in “Description of the Notes—IPO Pushdown”) and its Restricted Subsidiaries.
In such event, each holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity would be released from its obligations under the Indenture
governing the Notes. In addition, in certain circumstances some or all of the Guarantees by the Guarantors could be released
and terminated, as described further under “Description of the Notes—Notes Guarantees Release.”

In either case, such a modification to the terms of the Notes could be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a deemed
exchange of (i) the Notes as in place prior to such modifications for (ii) new Notes as in place after such modifications (“New
Notes”). If such modifications resulted in a deemed exchange, such a deemed exchange could be treated as a taxable transaction
for U.S. federal income tax purposes in which beneficial owners of the Notes could be required to recognize gain or loss.
Furthermore, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the New Notes deemed issued in such a deemed exchange could be treated
as issued with original issue discount. In such event, U.S. Holders (as defined under “Certain Taxation Considerations—
_Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations”) would be required to include the original issue discount in their income as_
it accrues, in advance of the receipt of cash corresponding to such income. In addition, the determination of whether the New
Notes are treated as “contingent payment debt instruments” as a result of the possibility of additional payments, as further
described under “Certain Taxation Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations—Characterization of
_the Notes,” would be made at the time of the modification. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors as to the U.S._
federal income tax considerations relating to modification of the Notes in connection with the IPO Pushdown or other
circumstances in which Guarantees could be released and terminated.

**_Our current and future variable interest rate debt may be impacted by applicable regulation and may bear interest that could_**
**_rise significantly, thereby increasing our costs and reducing our cash flow._**

Substantially all of our debt (other than the Notes and the Existing Notes) bears interest at a variable rate, and we have been
and will continue to be exposed to the risk of fluctuations in interest rates. These interest rates have risen significantly more
recently and could continue to rise significantly in the future, increasing our interest expense associated with these obligations,
reducing cash flow available for capital expenditures and hindering our ability to make payments on the Notes. Although we
have entered into and maintained certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these rates, there can be no assurance
that hedging will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms. Hedging itself carries certain risks, including that
we may need to pay a significant amount (including costs) to terminate any hedging arrangements. To the extent interest rates
continue to rise significantly, our interest expense would correspondingly continue to increase, thus reducing cash flow.

In addition, any elimination of any applicable benchmark, or changes in the manner of administration of such benchmark, could
require an adjustment to the terms and conditions of our floating rate debt. Any such consequence could have a material adverse
effect on the value of and return on any such floating rate debt. If any applicable benchmark was discontinued or otherwise
unavailable, the rate of interest on our floating rate debt will be determined for the relevant period by the fallback provisions
applicable to such debt.

**_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Collateral securing the Notes and_**
**_the Guarantees will be released automatically and under which the Guarantees will be released automatically, without your_**
**_consent or any action on the part of the Trustee._**

Under various circumstances, the Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees will be released automatically, including,
among others, the following:

  - in connection with any sale or other disposition of Collateral not prohibited under the Indenture;

  - with respect to Collateral owned by a Guarantor, upon the release of such Guarantor from its Guarantee as described
under “Description of the Notes—Notes Guarantees—Notes Guarantees Release”;

  - with respect to any Collateral, upon the release or discharge of the Security Interests granted over such Collateral in
favor of the Lenders under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, the Second Lien Credit Facilities Agreement, any
Credit Facilities that refinance or replace any amounts outstanding under such facilities or any successor facilities
thereof except a release as a result of repayment of any such facilities (other than pursuant to a refinancing in which
the refinancing indebtedness does not benefit from any security in such Collateral); provided that the security interests
over such Collateral granted in favor of the holders of any outstanding Existing Notes are also released or discharged


-----

at such time (or will be released or discharged substantially concurrently with the release or discharge of the security
interest over such Collateral granted in favor of the Holders of the Notes); or

  - if such property or other asset is or becomes an asset excluded from the grant of Security Interests pursuant to any
Security Document.

The Indenture will also permit us to designate certain of our Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries. See “Description of the
_Notes—Certain Covenants—Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries.” If we designate a Guarantor as an_
Unrestricted Subsidiary for purposes of the Indenture, the Security Interests in respect of the Collateral owned by such
Subsidiary or any of its Subsidiaries and any Guarantees provided by such Subsidiary or any of its Subsidiaries will terminate
and be released under the Indenture, but not necessarily under our Credit Facilities. Designation of an Unrestricted Subsidiary
will reduce the aggregate value of the Collateral securing the Notes to the extent that liens on the assets of the Unrestricted
Subsidiary and its Subsidiaries are released. Any of these events will reduce the aggregate value of the Collateral securing the
Notes.

In addition, under various circumstances, the Guarantees will be released automatically, including while any obligations under
the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, the Second Lien Credit Facilities Agreement, or any Credit Facilities that refinance or
replace any amounts outstanding under such facilities or any successor facilities thereof remain outstanding, the Guarantee of
a Guarantor may terminate and be released without action by, or consent of, the holders of the Notes, the Trustee or the Security
Agent under the Indenture if such Guarantor is no longer a guarantor of the obligations under the Credit Facilities and the
Existing Notes, subject to certain exceptions. See “Description of the Notes—Notes Guarantees—Notes Guarantees Release.”
Upon the closing of a direct or indirect disposal of a Guarantor to a Person which is not a member of the Group, or other
transaction pursuant to which that Guarantor will cease to be a member of the Group and which, in each case, is not prohibited
by the terms of the applicable Credit Facility, the obligations of such Guarantor under the applicable Credit Facility will, subject
to the satisfaction of certain conditions, be discharged and released. In addition, if any shares of a Guarantor are subject to
certain permitted interest transfers under the Credit Facilities, including transfers of such shares in connection with permitted
joint ventures or similar arrangements, or a Guarantor otherwise ceases to be a wholly owned subsidiary of another member of
the Group, the guarantee of such Guarantor under the applicable Credit Facility may automatically terminate and be released.
The lenders under our Credit Facilities will have the discretion to release the guarantees under our Credit Facilities in a variety
of other circumstances. The Indenture will also permit the Guarantee of a Guarantor to terminate and be released without action
by, or consent of, any holder of the notes in certain other circumstances as described under “Description of the Notes—Notes
_Guarantees—Notes Guarantees Release.” You will not have a claim as a creditor against any Subsidiary that is no longer a_
Guarantor, and the Indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables, whether secured or unsecured, of those
Subsidiaries will effectively be senior to claims of noteholders.

See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of the Notes.”

**_The Notes and the Guarantees will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws_**
**_or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability._**

Generally, a court could subordinate or void the Notes or the Guarantees under various corporate purpose or benefit, fraudulent
conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, insolvency or bankruptcy challenges, financial assistance, preservation of share
capital, thin capitalization, capital maintenance or similar laws or regulations affecting the rights of creditors generally if, at
the time the Notes were issued or one of the Guarantors entered into a Guarantee:

  - the amount paid or payable under the relevant Guarantee was in excess of the maximum amount permitted under
applicable law;

  - the relevant Guarantee or security interest was incurred with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors or
shareholders of the Guarantor or, in certain jurisdictions, even when the recipient was simply aware that the Guarantor
was insolvent when it granted the relevant Guarantee or security interest;

  - the Guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for granting the relevant
Guarantee/security interests and the Guarantor was: (i) insolvent or rendered insolvent because of the relevant
Guarantee/security interest; (ii) undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the relevant Guarantee; or
(iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity; and/or

  - the relevant Guarantees were held to exceed the corporate objects of the Guarantor or not to be in the best interests or
for the corporate benefit of the Guarantor or security provider.


-----

The Issuer is incorporated under the laws of England and Wales and the Guarantors and security providers, as applicable, are
incorporated under the laws of Australia, Belgium, England and Wales, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands and the States of
California, Delaware, Pennsylvania, Wyoming, Vermont, Massachusetts and Virginia. Applicable fraudulent transfer and
conveyance and insolvency laws, equitable principles and, limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in courts in
such jurisdictions, could limit the enforceability of the relevant Guarantee against a Guarantor or the enforceability of the
security interests in the Collateral subject to such other regulations. If a court were to void a Guarantee, you would no longer
have a claim against the Guarantor or the benefit of any security interest provided thereby. Sufficient funds to repay the Notes
may not be available from other sources, including the remaining Guarantors, if any. In addition, the court might direct you to
repay any amounts that you already received from the Guarantor. Furthermore, particular jurisdictions differ in respect of other
applicable laws that could impact the enforceability of a Guarantee and the Collateral (or the extent of such Guarantee or
Collateral), such as laws concerning insolvency and insolvent transactions, financial assistance, preservation of share capital,
thin capitalization, corporate purpose or benefit, voidable preference, unfair loans, unreasonable director-related transactions,
defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally or other similar laws. See “—The security over the Collateral will not be
_granted directly to the holders of the Notes and the concept of ‘trust’ is not a recognized concept in certain jurisdictions” and_
“Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security
_Interests.”_

**_Investors may not be able to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities law violations._**

The Issuer and certain of the Guarantors and their respective subsidiaries are organized outside the United States. In addition,
the majority of the directors and executive officers of the Issuer and the other Guarantors are not residents of the United States.
Although the Issuer and all of the Guarantors will submit to the jurisdiction of certain New York courts in connection with any
action under U.S. securities laws under the Indenture, you may be unable to effect service of process within the United States
on the directors and executive officers of the Issuer and the Guarantors. In addition, because many of the assets of the Issuer
and the Guarantors and their directors and executive officers are located outside of the United States, you may be unable to
enforce against them judgments obtained in the U.S. courts.

**_The insolvency laws of certain jurisdictions may provide you with less protection than U.S. bankruptcy law._**

The Issuer is incorporated under the laws of England and Wales and the Guarantors and security providers, as applicable, are
incorporated under the laws of Australia, Belgium, England and Wales, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and the States of
California, Delaware, Pennsylvania, Wyoming, Vermont, Massachusetts and Virginia. Any insolvency proceedings by or
against the Issuer or Guarantors incorporated or organized in jurisdictions outside of the United States would likely be based
on the insolvency laws of the jurisdiction of incorporation of the relevant entity and not of the United States. In the event the
Issuer or any of the other Guarantors experience financial difficulty no prediction can be made as to which jurisdiction or
jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced or as to the outcome of such proceedings. Any
enforcement of the Guarantees after bankruptcy or an insolvency event in such other jurisdictions will be subject to the
insolvency laws of the relevant entity’s jurisdiction of incorporation or other jurisdictions. The insolvency and other laws of
each of these jurisdictions may not be as favorable to your interests as creditors as the laws of the United States or other
jurisdictions with which you may be familiar. The insolvency and other laws of each of these jurisdictions may be materially
different from, or in conflict with, each other, including in the areas of rights of secured and other creditors, the ability to void
preferential transfer, priority of governmental and other creditors, ability to obtain post-petition interest and duration of the
proceeding. The application of these laws, or any conflict among them, could call into question whether any particular
jurisdiction’s laws should apply and may adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the Guarantees in these
jurisdictions and limit any amounts that you may receive.

**_There is no established trading market for the Notes and you may not be able to sell the Notes readily or at all or at or above_**
**_the price that you paid, and there can be no assurance that an active trading market will develop._**

The Notes are a new issue of securities and there is no established trading market for them, and we cannot assure you that an
active trading market will develop for the Notes or be maintained. We expect the Notes to be eligible for trading by “qualified
institutional buyers” as defined under Rule 144A, and to persons that are “not U.S. persons” outside of the United States as
defined under Regulation S.

Future trading prices for the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things, prevailing interest rates, our
operating results and the market for similar securities. Historically, the market for non-investment grade securities has been
subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. The liquidity of a
trading market for the Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities and is subject
to disruptions that may cause volatility in prices. The trading market for the Notes may attract different investors and this may


-----

affect the extent to which the Notes may trade. It is possible that the market for the Notes will be subject to disruptions. Any
such disruption may have a negative effect on you, as a holder of the Notes, regardless of our prospects and financial
performance. As a result, there is no assurance that there will be an active trading market for the Notes. If no active trading
market develops, you may not be able to resell your holding of the Notes at a fair value, if at all.

Although an application will be made to the Authority for the listing of and permission to deal in the Notes on the Exchange,
there can be no assurance that the Notes will be listed on the Official List of the Exchange, that such permission to deal in the
Notes will be granted or that such listing will be maintained. Although no assurance is made as to the liquidity of the Notes as
a result of the admission to list on the Official List of the Exchange, failure to be approved for listing or the delisting (whether
or not for an alternative admission to listing on another stock exchange) of the Notes from the Exchange may have a material
effect on a holder’s ability to resell the relevant Notes, as applicable, in the secondary market.

Certain of the Initial Purchasers of the Notes have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes, but they are not
obligated to do so and may discontinue any market making in the Notes at any time without notice. You may not be able to sell
your Notes at a particular time or at favorable prices. As a result, we cannot assure you as to the liquidity of any trading market
for the Notes. Accordingly, you may be required to bear the financial risk of your investment in the Notes indefinitely. If a
trading market were to develop, future trading prices of the Notes may be volatile and will depend on many factors, including:

  - changes in the overall market for securities similar to the Notes;

  - changes in our financial performance or prospects;

  - the prospects for companies in our industry generally;

  - the number of holders of the Notes;

  - the interest of securities dealers in making a market for the Notes; and

  - prevailing interest rates.

Any decline in trading prices, regardless of the cause, may adversely affect the liquidity and trading market for the Notes. In
addition, the Indenture will allow us to issue additional notes in the future which could adversely impact the liquidity of the
Notes issued hereby. In such cases, holders of the Notes may not be able to sell the Notes at a particular time or at a favorable
price.

**_Investors may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Notes._**

The Dollar Notes will be denominated and payable in U.S. dollars and the Euro Notes will be denominated and payable in euro.
If investors measure their investment returns by reference to a currency other than U.S. dollars or euro, an investment in the
Notes will entail foreign exchange-related risks due to, among other factors, possible significant changes in the value of the
U.S. dollar or euro relative to the currency by reference to which such investors measure the return on their investments,
including as a result of exchange controls imposed in relation to such currencies by the authorities with jurisdiction over those
currencies. These changes may be due to economic, political and other factors over which we have no control. Depreciation of
the U.S. dollar or euro against the currency by reference to which such investors measure the return on their investments could
cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to investors when
the return on the Notes is translated into the currency by reference to which such investors measure the return on their
investments. Investments in the Euro Notes by U.S. investors may also have important tax consequences as a result of foreign
exchange gains or losses, if any. Foreign exchange and losses relating to the Notes may also have tax consequences for investors
in other jurisdictions. See in particular “Certain Tax Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations” and
“Certain Tax Considerations—Certain United Kingdom Taxation Considerations.”

**_Investors in the Notes may have limited recourse against our independent auditor._**

In respect of the audit reports relating to the annual financial statements included in this Offering Memorandum, KPMG’s
reports, in accordance with guidance issued by The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, include the
following limitations: “This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part
16 of the Companies Act. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters
we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do
not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.”


-----

Investors in the Notes should understand that these statements are intended to disclaim any liability to parties (such as
purchasers of the Notes) other than to the Parent with respect to those reports. The SEC would not permit such limiting language
to be included in a registration statement or a prospectus used in connection with an offering of securities registered under the
U.S. Securities Act, or in a report filed under the U.S. Exchange Act. If a U.S. court (or any other court) were to give effect to
the language quoted above, the recourse that investors in the Notes may have against the independent auditors based on their
reports or the consolidated financial statements to which they relate could be limited. The extent to which auditors have
responsibility or liability to third parties is unclear under the laws of many jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom, and
the legal effect of these statements in the audit reports is untested in the context of an offering of securities. The inclusion of
the language referred to above, however, may limit the ability of holders of the Notes to bring any action against our auditors
for damages arising out of an investment in the Notes.

**_The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form and therefore investors must rely on the procedures of the relevant_**
**_clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

The Notes will initially only be issued in global registered form and held through DTC (with respect to the Dollar Notes) and
Euroclear and Clearstream (with respect to the Euro Notes). Interests in the global notes will trade in book-entry form only,
and Notes in definitive registered form will be issued in exchange for book-entry interests only in very limited circumstances.
Owners of book-entry interests will not be considered owners or holders of Notes. The nominee for DTC will be the sole
registered holder of the global notes representing the Dollar Notes and the common depositary, or its nominee, for Euroclear
and Clearstream will be the sole registered holder of the global notes representing the Euro Notes. Payments of principal,
interest and other amounts owing on or in respect of the global notes representing the Notes will be made to the relevant paying
agent, which will make payments to DTC or Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable. Thereafter, these payments will be
credited to participants’ accounts that hold book-entry interests in the global notes representing the Notes and credited by such
participants to indirect participants. After payment to the nominee for DTC and the common depositary for Euroclear and
Clearstream, as applicable, none of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent or the Registrar will have any
responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the owners of book-entry interests.
Accordingly, if investors own a book-entry interest, they must rely on the procedures of DTC or Euroclear and Clearstream, as
applicable, and if investors are not participants in DTC or Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, they must rely on the
procedures of the participant through which they own their interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of Notes
under the Indenture.

Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right to act upon the Issuer’s
solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes. Instead, if an investor owns a bookentry interest, it will be permitted to act only to the extent it has received appropriate proxies to do so from DTC or Euroclear
and Clearstream, as applicable. The procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies may not be sufficient to enable
such investor to vote on a timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture, unless and until Definitive Registered Notes (as
defined herein) are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if investors own book-entry interests, they will be restricted to
acting through DTC or Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable. The procedures to be implemented through DTC or Euroclear
and Clearstream, as applicable, may not be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of rights under the Notes.

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may be subject to revision,_**
**_suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

The credit ratings address our ability to perform our obligations under the terms of the Notes and credit risks in determining
the likelihood that payments will be made when due under the Notes. The ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all
risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed above and other factors that may affect the value of the
Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or
withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No assurance can be given that a credit rating will remain constant for any given
period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its judgment,
circumstances in the future so warrant. A suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the
Notes by one or more of the credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost and terms and conditions of our financings and
could adversely affect the value and trading of the Notes. In addition, if any of our other outstanding debt is rated and
subsequently downgraded, raising capital could become more difficult, borrowing costs under our credit facilities and other
future borrowings may increase and the market price of the Notes may decrease. Any credit rating downgrade affecting us
could materially adversely affect our ability to finance our ongoing operations and to refinance our indebtedness. The effects
of a downgrade include increased borrowing costs (for new and existing indebtedness), which could adversely affect our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_The Intercreditor Agreement requires that noteholders respond to requests for consent or details of its participation within_**
**_a certain period of time in order to be deemed to have participated in respect of the relevant matter._**

The Intercreditor Agreement includes provisions governing voting procedures for classes of creditors, including the
noteholders. If in relation to a request for a consent, to participate in a vote of a class of creditors, to approve any action or to
provide any confirmation or notification, in each case, under the Intercreditor Agreement or the Indenture, any creditor fails to
respond to the request within a specified number of business days or fails to provide details of its credit participation to the
Security Agent within a specified time, such creditor will be disregarded or be deemed to have zero participation in respect of
the matter or be deemed to have provided the relevant confirmation or notification, as applicable, provided that this provision
shall not apply to any noteholder in respect of a request where such noteholder is not given the option to respond to such request
in the negative. As such, any noteholder who does not wish to vote in favor of a request for a consent, but does not submit a
negative vote through the relevant voting system, will not have such noteholder’s preference counted.

**_A series of Notes may be issued with original issue discount (“OID”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes._**

A series of Notes may be issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In that event, U.S. investors generally will be
required to include OID in gross income (as ordinary income) on an annual basis under a constant yield accrual method,
regardless of their regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, U.S. investors will generally
include any OID in income in advance of the receipt of cash attributable to such income. For more information, see “Certain
_Taxation Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations.”_

**_The Italian Golden Power legislation may restrict our ability to pursue certain transactions or restrict the ability of investors_**
**_to acquire a significant stake in our share capital._**

EG Italia may be subject to the Italian Golden Power Legislation, pursuant to which the Italian Golden Power Authority can,
among others, prohibit or impose restrictions, conditions and undertakings on: (i) the acquisition of shareholdings in companies
holding assets and contractual relationships in sectors qualified as strategic (notably, defense and national security, energy,
transport, communications, healthcare, agri-food and financial, amongst others), and (ii) resolutions, acts or transactions
approved by companies holding assets and contractual relationships in strategic sectors and resulting in a change in ownership,
control, possession of such strategic assets or relationships or in the use or purpose thereof, including the enforcement and,
according to a prudential interpretation, the granting or extension of securities over the shares and strategic assets of the said
companies.

In particular, acquisitions of controlling interests by individuals or entities belonging to the European Union (including Italy)
and acquisitions of interests by persons or entities not belonging to the European Union that entail the direct or indirect
acquisition of at least 10% of the voting rights or share capital (provided that the value of investments is at least €1 million)
must be reported to the Italian Golden Power Authority for the possible exercise of the veto right or the application of
restrictions, conditions and undertakings; acquisitions that exceed the 15%, 20%, 25% and 50% of the voting rights or share
capital thresholds are also subject to the reporting obligation.

Acquisitions of controlling interests by individuals or entities belonging to the European Union are subject to the Italian Golden
Power Legislation only if related to companies holding assets and relationships in the communications energy, transport,
healthcare, agri-food and financial sectors. In the defense and national security sector, the relevant threshold is more than 3%
of the voting rights or share capital for both European Union and non-European Union investors (it does not apply only to
acquisitions by Italian public authorities or entities controlled by such authorities). Resolutions, acts or transactions approved
by a company holding assets and relationships in strategic sectors that give rise to changes in the ownership, control or
possession of such assets, or in the use or purpose thereof, including the enforcement and, according to a prudential
interpretation, the granting or extension of securities over the shares or strategic assets must also be reported within ten days,
and in any case prior to their implementation, to the Italian Golden Power Authority.

As a result, our ability to pursue commercial or industrial strategic resolutions, acts or transactions that involve, inter alia, the
direct or indirect acquisition of, or the subscription for, the shares of EG Italia may be impacted by the exercise by the Italian
Golden Power Authority of its powers under the Italian Golden Power Legislation. On a more general note, if EG Italia is
involved, directly or indirectly, in any transaction, act or resolution falling in the scope of the Italian Golden Power Legislation,
the Italian Golden Power Authority may veto or impose conditions to consent to the implementation of such transaction, act or
resolution, which may be material. Accordingly, we may not be permitted to undertake such transaction, act or resolution in a
timely fashion, without remedies or undertakings, or at all.

Therefore, the Italian Golden Power Legislation could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations,
financial condition or prospects. Furthermore, our shareholders’ ability to enter into change of control or takeover transactions


-----

relating to shareholdings in our share capital may be impacted by the exercise by the Italian Golden Power Authority of its
powers under the Italian Golden Power Legislation. Our shareholders may not be able to transfer their interests or such a
transfer may be subject to conditions, which diminish the value of the transaction. Failure to comply with the reporting
obligation provided under the Italian Golden Power Legislation or with any veto or undertakings imposed by the Italian Golden
Power Authority may result in the relevant transaction, act or resolution being unwound or declared null and void, and in the
perpetrators being subject to material monetary fines.

**_The enforcement and, according to a prudential interpretation, the granting/extension of the pledge over the shares of EG_**
**_Italia will require clearance under the Italian Golden Power Legislation._**

EG Italia may be subject to the Italian Golden Power Legislation, pursuant to which the Italian Golden Power Authority can,
among others, prohibit or impose restrictions, conditions and undertakings on: (i) the acquisition of shareholdings in companies
holding assets and contractual relationships in sectors qualified as strategic (notably, defense and national security, energy,
transport, communications, healthcare, agri-food and financial, amongst others), and (ii) resolutions, acts or transactions
approved by companies holding assets and contractual relationships in strategic sectors and resulting in a change in ownership,
control, possession of such strategic assets or relationships or in the use or purpose thereof, including the enforcement and,
according to a prudential interpretation, the granting and/or extension of securities over the shares and strategic assets of the
said companies.

As soon as reasonably practicable and no later than 10 business days following the Issue Date, we will submit an application
with the Italian Golden Power Authority pursuant to the Italian Golden Power Legislation in order for the Italian Law Share
Pledge to be extended as security for the Notes and Guarantees. It cannot be excluded that the Italian Golden Power Authority
may impose restrictions, conditions and undertakings or, theoretically, prohibit the extension of the Italian Law Share Pledge.
Furthermore, to the extent an enforcement of the Italian Law Share Pledge would result in the acquisition of a material equity
interest in EG Italia or any other resolution, act of transaction included in the scope of the Italian Golden Power Legislation,
any such enforcement would require clearance under the Italian Golden Power Legislation. It cannot be excluded that the Italian
Golden Power Authority may impose restrictions, conditions and undertakings or, theoretically, prohibit the enforcement of
the Italian Law Share Pledge.

**THE TRANSACTIONS**

**The Transactions**

On or around the Issue Date, we intend to enter into committed financing in respect of additional senior term loan facilities
comprising (i) a term facility in a principal amount of €          (the “Tranche E Facility B (EUR)”) and (ii) a term facility
in a principal amount of $          (the “Tranche E Facility B (USD)”, together with Tranche E Facility B (EUR), the
“Tranche E Term Facilities” and each a “Tranche E Term Facility”) provided for under our existing Senior Credit Facilities
Agreement. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Senior Credit Facilities Agreement.”

On or about the Issue Date, we will use the gross proceeds from the Offering and the Tranche E Term Facilities to (i) redeem
the Existing Notes and (iii) pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Offering Transactions. The Offering, the
Tranche E Term Facilities and such use of proceeds therefrom, collectively, are referred to as the “Offering Transactions”. The
Offering Transactions, the UK Disposal to Asda, the Amend and Extend, the U.S. Sale and Leaseback (as defined herein), the
Non-Core Asset Disposals and the application of the proceeds therefrom, collectively, are referred to as the “Transactions”.
The UK Disposal to Asda, the Amend and Extend, the U.S. Sale and Leaseback, the Non-Core Asset Disposals and the
application of the proceeds therefrom (excluding from the Non-Core Minit Mart Disposal (Kentucky and Tennessee)) to repay
certain indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facilities and Existing Notes and pay related fees and expenses, collectively, are
referred to as the “Pre-Offering Transactions”.

**_Non-Core Minit Mart Disposal (Kentucky and Tennessee)_**

The Non-Core Minit Mart Disposal (Kentucky and Tennessee) refers to the sale of 65 of our convenience retail locations in
Kentucky and Tennessee, which operate under the Minit Mart and Certified Oil banners. As of November 3, 2023, we had
completed the sale of 55 of these sites in a sale to Casey’s General Stores, Inc. for gross consideration of $101.4 million and
net proceeds of $84.4 million. The C-Store site numbers presented in this Offering Memorandum, when adjusted for the
Transactions or the Pre-Offering Transactions, are adjusted for the sale of 63 sites, which include the 55 sites we have sold as
of November 3, 2023 and an additional eight sites which are held for sale and for which we are actively looking for a buyer.
We will continue to evaluate our strategic options in relation to the remaining two sites.

**Non-Core Minit Mart Disposal (Missouri and Kansas)**

In April 2023, we completed the Non-Core Minit Mart Disposal, consisting of 26 non-core company operated Minit Mart
locations in Missouri and Kansas with net proceeds of $43 million.

**Sale and Leaseback Transaction**

**_Post-Closing Obligations_**

Following the consummation of the sale-leaseback transaction, EG America, LLC remained obligated for a period of twelve
(12) months from the date of the applicable Master Lease to use commercially reasonable efforts, at its sole cost and expense,
to resolve various non-material diligence items at certain of the properties. The resolution of those diligence items included
obtaining easements, combining tax parcels, and obtaining certain Phase II environmental studies (and performing any required
remediation obligations in connection therewith).

**_Material Master Lease Terms_**

_Term_

The initial term of the Master Leases vary between eighteen (18) and twenty-two (22) years, with an average initial term of
twenty (20) years. In addition, each Master Lease contains eight (8) extensions of five (5) years each, which must be exercised
with respect to no less than fifty percent (50%) of the properties described in each such Master Lease. The applicable extension
term automatically renews unless EG America, LLC or its affiliate, as tenant, provides written notice, no later than six (6)
months prior to the expiration of the then current term, setting forth the property or properties for which the Master Lease will
not be extended.

_Rent_

The Master Leases are “triple net”, which require EG America, LLC or its affiliate to make monthly installments of the annual
rent payments in addition to paying all costs, expenses and obligations arising thereunder with respect to the properties and all
improvements and appurtenances related thereto.

_Guarantor_

The obligations of EG America, LLC or its affiliate as tenant under each Master Lease are unconditionally guaranteed by EG
America, LLC and the Parent, as guarantors (collectively, the “Master Lease Guarantors”). Pursuant to each guaranty, in certain
instances whereby an event of default is occurring under a Master Lease, any indebtedness of EG America, LLC or its affiliate
party to the respective Master Lease and held by the Master Lease Guarantors, is subordinated to the right of payment to the
obligations under the Master Lease secured by that certain guaranty.

_Maintenance, Alterations and Expansion_

Pursuant to the Master Leases, EG America, LLC or its affiliate, as tenant, is obligated to repair, rebuild, replace and maintain
each property. EG America, LLC or its affiliate may make structural and non-structural alterations to the properties or construct
one or more new buildings or additional structures or expand the existing improvements; provided, however, consent by Realty
Income is required if it is anticipated that such structural alterations or contemplated expansions would materially decrease the
value, building footprint or functionality of such property.

_Right of First Refusal_

In the event that Realty Income, as landlord, desires to directly or indirectly transfer any property to a third party, it shall first
offer EG America, LLC or its affiliates, party to such Master Lease, the right to purchase such property. The right of first offer
is conditioned upon (i) no event of default then occurring under the subject Master Lease and (ii) is personal to the original
tenant thereunder.

_Assignment and Subletting_

The Master Leases contain broad assignment and subletting rights in favor of EG America, LLC or its affiliate party thereto.
However, EG America, LLC or its affiliate, as tenant, must provide at least thirty (30) days’ prior written notice in connection
with a transfer, change of control of the tenant or guarantor, or a material sublease (a sublease of eighty percent (80%) or more
of the properties). Further, EG America, LLC or its affiliate, as tenant, must obtain the consent of Realty Income, as landlord,
in the event of an assignment of less than all of the properties constituting the premises under each such Master Lease in
connection with any direct assignment of the Master Lease by EG America, LLC or its affiliate party thereto.

_Events of Default_

The Master Leases contain a customary event of default provision, which events of default include: (i) the failure of EG
America, LLC or its affiliate, as tenant, to pay any amounts due and owing under the Master Lease or to perform any non

-----

monetary obligation required to be performed by the tenant within the applicable notice and cure period (if such non-monetary
failure results in a material adverse effect on such property or properties); (ii) a default by the guarantor under the guaranty
beyond the applicable notice and cure period; (iii) a transfer of the Master Lease in violation of the terms set forth therein which
is not cured within the applicable notice and cure period; and (iv) the bankruptcy of tenant or guarantor, including a general
assignment for the benefit of creditors, the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or a liquidation or dissolution thereof.

_Terminations due to Casualty and Condemnation_

Pursuant to the Master Leases, EG America, LLC or its affiliate party thereto, as tenant, may only terminate the Master Lease
with respect to the effected property in the event that: (i) following a casualty during the least year of the term, the buildings
with respect to a property are damaged twenty-five percent (25%) or more of their insurable value, tenant’s access to the
property is impaired and the property is therefore rendered unfit for ordinary use, or tenant’s operations at the property are
significantly impaired for more than ninety (90) days; (ii) all or substantially all of any property is taken by eminent domain;
(iii) during the last year of the term, a temporary taking occurs with respect to any property; or (iv) following a partial
condemnation, the continued operation of tenant’s business is no longer commercially advantageous, the parking is reduced by
fifteen percent (15%) or more, reasonable access to the property is frustrated, or the appropriation has a material adverse effect
on tenant’s use of the property.

**_Investment in MDC Obsidian, LLC_**

Pursuant to the SLB Purchase Agreement, Cumberland Farms, Inc., an affiliate of EG America, LLC acquired an interest in
MDC Obsidian, LLC (“Obsidian”) pursuant to that Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of Obsidian,

Cumberland Farms, Inc. as of the date of the Obsidian Agreement was equal to $39,156,212.92.

_Additional Capital Contributions – If Obsidian requires additional equity capital prior to the expiration of the Tax Protection_
Period, the Investor Member has a pre-emptive right (but no obligation) to fund its pro rata share of any such equity capital
required.

_Distributions – pro rata to the Members in proportion to their respective Percentage Interests (as set forth above)._

_Management – Obsidian is managed by the Realty Income Member as the managing member who is vested with the exclusive_
right to manage Obsidian.

_Transfers of Interests – Transfers of interests by either Member are permitted subject to (A) such transfers not being made to_
prohibited persons or in a manner which would violate applicable laws, and (B) delivery to the other member of the executed
instrument of transfer and an express assumption of the obligations of the transferring member (which for a transfer by Realty
Income Member requires delivery to Investor Member of an express assumption of the obligations under the Tax Protection
Agreement (as defined below)).

_Right of First Offer – Investor Member is entitled to a right of first offer on the sale of Realty Income Member’s interest in_
Obsidian or a sale of Obsidian if the same occurs prior to the earlier of May 16, 2035 or a Buyout Trigger Event (a “Buyout
Trigger Event” means the earliest to occur of the following: (i) any of the events set forth in clauses (i), (ii) or (iv) of the
definition of “Tax Protection Period,” as described below, and (ii) the event set forth in clause (iii) of such definition occurs
with respect to all of the EG Contributed Properties).


-----

_Drag Right – Subject to Investor Member’s right of first offer, in the event the Realty Income Member approves a sale of_
Obsidian, the Realty Income Member has the ability to cause the Investor Member to sell its interest in Obsidian in connection
with such sale of Obsidian.

_Put/Call Rights –_

  - At any time during the period commencing on the date of a sale or other disposition in which all or any portion of
Investor Member’s built-in gain with respect to the properties contributed (or deemed contributed) to Obsidian by
Investor Member (the “EG Contributed Properties”) is recognized for U.S. federal income tax purposes and ending
on the date that is 60 days after the earlier of (i) the date that managing member notifies Investor Member in writing
that such sale or other disposition has occurred or (ii) the date on which Investor Member otherwise becomes aware
of such sale or other disposition, Investor Member shall have the right, but not the obligation, to require Realty Income
Member to purchase (either itself or through one or more designees) from Investor Member all (but not less than all)
of Investor Member’s interest in Obsidian, free and clear of all liens, for a purchase price equal to the fair market value
of such interest.

  - At any time from and after the earlier to occur of (i) May 16, 2043, or (ii) a Buyout Trigger Event, Realty Income
Member shall have the right, but not the obligation, to require Investor Member to sell to Realty Income Member all
(but not less than all) of Investor Member’s interest in Obsidian, free and clear of all liens, for a purchase price equal
to the fair market value of such interest.

_Tax Protection Agreement –_

  - In connection with the contribution (or deemed contribution) of the EG Contributed Properties, Obsidian, Investor
Member, and Realty Income Corporation (“RI”) entered into a customary tax protection agreement (the “Tax
Protection Agreement”) pursuant to which, among other things, Obsidian and RI agreed to indemnify Investor
Member in the event that certain transactions cause Investor Member to recognize all or a portion of certain gain
deferred by Investor Member in connection with such contributions.

  - In general, the indemnification under the Tax Protection Agreement is triggered by Obsidian’s sale or other taxable
disposition of the EG Contributed Properties, certain transactions causing a taxable disposition of Investor Member’s
interest in Obsidian, or Obsidian’s failure to maintain and permit Investor Member to guarantee certain indebtedness,
in each case generally during the Tax Protection Period (as defined below).

“Tax Protection Period” means the period commencing on the May 15, 2023 and expiring on the date that is the earliest of (i)
May 15, 2030, (ii) the date of a final determination under the internal revenue code that no portion of the contribution of the
EG Contributed Properties qualified for tax-deferred treatment, (iii) the date on which Obsidian terminates any Master Lease
due to the default thereunder by an affiliate of the Investor Member, (iv) the date on which the affiliate of the Investor Member
ceases to be the tenant under such Master Lease and neither of the Master Lease Guarantors (or any of their creditworthy wholly
owned subsidiaries) is a guarantor under such Master Lease guarantee, (v) the date on which the Investor Member has
transferred to a party unrelated to Investor Member more than 50% of the original ownership interests in the Obsidian (for the
avoidance of doubt, not taking into account any dilution from the issuance of new equity interests in Obsidian or any redemption
of Investor Member’s interests by Obsidian or any indirect transfers), or (vi) upon filing for bankruptcy by the Investor Member
or any of its relevant affiliates; provided that with respect to the events in clause (iv), the Tax Protection Period shall terminate
only with respect to the applicable properties (and not other EG Contributed Properties).

_Phase I and Phase II Loans and Guaranties –_

Obsidian is an obligor under two loans made by RI, the first in the amount of $585,483,963.43 (“Phase I Loan”) and the second
in the amount of $589,468,725.59 (“Phase II Loan”; and together with the Phase I Loan, the “Loans”), each of which accrues
interest at the rate of 6.87% per annum and matures on May 16, 2030. Interest on each of the Loans is payable on the first day
of each month in arrears. Each of the Loans is prepayable at any time without premium or penalty. Obsidian, pursuant to the
terms of each Loan, is prohibited from making distributions to its equity holders that would cause the outstanding balance of
either Loan to exceed 60% of Obsidian’s assets (net of any debts which are senior or pari passu to the applicable Loan). The
payment obligations under each of the Loans are guaranteed, jointly and severally, by the Investor Member, the Parent and EG
America, LLC.

**Senior Credit Facilities Amend and Extend**

In the second quarter of 2023, we launched an amend and extend of our Senior Credit Facilities (the “Amend and Extend”),
concurrently with the announcement of a significant deleveraging program.

The Amend and Extend addressed our upcoming $6.1 billion senior secured term loan maturities through an extension of the
maturity date to February 2028. Consenting lenders agreed to (i) extend $3.2 billion of multi-currency senior secured term
loans through a combination of the redesignation of existing facilities to new facilities with the extended maturity and newmoney commitments (the “Extended Senior Secured Term Loan Facilities”), (ii) certain amendments which took effect once
the Consent Letters were countersigned, and (iii) other amendments which will take effect following the occurrence of the
Condition Satisfaction Date (the “Conditional Amendments”). Following the occurrence of the Condition Satisfaction Date,
upon which certain consents received in the Amend and Extend and not already in effect will become operative and following
the designated term loan repayments from the Pre-Offering Transactions, we expect that approximately $300 million in
aggregate principal amount of existing term loans carrying a 2025 and 2026 maturity will remain outstanding. As part of the
Amend and Extend, we also secured an extension to the maturity date of the majority of our existing Revolving Credit Facilities
and Letter of Credit Facilities to August 31, 2027. The remaining portion of our existing senior secured term loans will be
repaid in full with proceeds from the UK Disposal to Asda, the U.S. Sale and Leaseback and/or the Non-Core Minit Mart
Disposal (Missouri and Kansas). In connection with the Amend and Extend and the utilization of Tranche D Term Facilities,
we will pay certain fees, OID, costs and expenses totaling $170 million.

The Amend and Extend successfully allocated on June 30, 2023 and the Extended Senior Secured Term Loan Facilities and
Conditional Amendments will be become operative upon the occurrence of the Conditions Satisfaction Date following the
closing of the UK Disposal to Asda. If the Conditions Satisfaction Date does not occur by December 31, 2023, none of the
maturity extensions secured in the Amend and Extend nor any of the Conditional Amendments will be implemented and certain
of the redesignation of existing facilities to new facilities to facilitate the extended maturity and new-money commitments of
the Extended Senior Secured Term Loan Facilities will be unwound. For a further description of the Amend and Extend and
our revised Senior Credit Facilities, Revolving Credit Facilities and Letter of Credit Facilities, see “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements— Senior Credit Facilities Agreement.”_

**The UK Disposal to Asda**

**_The UK Disposal to Asda_**

On May 30, 2023, we announced our binding agreement to sell a substantial majority of our Fuel, Foodservice and Grocery
and Merchandise business in the United Kingdom to Asda, for an initial consideration of £2.27 billion, subject to various
adjustments and agreement upon a precise transaction perimeter. Following discussions between Asda and the Group on the
perimeter of the UK Disposal to Asda and discussions with the relevant brand partners, Asda and the Group agreed that the
Starbucks Business and KFC Business in the United Kingdom and Ireland, together with their employees, would not transfer
to Asda as part of the UK Disposal to Asda and would, therefore, form part of the Retained UK&I Business immediately
following Completion. As a result of these discussions, the UK Disposal to Asda was completed on October 31, 2023 for total
cash consideration of £2 billion ($2.5 billion).

The UK Disposal to Asda is a transformational step for us. The proceeds from the UK Disposal to Asda, along with the proceeds
from the U.S. Sale and Leaseback and the Non-Core Minit Mart Disposal (Missouri and Kansas), will be used to repay certain
of our term loan facilities and Existing Notes, as described in _“Summary—Recent Developments—Senior Credit Facilities_
_Amend and Extend” and to redeem a portion of our Existing Notes. See “Capitalization”._

The UK Disposal to Asda, along with the U.S. Sale and Leaseback, is the cornerstone of our strategy to reduce total net leverage,
extend our financing maturities and reposition our capital structure for future business growth and financial resilience.
Following the UK Disposal to Asda, we will continue to operate and maximize long-term growth opportunities in the United
States, Australia, Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Belgium, and will continue to consider our
strategic options in the Retained UK&I Business.

The perimeter and financial metrics of the Disposed UK Business are not identical to our business division in the United
Kingdom and Ireland. As presented in our historical financial accounts and in this Offering Memorandum, our United Kingdom
and Ireland business division’s results of operations and KPIs include the Retained UK&I Business and do not reflect any
deduction for shared service center costs attributable to such operations. However, when adjusting our consolidated financial
KPIs for the Pre-Offering Transactions or the Transactions in this Offering Memorandum, including for the purposes of
calculating Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, we have specifically removed amounts attributable to the Disposed UK Business,
as well as for the Non-Core Asset Disposals, and have given pro forma effect to the U.S. Sale and Leaseback.


-----

Following the UK Disposal to Asda, we will continue to operate our Retained UK&I Business, which will consist of (i) the
electric vehicle charging business, ‘evpoint’; (ii) non-transferring head office staff; (iii) certain brands and intellectual property
(including ‘EG’, ‘Euro Garages’, ‘Vapexchange’ and ‘Hyperform’); (iv) the Cooplands business; (v) the franchise businesses
carried on under the Starbucks brand and the KFC brand; (vi) the franchise businesses carried on under the Chaiiwala brand
and the Cinnabon brand; (vii) the Euro Grocer business; (viii) 31 operational petrol filling stations and a cluster of Foodservice
outlets in the United Kingdom that were not sold as part of the UK Disposal to Asda; (ix) two additional petrol filing stations
in the United Kingdom that were acquired subsequent to our agreement with Asda relating to the UK Disposal to Asda; and
(x) undeveloped land bank assets. Subject to the performance by the parties of certain customary closing obligations, the
transaction was completed on October 31, 2023. For a description of the key terms of the UK Disposal to Asda, see “—Sale
_and Purchase Agreement” and see “Recent Developments” for a description of the other strategic disposals currently under_
consideration in relation to the Retained UK&I Business.

**_Sale and Purchase Agreement_**

The UK Disposal to Asda was structured as the sale of the entire issued share capital of Euro Garages (Jersey) Limited (the
“Target”, and together with the Target’s subsidiaries, the “Target Group”) to Asda. The asset base of the Target Group consists
of 356 PFS and Grocery & Merchandise sites and 444 Foodservice outlets, including the LEON brand and all relevant
employees who devote more than half their time to the transferring business. EG Group retained its businesses in the United
States, Europe (other than the Disposed UK Business) and Australia, and the following, which were carved out from the Target
Group: (i) our electric vehicle charging business, ‘evpoint’; (ii) non-transferring head office staff; (iii) certain brands and
intellectual property (including ‘EG’, ‘Euro Garages’, ‘Vapexchange’ and ‘Hyperform’); (iv) the Cooplands business; (v) the
franchise businesses carried on under the Starbucks brand and the KFC brand; (vi) the franchise business carried on under the
Chaiiwala brand and the Cinnabon brand; (vii) the Euro Grocer business; (viii) 31 operational petrol filling stations and a cluster
of Foodservice outlets in the United Kingdom; and (ix) undeveloped land bank assets.

The UK Disposal to Asda was documented by way of a sale and purchase agreement between EG Finco Limited (the “Seller”),
Project America Bidco Limited (the “Purchaser”) and Bellis Acquisition Company 3 Limited (as guarantor for the Purchaser)
(as such agreement may be supplemented or amended from time to time, the “Sale and Purchase Agreement”). The Seller and
the Purchaser (or their affiliated companies) also entered into certain ancillary agreements on completion of the UK Disposal
to Asda (“Completion” and the date of Completion, the “Completion Date”) (and are expected to enter into certain other
ancillary agreements following Completion) in each case in relation to certain transitional services, integration and branding
arrangements, certain property matters and the EV charging business, the key terms of which are described further in “—
_Ancillary Agreements”._

The Sale and Purchase Agreement provided that, in the period prior to Completion, the Seller and the Purchaser would agree
to the terms of a carve-out transaction such that the Seller (and certain members of the Group) would (together) retain the
Retained UK&I Business that was formerly held by the Target Group. Under the Sale and Purchase Agreement, the purchase
price, which was paid in cash on Completion, was £2 billion (following the application of estimated net debt and working
capital adjustments). Following Completion, the parties will agree on any post-completion adjustments to account for any
differences between, respectively, a target net working capital position and an estimate of the net debt position of the Target
Group and the actual net working capital position and actual net debt position of the Target Group on the Completion Date.
Following the post-completion adjustments referred to above, the parties do not anticipate this process to result in any material
adjustments.

The Seller provided customary fundamental warranties, business warranties and indemnities (including a tax covenant) under
the Sale and Purchase Agreement. The Purchaser has purchased W&I insurance for the UK Disposal to Asda to provide
insurance recourse in the event of a breach of the majority of the business warranties or claims under the tax covenant. For
matters not covered by W&I insurance (including certain business warranties not covered by the W&I insurance and
indemnities), the Purchaser may seek direct recourse to the Seller. The Seller’s liability for a breach of business warranties is
capped at 10% of consideration. All claims under the Sale and Purchase Agreement are subject to (with certain exceptions)
customary contractual time and other limitations and an aggregate cap of the consideration.

The Sale and Purchase Agreement provides that any dispute arising out of the Sale and Purchase Agreement shall be referred
to the London Court of Arbitration.

**_Ancillary Agreements_**

On the Completion Date, we entered into a transitional services agreement with the Target Group pursuant to which we agreed
to continue to provide access to all centralized shared services (such as IT, HR, accounting, payroll, compliance and tax
functions), that were, in the 12 months prior to Completion, provided to the Target Group by us (“Centralized Services”), for


-----

a transitional period (the “TSA”). The initial term of the TSA is expected to be a period of up to two years from the Completion
Date, subject to certain rights for the Target Group to terminate, or transition away from, services early or to extend the initial
term for an aggregate period of up to a further 12 months (in 3 months increments). During the term of the TSA, we will also
provide certain of the IT services that will continue to be provided to the Target Group to Asda, for the benefit of certain other
convenience retail sites that Asda and its affiliates own from time to time, including those branded as ‘ASDA Express’. The
services provided by us to the Target Group will be deemed to be subject to a service credit for the first two years of the TSA,
as a result of which the Target Group will not be required to make any payment to us for the services (subject to certain limited
exceptions) and thereafter will be provided for a fee based on the actual cost to us of providing the services, plus an agreed
margin that will be applied to any non-third party costs. The services provided to members of the Asda group in respect of
convenience retail sites that are not part of the Disposed UK Business will be provided for a fee payable to us based on the
actual cost to us of providing the services, plus an agreed margin that will be applied to non-third party costs. Our liability for
provision of the services will be subject to limitations customary for an agreement of this nature, including an annual financial
cap on our liability of £12.2 million for most liabilities. In connection with such transitional arrangements, and as further
consideration for the UK Disposal to Asda, we have agreed that, for a period of 2 years from Completion, we will cover the
costs incurred by the Purchaser associated with the provision of Centralized Services to the Disposed UK Business, to the
extent that such services are not provided by us pursuant to the TSA; this will include our reimbursing the Purchaser for any
third party costs incurred by the Purchaser in procuring Centralized Services for the Disposed UK Business and the employment
costs (including certain redundancy costs) of any employees of the Disposed UK Business or the Purchaser who are, after
Completion, performing roles related to Centralized Services. The Seller has also agreed that it will, during the first two years
following Completion, provide quarterly contributions of £1.4125 million and £11.3 million in aggregate) to the Purchaser by
way of a contribution towards the costs that the Purchaser is expected to incur in integrating the employees of the Disposed
UK Business into the Asda group. EG Finco limited has provided certain guarantees in favor of entities transferred to Asda as
part of the UK Disposal to Asda, or the Purchaser, in respect of the obligations of the Group under: (i) the TSA; and (ii) certain
business sale agreements entered into by certain transferred entities and members of the Group in connection with
reorganizations effected prior to completion of the UK Disposal to Asda.

After the Completion Date, an affiliate of the Seller has agreed to grant a transitional sublease of part of the head office building
located at Waterside, Blackburn that is currently occupied by employees of the Disposed UK Business, Retained UK&I
Business and the Group’s non-UK businesses, to the Purchaser for occupation by certain employees of the Disposed UK
Business for a period of two years from Completion for a peppercorn rent. See “Certain relationships and Related Party
_Transactions—Transactions with Related Parties—Transactions with Asda relating to the UK Disposal to Asda.”_

On the Completion Date, the Seller and the Target also entered into a transitional brand license agreement which took effect
immediately following Completion (the “Brand Licence Agreement”). Pursuant to the Brand Licence Agreement, we granted
the Target Group a non-exclusive right to use certain of our brands, including the ‘EG’ and ‘Euro Garages’ brands, for a period
of three years, royalty free, to allow the Target Group to rebrand its sites and businesses (subject to earlier termination rights).
The Target will have a right to extend the term of the brand license for a further two years if it has not completed this debranding
process by the end of the expiry of the initial three-year term, subject to the parties agreeing a royalty fee for the use of such
brands during such extension. As the LEON brand forms part of the Target Group, the Purchaser, the Seller and certain members
of the Target Group that operate the LEON business entered into a side letter at Completion (the “LEON Side Letter”) under
which the Purchaser and such members of the Target Group agreed to act reasonably and in good faith in considering a request
from the Seller to enter into a franchise agreement for the operation of a foodservice outlet under the LEON brand outside the
United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland and the Seller has certain rights to make an offer to purchase the LEON brands or
business in the event of a future disposal of such brands or business (that is not part of a wider transaction involving the Asda
group or Target Group). The LEON Side Letter will remain in place for a period of 10 years subject to certain earlier termination
rights and events.

On May 30, 2023, the Seller, the Purchaser and Asda Stores Limited entered into a side letter in connection with the EV charger
business, which is part of the Retained UK&I Business (the “EVPoint Side Letter”). Under the EVPoint Side Letter the Seller,
the Purchaser and Asda have documented their intention that EV Point Services Limited (a member of the Group) or an affiliate
will be appointed as sole provider, operator and installer of electric vehicle charging points at Asda sites (including the sites
held by the Target Group) and have agreed to use reasonable endeavors to agree the terms and conditions of such appointment
including the terms of a framework agreement under which that appointment will be documented following Completion. The
EVPoint Side Letter will (in addition to certain earlier termination rights and events) terminate if the framework agreement has
not been entered into by the date falling 24 months from Completion.

Following the Completion Date the Seller and the Purchaser will agree the terms on which we will, in respect of the Retained
UK&I Business, occupy sites that remain owned by the Target Group, or the Target Group will, in respect of the Disposed UK
Business, occupy sites that, following completion of the carve-out transaction described above, were transferred to the


-----

ownership of the Group, including sites where the operations of the Retained UK&I Business and Disposed UK Business are
co-located. This will include rights of occupation in respect of sites on which EV charging points, including ‘evpoint’-branded
chargers, have, prior to Completion, been installed by us.

(1) Reflects the Pre-Offering Transactions, comprising $2,517 million of net proceeds of the UK Disposal to Asda, the Amend and Extend the U.S. Sale and
Leaseback, the Non-Core Asset Disposals and the application of the proceeds therefrom (excluding the application of the proceeds from the Non-Core
Minit Mart Disposal (Kentucky and Tennessee)), which were used to repay a portion of the Existing Senior Secured Term Loan Facilities and partially
redeem the Existing Notes. See “Summary—The Transactions.”

(2) Actual cash as of June 30, 2023 represents cash as of June 30, 2023, including proceeds of $43 million from the Non-Core Minit Mart Disposal (Missouri
and Kansas) and net proceeds of $1.4 billion from the U.S. Sale and Leaseback, as well as $139 million of cash held for sale, which primarily relates to
the UK Disposal to Asda. See “Summary—The Transactions.” As adjusted cash figures represent estimated cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2023
after applying the net proceeds from the Pre-Offering Transactions to repay or redeem certain indebtedness and pay related fees. As further adjusted cash
for the Offering Transactions represents our estimated cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2023 following the Offering Transactions and excludes
approximately $32 million of expected accrued and unpaid interest in connection with the redemption of the Existing Notes, which will be paid from
cash on hand. Actual amounts may vary.

(3) Amounts reflect the principal amount outstanding and do not reflect accrued and unpaid interest.

(4) The ‘actual’ column represents the U.S. dollar-equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of the indebtedness outstanding under the Senior Credit
Facilities as of June 30, 2023. The ‘as adjusted’ columns represent the U.S. dollar-equivalent of the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the
Senior Credit Facilities which are not to be redesignated as Extended Senior Secured Term Loan Facilities following the Conditions Satisfaction Date,
respectively. In July 2023, we prepaid $462 million (equivalent) of our Existing Senior Secured Term Loan Facilities with a portion of the proceeds from
the U.S. Sale and Leaseback and we intend to use the proceeds from the Pre-Offering Transactions to prepay $2.2 billion (equivalent) of our Existing
Senior Secured Term Loan Facilities. See “Summary—Recent Developments—Senior Credit Facilities Prepayment and Existing Notes Redemption.”

(5) Represents the U.S. dollar-equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of the indebtedness outstanding under the Extended Senior Secured Term Loan
Facilities following the Conditions Satisfaction Date. Pursuant to the Amend and Extend, we extended the maturity of $3,162 million (equivalent) of
term loan indebtedness from February 2025 to February 2028 through a combination of the redesignation of existing facilities to new facilities with the
extended maturity and new-money commitments. In connection with the Amend and Extend and the utilization of Tranche D Term Facilities, we will
pay certain fees, costs and expenses totaling $170 million. See “Summary—Recent Developments—Senior Credit Facilities Amend and Extend.”

(6) The Revolving Credit Facilities had €220 million and $50 million drawn as of the Completion Date and such amounts are expected to remain outstanding
on the Issue Date. The balance outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facilities arises from drawings we have made in keeping with our cyclical
utilization and repayment of the facilities for working capital management purposes.

**MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF**

**OPERATIONS**

_The discussion and analysis below provides information that we believe is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the_
_historical consolidated financial position and results of operations of EG Group. You should read this discussion in conjunction_
_with the EG Group Financial Statements included elsewhere herein and the sections entitled “Presentation of Financial and_
_Other Information” and “Selected Historical Financial Data.”_

_This section includes forward-looking statements, including those concerning future sales, costs, capital expenditures,_
_acquisitions and financial condition. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that_
_could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Results_
_of operations for prior years are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full fiscal year 2023 or any_
_future period. See “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors.”_

_The following discussion of our results of operations also makes reference to certain non-IFRS financial measures. Prospective_
_investors should bear in mind that these non-IFRS measures are not financial measures defined in accordance with IFRS, may_
_not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies, may have limitations as analytical tools and should_
_not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under IFRS. See “Presentation_
_of Financial and Other Information—Presentation of Financial Information—Non-IFRS Financial Measures.”_

**Overview**

We are a leading independent global convenience retailer that served over 1.1 billion customers worldwide in the year ended
December 31, 2022 (over 3 million customers per day). We have a diversified portfolio of sites across three continents, which
consists of 5,937 sites after giving effect to the Transactions. Based on our site count (after giving effect to the Transactions),
we are the third largest independent convenience retailer chain globally, the fifth largest in the United States and the second
largest in Continental Europe and Australia.

Our total fuel volumes sold was 17.7 billion liters for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 (16.1 billion liters after giving
effect to the Transactions). Our global operations span six of the ten largest fuel markets in Europe by fuel volumes sold,
namely Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, all six states in Australia and 30 states
across the United States. Our Fuel operations are complemented by our Grocery & Merchandise and Foodservice operations,
under which we offer our proprietary brands as well as partner with attractive third-party brands. We seek to deliver a modern
and convenient customer retail experience by providing a “one-stop shop” retail destination that offers a broad range of products
and services to address evolving customer needs, which increasingly revolve around conveniently located stores offering onestop solutions. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, we generated revenue of $26.2 billion, gross profit of $3.8 billion
and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16 of $1,147 million, in each case after giving effect to the Pre-Offering
Transactions.

**Key Performance Indicators**

We use certain financial key performance indicators (“KPIs”) to monitor the financial and operating performance of our
business.

_Gross Profit and Gross Margin_

Gross profit is calculated as revenue minus cost of sales. Gross profit is a key measure used by management to assess our
business volumes and the profitability of our sales revenue after deduction of direct costs and free of the impact of varying
levels of wholesale fuel pricing. We monitor gross profit, and other indicators derived from gross profit, because they measure
our profitability per U.S. dollar of revenue in a comparable way across periods and in relation to other companies in our
industry. We believe revenue is not a KPI for the business due to the variability across periods arising from the distorting
impact of volatile wholesale fuel pricing on reported fuel revenues.

We monitor other indicators derived from gross profit, such as gross margin to assess profitability in our categories of
operations. In our Grocery & Merchandise and Foodservice business streams, we calculate gross margin as gross profit divided
by total revenue. Fuel gross margin, or Fuel cost per liter, is a key measure used by management and is calculated as Fuel gross
profit divided by Fuel volumes.

_Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16 and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16_

Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16 is a key measure used by management to evaluate our underlying operating performance,
review business trends, identify strategies to improve results and make day-to-day operating decisions. We believe this measure
allows a comparison of our results across periods and across companies in the industry in which we operate on a consistent
basis, by removing the effects on our operating performance of our capital structure (such as the varying levels of interest
expense), asset base and capital investment cycle (such as depreciation and amortization), items largely outside our control
(such as income taxes), and exceptional items that we view as not reflective of our underlying operating performance and which
we are permitted to adjust for in calculating covenant compliance under the terms of our financing agreements.

We define Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16 as profit/(loss) for the period before net finance costs, tax, depreciation of tangible
fixed assets, depreciation of right of use assets, amortization, impairment and profit on disposal, and excluding exceptional
items relating to certain non-recurring costs and non-cash items, and estimated lease costs under IFRS 16 deducted.

We adjust for certain exceptional items to calculate Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16 due to their size and nature in order aid
comparability. Therefore, in order to allow an understanding of our underlying trading performance, items recognized in
reported profit or loss before tax which, by virtue of their size and/or nature, do not reflect our underlying performance, are
shown as exceptional items. Exceptional items are those which are separately identified by virtue of their size or incidence and
include, but are not limited to, acquisition costs, impairment charges, reorganization costs, profits and losses on disposal of
subsidiaries, and other one-off items which meet this definition. All items are shown gross, unless IFRS permits netting of such
expenditure and tax on exceptional items has been calculated using the applicable statutory tax rate for taxable items.

In addition to the EBITDA from each of our regional businesses, Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16 also includes certain
shared service center costs.

Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16 – represents our Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16 adjusted for estimated
equivalent results of acquired businesses in the pre-acquisition period and other EBITDA annualizations, and the estimated
synergies from acquisitions which have been determined as part of the investment appraisal which have yet to be recognized.
For the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16 represents Adjusted EBITDA before
IFRS 16 adjusted to include (i) the estimated EBITDA from acquisitions, group initiatives and synergies and other EBITDA
annualizations, (ii) run rate adjustment relating to the Non-Core Asset Disposals, (iii) the EBITDA impact of the UK Disposal
to Asda and (iv) annualized rent expenses from the U.S. Sale and Leaseback. We use Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA before
IFRS 16 to evaluate our leverage ratio and our ability to incur and service our indebtedness.

_Capital expenditures_

Capital expenditures represents our purchase of property, plant and equipment and intangibles for the periods presented, which,
for budgeting and tracking purposes, we categorize as maintenance capital expenditure and growth capital expenditure. We
define maintenance capital expenditure as capital expenditure required to maintain the performance of our network. We define
growth capital expenditure as consisting of (i) Capital Expenditure on Acquired Sites, defined as capital expenditure on the
integration of newly acquired sites into our existing brands and formats, including with respect to rebranding our acquired sites,
(ii) Capital Expenditure on New Sites, defined as capital expenditure on new sites, such as new-to-industry sites and new
highway PFS sites, including with respect to rolling out non-fuel offerings at these sites and (iii) Capital Expenditure on
Existing Sites, defined as capital expenditure on existing sites, including the refurbishment of existing sites, including
extensions, minor refits of our existing PFS sites, the change in the operating model of some of our existing sites and the


-----

rebranding of our existing sites. See “—Capital expenditures” for a further breakdown of our capital expenditures by
maintenance capital expenditure and growth capital expenditure and region.

_Adjusted cash conversion ratio_

Adjusted cash conversion ratio represents adjusted free cash flow divided by Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16. We define
Adjusted free cash flow as Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16 plus or minus changes in net working capital minus maintenance
capital expenditures. Adjusted free cash flow is a non-IFRS measure of liquidity, which we present because we believe that it
is widely used by certain investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as a measure of our efficiency at generating
cash. The following table provides a reconciliation of Adjusted free cash flow to Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16 for the
period.

Following the Transactions, we expect our adjusted free cash flow to be impacted by our interest expenses, cash taxes and the
payment of deferred indirect taxes (which are payable on a straight line basis until September 2027) and we expect our annual
maintenance capital expenditure to be in the range of $110 million to $130 million in the near term. We continue to focus on
free cash flow generation as part of our revised financial policy and so we assess our discretionary growth capital requirements
on an ongoing basis to ensure the expenditure we incur is within the remaining free cash flow available to the Group.

_Leverage Ratio_

Leverage ratio is presented as the ratio of as adjusted pro forma net debt before lease liabilities (net of unamortized financing
costs) to Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16. We present leverage ratio because our debt investors consider this
metric useful in understanding our financial position.

_Consolidated Historical and As Adjusted Financial Information and Other Data—Other Financial and Operating Data—Key_
_Performance Indicators and Non-Financial Data.”_

**Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations and Financial Condition**

**_Our Business Model and Business Streams_**

Our fuel operations are complemented by our Grocery & Merchandise and Foodservice business streams, under which we offer
both our proprietary brands as well as partner with third-party brands. We seek to deliver a modern and convenient customer
retail experience by providing a “one-stop shop” retail destination that offers a broad range of products and services to address
evolving customer needs. We believe our diversified product mix can create a ‘halo effect’ through which we can generate
additional profitability from increased customer footfall and sales volumes. Our non-fuel business has become a cornerstone
of our long-term diversification strategy as we seek a more diversified earnings base. In addition, we continue to invest in being
the convenience destination of choice for our customers including by installing electrical vehicle charging points in our site
network to meet evolving customer demand.

Compared to Fuel products, our Grocery & Merchandise and Foodservice businesses are less exposed to fluctuations in the
price of a single commodity. Based on our relationships and agreements with our partners, we also have a range of flexibility
(with greater flexibility for non-branded Foodservice offerings) to control the selling prices of our products, including managing
inventory, selecting promotional offers and designing in-store layouts, each to maximize margins and enhance customer
experiences. In addition to our primary Fuel, Grocery & Merchandise and Foodservice activities, we also offer certain other
ancillary services such as car washes, lottery ticket sales and ATMs.

_Grocery & Merchandise_

Grocery & Merchandise continues to be the most stable of our business streams, both in terms of sales volume, which has
steadily grown, and gross margin, which has largely remained stable over time. We have cultivated strong relationships with
well-known retail and grocery brands such as SPAR, Rewe and Carrefour, in addition to operating our own proprietary brands,
including the Cumberland Farms’ Farmhouse Kitchen brand in the United States, which supports our convenience offering to
consumers. We also participate in rebate agreements with our Grocery & Merchandise partners whereby we receive rebates
from the supplier upon reaching specified sales volumes. As our scale has increased over time, we are able to build upon our
size to increase the level of rebate as a percentage of sales from our Grocery & Merchandise partners, allowing us to increase
our gross profit for Grocery & Merchandise. We continue to focus on further enhancement to our Grocery & Merchandise
offering, particularly in Continental Europe where our lower penetration of this market presents an opportunity for future
growth and development. We also regularly review our brand portfolio and evaluate opportunities to partner with other leading
convenience retail businesses and expand our ancillary service to further enhance our offer.

Our financial results are affected by changes in consumer preferences and perceptions, demographic trends over time and our
ability to anticipate, identify and respond to such changes and trends is key. For example, in 2022, our Grocery & Merchandise
operations were negatively impacted by changes in consumer buying behavior, due to the inflationary pressures and cost-ofliving increases seen in most regions. Margins remained consistent from 2021 to 2022, and into the first half of 2023, despite
some unavoidable underlying product cost pressures. We believe this is not only reflective of our disciplined approach to
purchasing and pricing but also of the resilience of convenience retail against the backdrop of rising prices.

_Foodservice_

We believe our strategic focus and growth in Foodservice has provided a strong platform of choice for customers, across our
multiple brand partnerships and proprietary brands. Our Foodservice brand partners include globally recognized brands such
as Starbucks, Burger King, Subway and KFC, as well as strong local brands such as Pomme de Pain and Greggs. We believe
these well-known brands increase customer confidence in our products and services and lead to increased footfall and sales
volumes. We complement our existing portfolio of partner brands through our proprietary Foodservice brands, such as
Cooplands, providing further product diversification for the Group. Our strong mix of proprietary and third party brands is part
of our effort to focus on our Foodservice offering as a means of increasing revenue and profitability across our forecourt
network.


-----

We have established a scaled, global footprint across the Foodservice market, driven by our strong international brand
partnerships and strategic acquisitions. Expansion of our Foodservice operations has transformed our sites into destinations
serving multiple customer needs, which supports our increased customer traffic and sales volumes. In 2022, inflationary
pressures on wholesale food cost prices and a lag in passing these through retail prices adversely impacted the performance of
our Foodservice operations in the second half of the year, although we saw improved operating performance in this stream in
the six month period to June 30, 2023.

_Fuel Operations_

We have Fuel retail operations in ten countries, including in six of the ten largest fuel markets in Europe, the United States and
Australia. We have continued to focus on the growth and quality of our network through the development of NTIs, knock‑downrebuilds, upgrades and conversions to our COCO model, as well as the acquisitions of businesses on a strategic basis. We
believe our wholesale supply agreements with well-known brands, such as Esso and BP, increase customer confidence in our
products and services, leading to higher customer traffic, and support our premium positioning on Fuel. We also operate a
wholesale supply business, EG Fuel, that focuses on the strategic and operational fuel supply and distribution in Continental
Europe.

Fuel revenue can fluctuate from period to period, mainly as a result of changes in wholesale fuel prices. For example, at the
onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, oil and fuel prices fell significantly but as the economy recovered from the pandemic, prices
began to increase over time. Market volatility caused by ongoing geopolitical events following the conflict in Ukraine impacted
wholesale oil prices and demand again in 2022. During the first half of 2023, international fuel prices have largely returned to
the level prior to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

All regions except Continental Europe noted a slight decrease in volumes in 2022 due to the impact of higher than average fuel
retail prices and cautious consumer spending, with 17.6 billion liters sold in 2022 compared to 17.7 billion liters in 2021. We
sold 8.5 billion of liters of fuel in the six months ended June 30, 2023 across all regions, compared to 8.4 billion liters of fuel
sold in the six months ended June 30, 2022, with the 2022 OMV Acquisition in Germany supporting growth in fuel volumes
in Continental Europe as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2022. In the year ended December 31, 2022, Fuel margins
strengthened slightly against a backdrop of rising inflation and continued volatile macroeconomic environment in the oil
industry, including price sensitive consumers switching to lower priced competitors in certain markets, covering the increased
cost of business delivery. In the six months ended June 30, 2023, Fuel margins decreased slightly, against the backdrop of the
higher than usual margins seen throughout 2022, and as a result of adverse stock revaluations in our EG Fuel business.

At our company-owned sites, we employ a dynamic pricing strategy through specialized software, which we have improved
with our own algorithms based on the data we collect from our network of sites. In the regular course of our business, we enter
into relationships with fuel suppliers whereby we commit to purchase certain minimum quantities of fuel in order to benefit
from better pricing conditions. However, since fuel products are commodities, we have no control over the changing market
value of our inventories. As our inventory is valued at the lower of weighted average cost and net realizable value (which is
based on market price), under our inventory valuation methodology, price fluctuations impact both cost of sales and the value
of the inventory reported in our financial statements. In addition, if the book value of our inventory is above its net realizable
value on a certain balance sheet date, we are required to write down the inventory to net realizable value. Due to the pricing
arrangements under our fuel supply agreements and the high turnover levels of inventory held, the measurement of the value
of our inventory is based on the cost price of the inventory at our PFS sites.

_Electric Vehicle Charging Stations_

To meet evolving customer demands, we are in the process of rolling out EV charging stations across our network, with a focus
on the European market. As of June 30, 2023, we operated 635 electric charging points (compared to 470 as of December 31,
2022) across 189 sites in the United Kingdom and Continental Europe. We have earmarked a broader rollout of EV chargers
across hundreds of our sites through to 2026. All the EV charging points in the United Kingdom will form part of our Retained
UK&I Business. We plan to continue our rollout of EV chargers during the remainder of 2023, with a further 60 electric
charging points operating by the end of the year, a majority of which will be ultra-fast chargers. See “Business—Our Additional
_Operations—Electric Vehicle Charging Stations and Alternative Fuels—Electric Vehicle Charging Stations”._

**_Our Site Operating Models_**

We have a mix of COCO, CONCO and ‘other’ operating models, such as retailer or dealer-owned and operated sites, and these
different models result in different levels of revenue generation and costs and require different levels of capital expenditure.
We believe the COCO model provides us with greater control over our pricing policy, cost control and consistency in product
and service offerings across sites, having historically delivered higher profitability relative to sites operated under our other


-----

operating models. We therefore are consistently working towards extending the company-operated model to additional sites
and converting suitable non-company-operated sites into COCO sites. COCO conversions require some capital expenditure,
and we typically wait until the expiration of our franchise, dealership or retail agreements, as applicable, so as to not trigger
early termination fees before implementing a COCO conversion for suitable sites. In the year ended December 31, 2022 and
the six months ended June 30, 2023, we converted 53 sites and 20 sites, respectively, to our preferred COCO operating model.

We plan to continue this strategy of COCO conversions on a site specific basis where it makes economic sense, in particular
in certain European markets such as Italy and Germany. Our operating models are summarized as follows:

  - **COCO (company-owned, company-operated). COCO operations are directly managed by us and we are responsible**
for all aspects of the performance and maintenance of the site. Under the COCO model, our revenue reflects the
income received from sales of our Fuel, Grocery & Merchandise and Foodservice products and services and our cost
of goods sold reflects the cost of our Fuel, Grocery & Merchandise and Foodservice products and ancillary services.
When sales volumes and unit margins are high, our COCO sites present a greater opportunity for increased gross profit
and EBITDA than sites operating under our other operating models because we largely control prices on Fuel, Grocery
& Merchandise and Foodservice sales. However, the COCO model exposes us to a greater risk of declines in revenue
and increases in costs and to volatility in market demand. In addition, we also bear considerable operating and capital
costs in connection with COCO sites, which impacts our operating profit. As of June 30, 2023, we operated 4,314
sites under the COCO model, and approximately 34%, 100%, 96% and 100% of our sites in Continental Europe, the
United Kingdom and Ireland, the United States, and Australia, respectively, were COCO sites. All of the sites that
will be sold in connection with the UK Disposal to Asda are operated under the COCO model.

  - **CONCO (company-owned, not company-operated).** Under the CONCO model, the dealer, franchisee or retailer is
responsible for all non-fuel operations, as well as operating costs associated with the management of the site, whereas
we are responsible for any capital and maintenance costs associated with the fuel equipment and, in some instances,
we have a consignment arrangement for fuel sales and inventory. Under a consignment arrangement, fuel revenue
from the site reflects the income received from the sale of fuel products to the end customer. A commission on fuel
sales is payable by the Group to the dealer. In a number of our dealer operated sites, we receive a commission on
Grocery & Merchandise products sold by the dealer to the end customer. Fuel revenue from retailer operated sites
reflects the income received from the sale of fuel products to the end customer. A commission on fuel sales is also
payable by us to the retailer. The retailer also pays a rent to the Group, which we record as other income. As of June
30, 2023, we operated 1,474 sites under the CONCO model, and approximately 43%, 0%, 4% and 0% of our sites in
Continental Europe, the United Kingdom and Ireland, the United States, and Australia, respectively, were CONCO
sites. None of our CONCO sites will be sold in connection with the UK Disposal to Asda.

  - **‘Other’ Sites (retailer or dealer-owned and operated). ‘Other’ sites are owned and operated by a third party who**
has full responsibility for the performance and maintenance of the site. All fuel and non-fuel sales, operating costs and
capital expenditures are incurred by the dealer or retailer, unless we agree to pay certain maintenance expenses on the
assets or property we own. We either have a fuel supply arrangement in place with the third party, or, alternatively,
the fuel supply is on a consignment basis. Under a consignment arrangement, fuel prices may be set by us, and the
fuel revenue from ‘other’ sites reflects the income received from the sale of fuel products to the dealer or retailer. A
commission on fuel sales is payable by us to the dealer or retailer. Under a non-consignment arrangement, fuel revenue
from such site reflects the income received from the sales of fuel products to the dealer or retailer at a price set by the
dealer, retailer or operator and established in an agreement. In certain of our dealer owned sites, we receive a
commission on convenience retail products sold by the dealer to the end customer. The costs associated with
transportation of fuel to the sites are borne by us and included in our distribution costs. As of June 30, 2023, we
operated 744 sites under the ‘other’ sites model, all of which are in Continental Europe, primarily in Germany, Italy
and Benelux, with approximately 23% of our sites in Continental Europe operated under ‘other’ site models. None of
our ‘other’ sites will be sold in connection with the UK Disposal to Asda.

**_Geographic Mix_**

The geographic scope of our business has expanded significantly since our inception and our financial results are affected by
our mix of total revenue from sales generated across geographic areas. Our range of fuel and non-fuel products have varying
margins in the different geographic regions in which we operate and, therefore, our geographic mix impacts our results of
operation. However, geographical diversification also provides us with a degree of natural hedging against certain external
factors, such as variations in weather, localized economic downturns and other localized events that may have a temporary or
sustained impact on our operations.


-----

For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022 and the six months ended June 30, 2023, we reported our results of operations
in four key geographical areas – Continental Europe, United Kingdom & Ireland, United States and Australia. Following the
UK Disposal to Asda, our business will be composed of three key geographical areas of operations – Europe (in which we will
report the Retained UK&I Business), the United States and Australia. Our key geographic areas are described in more detail
below.

_United States_

Our United States region operates across 30 states and is the fifth largest independent C-store estate in the country. The region
contributed 44% of our gross profit and 46% of Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16 in the year ended December 31, 2022 and
41% of our gross profit and 37% of Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16 in the six months ended June 30, 2023, making it the
largest region within our Group in terms of profitability and second largest in terms of site count. Our United States business
is a scalable, nationwide platform and one which we continue to look at for further opportunities, and to continue to invest in
organic growth, through new to industry sites, refits, rebranding opportunities and expanding Foodservice offerings at existing
sites. Our key operating expenditures in the United States are primarily site-based costs such as staff, property, regional head
office and lease costs.

We regularly perform a review of our portfolio and made the decision to exit 42 of our sites across the states of Wisconsin,
Minnesota and Indiana, with these divested in the first half of 2022. This decision was made due to the small number of sites
that we operated in these states, which limited our ability to operate efficiently.

We also generated net proceeds of $84.4 million from the sale of 55 of our convenience retail locations to Casey’s General
Stores Inc. pursuant to the Non-Core Minit Mart Disposal (Kentucky and Tennessee) and generated $43 million of net proceeds
from the disposal of 26 non-core sites pursuant to the Non-Core Minit Mart Disposal (Missouri and Kansas), with negligible
impact from this disposal on our EBITDA of the Group.

As part of our continued focus on deleveraging, in May 2023 we completed the sale and leaseback of a portfolio of assets on
the east coast of the United States, comprising 414 sites across our Cumberland Farms, Fastrac, Tom Thumb and Sprint brands,
for gross proceeds of $1.5 billion. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—The U.S. Sale and Leaseback
_Transaction”._

As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2023, 96% of our sites were COCO and 4% were CONCO in the United States. In 2022,
Grocery & Merchandise, Foodservice and Fuel represented 43%, 3% and 50%, respectively, of our gross profit in the region.
For the six months ended June 30, 2023, Grocery & Merchandise, Foodservice and Fuel represented 46%, 4% and 45%,
respectively, of our gross profit in the region. Our U.S. Grocery & Merchandise operations include our proprietary brands and
we also operate a distribution center and culinary center from our regional office located in Westborough, Massachusetts. The
table below presents additional key KPIs for the United States during the periods indicated.

_Europe_

Continental Europe

We operate a large European network, initially built around the acquisition of our French and Benelux operations of EFR,
which we acquired in 2016, and the 2018 acquisitions of Esso Italy, NRGValue in the Netherlands and Esso Germany. We
expanded further in Germany in 2022 following the OMV Acquisition and the M&L and Geiger Fast Food Acquisition. In the
six months ended June 30, 2023, we opened a further four sites, out of which two were in Benelux, one in France and one in
Germany. The region contributed 26% of our gross profit and 36% of Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16 in the year ended
December 31, 2022 and 27% of our gross profit and 40% of Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16 in the six months ended June
30, 2023. Our key operating expenditures in Continental Europe are primarily site-based costs such as staff, property, regional
head office and lease costs.


-----

Our European estate also represents the highest proportion of CONCO sites, with 2,202 dealer, franchisee or retailer operated
sites as of December 31, 2022, largely across Italy and Germany. We continued to review and identify dealer‑operated sites
with the potential to convert selected suitable sites to our preferred COCO model, with 52 and 20 conversions taking place
during the year ended December 31, 2022 and the six months ended June 30, 3023, respectively.

We completed our acquisition of OMV’s German forecourt business, consisting of 285 sites in southern Germany, on May 1,
2022. Following the German Anti-Trust Authorities’ clearance decision, we agreed to divest 48 sites, 24 of which were in our
existing estate and 24 were in the OMV estate. We completed these divestments in the second quarter of 2022. The OMV
Acquisition further bolsters our established footprint within Germany and demonstrates our confidence in the German market,
a key European market in which we believe we have significant growth potential, including through COCO conversions,
rebranding initiative, including of our BP sites in France to Esso, and growth of our Foodservice and Grocery & Merchandise
offering.

During the year ended December 31, 2022, we continued to invest in our Foodservice proposition, which demonstrates our
desire to enhance our non-fuel offering across the region, with the acquisition of seven KFCs in southern Germany in January
2022 with the M&L and Geiger Fast Food Acquisition. We also saw continued strong momentum from the rollout of third‑party
Foodservice outlets across Continental Europe, with 293 and 277 outlets open at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2023,
respectively.

As of December 31, 2022, 34% of our sites were COCO, 33% were CONCO and 22% were made up of other operating models
in Continental Europe. In 2022, Grocery & Merchandise, Foodservice and Fuel represented 24%, 10% and 56%, respectively,
of our gross profit in the region. For the six months ended June 30, 2023, Grocery & Merchandise, Foodservice and Fuel
represented 25%, 12% and 51%, respectively, of our gross profit in the region. The table below presents additional key KPIs
for Continental Europe during the periods indicated.

Number of Employees ............................................................................................... 8,220 9,117 8,682 8,828


United Kingdom and Ireland

Our United Kingdom and Ireland business represents our most mature business in terms of our forecourt strategy and customer
proposition, having grown over a period of 20 years, from a single site in 2001, to a network of 388 petrol filling stations and
1,132 Foodservice outlets at the end of 2022, with operations that include our proprietary Foodservice brands, LEON and
Cooplands, in addition to our extensive relationships with global retail brands. Following the UK Disposal to Asda, we will
have a network of 31 petrol filling stations and 613 Foodservice outlets. One of our proprietary Foodservice brands, LEON,
will be sold as part of the UK Disposal to Asda. The region contributed 20% of our gross profit and 20% of Adjusted EBITDA
before IFRS 16 in the year ended December 31, 2022 and 23% of our gross profit and 28% of Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS
16 in the six months ended June 30, 2023. Our key operating expenditures in the United Kingdom and Ireland are primarily
site-based costs such as staff, property and lease costs. Our headquarters are located in Blackburn, United Kingdom and, as a
result, most of our head office costs are borne in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Costs of our head office functions generally
comprise administrative expenses related to our IT, finance, commercial, legal, property and human resource functions, which
are generally fixed in nature. The increase in costs of our head office functions over time is generally reflective of the increasing
size of our business. Costs of our head office functions will decrease as a result of the UK Disposal to Asda, as a number of
employees will be transferred to Asda and a portion of the head office will also be leased to Asda and a portion of the head off
costs will also be incurred by Asda.

As of December 31, 2022 and as of June 30, 2023, prior to the UK Disposal to Asda, 100% of our sites were COCO in the
United Kingdom and Ireland. In 2022, Grocery & Merchandise, Foodservice and Fuel represented 15%, 60% and 22%,
respectively, of our gross profit in the region. For the six months ended June 30, 2023, Grocery & Merchandise, Foodservice
and Fuel represented 15%, 58% and 24%, respectively, of our gross profit in the region. The table below presents additional
KPIs for the United Kingdom and Ireland during the periods indicated, in each case, prior to the UK Disposal to Asda. For
more information on our Retained UK&I Business, see “The Transactions—The UK Disposal to Asda.”

_Australia_

We acquired our Australian site network in 2019 and it is now the second largest independent C-store retailer by site numbers
in Australia. The Australian business consists of a mix of highway and non-highway sites which are predominantly leasehold.
All sites provide Fuel and Grocery & Merchandise offerings. As of June 30, 2023, we no longer have any Foodservice sites in
Australia. This is because our Foodservice operations in Australia have not been as profitable as other regions, due to different
market dynamics and local preferences. The region contributed 10% of our gross profit and 10% of Adjusted EBITDA before
IFRS 16 in the year ended December 31, 2022 and 9% of our gross profit and 9% of Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16 in the
six months ended June 30, 2023.

We remain focused on our investment in the transformation of the existing network through the continued upgrade of stores
and have recently completed the delivery of certain contractually committed rebranding obligations. We have 525 sites that
have been rebranded from Woolworths to EG in our Grocery & Merchandise stores and from Caltex to Ampol for Fuel (which
was part of our contractual rebrand from Caltex to Ampol). In Australia, we continue to focus on customer awareness and
working with key partners to attract and retain customers in store to capture the continued growth in our improved in-store
offers. Our key operating expenditures in Australia are primarily site-based costs such as staff, property, regional head office
and lease costs.

As of December 31, 2022, 100% of our sites were COCO in Australia. In 2022, Grocery & Merchandise and Fuel represented
21% and 78%, respectively, of our gross profit in the region. For the six months ended June 30, 2023, Grocery & Merchandise
and Fuel represented 23% and 76%, respectively, of our gross profit in the region. The table below presents additional key
KPIs for Australia during the periods indicated.

**_Foreign Currency Exchange Rates_**

Our results of operations are subject to foreign currency translation and transaction effects because we have operations in
Australia, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Ireland and the United
States, which are, and will continue to be, conducted primarily in the respective local currency. As we present our consolidated
financial statements in U.S. dollars, we must translate the assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses of all of our operations with
a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars at the closing rate for assets and liabilities and at the average
rate for the period for revenue and expense with all resulting exchange differences recognized in other comprehensive income.
Consequently, increases or decreases in the value of these currencies against the dollar may affect the value of our assets,
liabilities, revenue and expenses with respect to our non-U.S. dollar businesses in our consolidated financial statements, even
if their value has not changed in their functional currency, which creates a foreign currency translation risk.

We have or may have in the future intra-group and external loans where the denomination of the loan is in a currency other
than the U.S. dollar. As a result, we are and expect to be subject to certain shifts in currency valuations, such as between the
U.S. dollar and the pound sterling, euro or Australian dollar. See also “—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About
_Market Risk—Foreign Currency Risk”._


-----

In order to aid in the comparability of information between reporting periods and business units, we sometimes describe our
results on a constant currency basis. A significant amount of our operations do not have the U.S. dollar as the functional
currency and therefore our financial performance, which is reported in U.S. dollar, is impacted by the change in exchange rates.
Constant currency performance is calculated by translating performance of non-U.S. dollar regions using the foreign exchange
rates applicable in the comparative period and allows users to compare our performance on a consistent basis.

**_COVID-19 Pandemic_**

We have continued to adapt to the challenges caused by or related to COVID-19 and related variants. For example, revenue in
the first few months of 2022 and in 2021 was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic following decreased site footfall due to
travel restrictions across some of the regions in which we operate. During the year ended December 31, 2021, especially in the
first half of the year, our Fuel operations in particular continued to be impacted by the lockdown measures imposed by national
and state governments in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. While there was a recovery across the majority of regions
towards the end of 2021, overall volumes were adversely impacted by continued restrictions and work from home guidance
during 2021. Our Australian business was impacted more heavily by the COVID-19 pandemic than our other regions in the
year ended December 31, 2021, with severe lockdown restrictions in place for a large portion of the second half of the year.
Despite lower footfall in our stores, our convenience earnings remained resilient as a result of higher margins and investment
made in our non-fuel offering and in particular as a result of strong sale volumes and stable gross margin in our Grocery &
Merchandise operating segment. During the first half of 2023, we have continued to experience reduced Fuel sale volumes
globally, in part as a result of continued reduced footfall caused by a shift to hybrid working, reducing travel requirements for
employees. However, this has been offset by higher gross margins in our Fuel operations.

We also faced certain other ongoing obstacles during 2021 and 2022, including a stressed labor market which led to challenges
finding, hiring and retaining employees and increased wage pressures, with wages across the convenience retailer, restaurant
and retail industries in general continuing to rise, which directly contributed to increased operating expenses. The COVID-19
pandemic also accelerated a customer trend towards convenience shopping and home delivery, and even beyond the pandemic,
as customer behavior has transitioned to more hybrid routines, convenience has become a critical factor to our customers,
particularly in the grocery and foodservice sectors. As a result, we believe we are well positioned to meet our customers’
convenience needs, and we are focused on improving this even further through our digital strategy, which includes self-service
kiosks and rapid delivery through app-based delivery platforms. These digital initiatives are being rolled out in all countries in
which we operate.

During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, we also received support from governments, including the UK
government, in connection with our response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, this support included furlough and job
retention scheme reliefs, tax payment deferral schemes and business rates relief. For example, in the year ended December 31,
2021, we recognized government grant income of $10 million in relation to furlough program, such as the Coronavirus Job
Retention Scheme (“CJRS”) in the United Kingdom and its equivalents in other countries. In 2022, this support included tax
payment deferral schemes and business rates relief.

We also benefited from the business rates holiday for the retail, hospitality and leisure sector in the United Kingdom of $3
million and $25 million in the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Of the indirect taxes which were deferred
during 2020, the outstanding balance as at December 31, 2022 was $445 million, which is repayable over the period to
September 2027.

Historically, acquisitions have been a significant driver of the growth in our geographic scale, breadth of offerings, revenue
and profit margins. We have completed a number of selective acquisitions and disposals of varying sizes from 2021 through
2023, which may impact the comparability of our financial results between periods including as a result of purchase price
accounting, cost savings and synergies. Since we consolidate the results of operations of each acquired business in our financial
statements from the completion date of each acquisition and carve out the results of operations of each disposed business from
our financial statements from the completion date of each disposal, our historical financial periods are not directly comparable
to one another.

Following the closing date of an acquisition, our results are consolidated with the results of the acquired business and are
thereafter impacted by the revenues and expenses of the acquired business. In addition, our results are affected by other items
such as (i) our ability to realize synergies, (ii) selling, general and administrative functions such as sales, marketing, finance,


-----

human resources, information technology and management, (iii) the consolidation of our purchasing functions and increases in
margin due to our application of best practices and (iv) any costs we incur to realize synergies and similar items.

From time to time, we also dispose of business units or locations. As of the closing date of a disposal, the results of operations
and assets and liabilities attributable to the disposed business are no longer under the control of the Group and therefore are no
longer presented in our financial statements. We have historically generated profit from our disposals, which would positively
impact our cash position. However, disposals could also result in lower revenue, impairments of goodwill and a lower amount
of total assets on our balance sheet.

We account for acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting. As a result, the purchase price for the acquired business
is allocated to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values as of the date of the
acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over these allocations is assigned to goodwill, which is not amortized for
accounting purposes but is subject to testing for impairment at least annually. The allocation of the purchase price to the assets
acquired in the acquisition may result in an increase in amortization and depreciation expense because we will record the fair
value of the acquired intangible assets and adjust the book value of the acquired tangible assets to their fair value. We evaluate
the remaining depreciable lives of the tangible assets to reflect the estimated useful lives for purposes of calculating periodic
depreciation, and we will amortize the intangible assets over their estimated useful lives. We will also review the value of the
inventory and will adjust it to fair value, which may change the costs and expenses recognized by us upon the sale of this
acquired inventory.

The following table presents the acquisitions we completed between January 1, 2021, and June 30, 2023:

Continental Europe

_OMV Acquisition_

On May 1, 2022, we acquired 285 OMV PFS sites in Germany for consideration of $541 million (the “OMV Acquisition”).
The acquisition formed part of our growth strategy at the time. As per the German Anti-Trust Authorities’ clearance decision,
we agreed to divest 48 sites in order for the acquisition to proceed, 24 of which were in our existing estate and 24 in the OMV
estate. These divestments were completed in the third quarter of 2022. Transaction costs of $5 million relating to dealer
termination fees and real estate transfer taxes were recognized as exceptional distribution expenses in the income statement for
the year ended December 31, 2022. Transaction costs relating to legal fees of $3 million were recognized as exceptional
administrative expenses. The results of the OMV business have been consolidated in our financial statements from May 1,
2022, contributing €924 million ($947 million) of revenue and €25 million ($25 million) profit after tax between the date of
acquisition and December 31, 2022. In the six months ended June 30, 2021, OMV had revenue of $1,860 million. The OMV
acquisition was financed externally in 2021 through a portion of a $510 million term loan facility under our Senior Credit
Facilities Agreement, along with cash on our balance sheet, with the consideration paid in 2022.

_M&L and Geiger Fast Food Acquisition_

On January 1, 2022, we acquired M&L Gastronomiegesellschaft GmbH and Geiger Fast Food GmbH in Germany for
consideration of $33 million (“M&L and Geiger Fast Food Acquisition”). The portfolio acquired consisted of seven KFC stores.


-----

The acquisition formed part of our growth strategy at the time and enabled us to further expand into the European foodservice
market. The results of the M&L Gastronomiegesellschaft GmbH and Geiger Fast Food GmbH business have been consolidated
in our financial statements from January 1, 2022, contributing €18 million ($18 million) of revenue and €3 million ($4 million)
of profit after tax between the date of acquisition and December 31, 2022.

_Klink KFC Acquisition_

On June 30, 2021, we completed the acquisition of two existing KFC drive-thru restaurants in south Germany from Klink
Betriebe Gmbh & Co.’s. As part of this acquisition, property, plant and equipment of $4 million was acquired for consideration
of $11 million, generating goodwill of $7 million. The results of the Klink KFC business have been consolidated in our financial
statements since June 30, 2021.

_KMS Acquisition_

On January 18, 2021, we acquired KMS Autohof (“KMS”) in Germany (the “KMS Acquisition”). The acquisition consisted of
ten PFSs, six Burger King restaurants and ten gaming halls. The acquisition formed part of our growth strategy at the time and
enabled us to further expand into the European market. As part of the acquisition, net liabilities of $8 million were acquired for
consideration of $10 million, generating goodwill of $18 million. We have included the results of operations of KMS in our
consolidated financial statements since January 18, 2021.

United Kingdom and Ireland

_Cooplands_

On October 2, 2021, we acquired CS Food Group Holdings Limited (“Cooplands”) for a total consideration of $93 million.
Cooplands owns and operates bakery assets in the United Kingdom, including three bakeries that process ingredients and
manufacture fresh food distributed through its supply and logistics network to many stores and cafes, predominantly across the
north-east and Yorkshire regions. As part of the acquisition, net assets of $31 million were acquired for consideration of $93
million, generating goodwill of $62 million. We have included the results of operations of Cooplands in our consolidated
reporting since October 2, 2021. We financed this acquisition from cash on our balance sheet. The Cooplands sites will not be
disposed of in connection with the UK Disposal to Asda.

_Amsric Acquisition_

On September 26, 2021, we acquired 52 KFC restaurants in the UK & Ireland from Amsric Group. The acquired network,
across the south and south-west regions, comprised more than 1,600 team members and a mix of drive-thru and traditional
restaurant formats. The acquisition strengthened our customer proposition and is complementary to existing operations and our
long-term growth plans for the Foodservice business. As part of the acquisition, net assets of $10 million were acquired for
consideration of $139 million, generating goodwill of $129 million. In addition to the acquired restaurants, we purchased a
further 15 KFC sites from Amsric Group. The value of the property, plant and equipment and consideration was $20 million.
We have included the results of operations of Amsric in our consolidated reporting since September 26, 2021. We financed the
Amsric Acquisition and the LEON Acquisition by drawing on a £220 million term loan facility under our Senior Credit
Facilities Agreement, which was completed in December 2021, therefore our debt and cash interest expense increased as a
result of these acquisitions. The Amsric sites will not be disposed of in connection with the UK Disposal to Asda.

_LEON Acquisition_

On May 9, 2021, we completed the acquisition of LEON Restaurants (“LEON”). The acquisition enabled us to further enhance
our Foodservice portfolio. As part of the acquisition, net assets of $60 million were acquired for consideration of $139 million,
generating goodwill of $79 million. Transaction costs of $3 million relating to stamp duty, professional and legal fees were
recognized as exceptional administrative expenses in the 2022 income statement. We have included the results of operations
of LEON in our consolidated financial statements since May 9, 2021. We financed the LEON Acquisition and the Amsric
Acquisition by drawing on a £220 million term loan facility under our Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, which was completed
in December 2021, therefore our debt and cash interest expense increased as a result of the acquisition of LEON and Amsric
Group. The LEON sites were disposed of in connection with the UK Disposal to Asda.

_United States_

Sprint Acquisition

On December 14, 2021, we completed the acquisition of 34 company-operated fuel and convenience retail locations in Georgia
and South Carolina, USA and the proprietary ‘Sprint Kitchen’ Foodservice brand from Sprint, allowing us to expand our
footprint in the United States. The consideration for the acquisition was $283 million and the net assets recognized were $92
million, with goodwill of $191 million. Transaction costs of $1.5 million relating to professional and legal fees were recognized
as exceptional administrative expenses in the income statement for the year ended December 31, 2021. We have included the
results of operations of Sprint in our consolidated financial statements since December 14, 2021. We financed this acquisition
from cash on our balance sheet.

Mercury Acquisition

On June 1, 2021, we completed the acquisition of eight PFS sites from Mercury Fuel Service, Inc (“Mercury”) in Connecticut.
We already operated a network of Cumberland Farms locations in Connecticut and the addition of the Mercury sites has enabled
us to further expand the presence of the Cumberland Farms brand in the state. As part of the acquisition, net assets of $13
million were acquired for consideration of $34 million, generating goodwill of $21 million. We have included the results of
operations of Mercury in our consolidated financial statements since June 1, 2021.

These acquisitions have affected our results and limit the comparability of our results from period to period. Potential future
acquisitions may also impact our results in the future.

_Synergies Resulting from Acquisitions_

Acquisitions enable the consolidation of many of the functions of an acquired entity in order to achieve synergies. For example,
the OMV Acquisition was completed to further enhance our footprint in Continental Europe and to realize expected synergies,
rather than solely generate cash flows from its existing assets. Acquisitions we complete may also lead to increased sales
volumes, improved margins and customer retention through, among other measures, the offering of complementary products
and services to an expanding customer base in a wider geographic network and the use of our scale to procure additional
premium partnerships and favorable pricing terms in our supply contracts. These factors have contributed to the successful
integration of the acquisitions that we have made and the realization of synergies from such acquisitions. Our results for the
period during which an acquisition takes place are affected by the inclusion of the results of the acquired sites or business in
our consolidated results from the date of their combination or acquisition, but the full impact of a business combination or
acquisition is typically only reflected in our financial statements in the subsequent period as synergies and cost savings begin
to be realized. As a result, synergies that have already been and potentially can be realized from acquisitions we undertake may
limit the comparability of our results from period to period. See “Summary Consolidated Historical and As Adjusted Financial
_Information and Other Data—Other Financial and Operating Data—Key Performance Indicators and Non-Financial Data.”_
Our acquisitions also entail risks. See “Risk Factors—Our acquisitions, divestitures or group initiatives may not be successful
_and we may not achieve the returns, synergies, cost savings or other benefits initially anticipated from them.”_

_Disposals_

From time to time, we also dispose of business units or locations.

Europe

_UK Disposal to Asda_

On May 30, 2023, we announced our binding agreement to sell a substantial majority of our Fuel, Foodservice and Grocery
and Merchandise business in the United Kingdom to Asda. The transaction was completed on October 31, 2023 for
consideration of £2 billion. The proceeds will be used to repay our external debt. The UK Disposal to Asda is a transformational
step for us and provides a platform for us to further invest and focus on maximizing long-term growth opportunities and
shareholder value across the remaining international business. We will continue to operate in the United States, Australia,
Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Belgium, and will continue to consider our strategic options in the
Retained UK&I Business where the Cooplands bakery business and certain other foodservice brands will also be retained. The
Disposed UK Business has been presented as an asset held for sale in the EG Group Condensed unaudited consolidated interim
financial statements. See “The Transactions” and “Summary Consolidated Historical and As Adjusted Financial Information
_and Other Data—Other Financial and Operating Data.”_


-----

_Other_

In November 2022, we completed the divestment of GB3 Limited and its parent company Urban Origin Limited, both of which
we considered to be non-core assets. We recognized a profit on disposal of $1 million.

In 2022, we also divested 48 sites, 24 of which were in our existing estate and 24 were in the OMV estate, as a result of the
German Anti-Trust Authorities’ clearance decision relating to the completion of the OMV Acquisition.

In 2021, we also disposed of a number of UK sites sold following the outcome of the CMA’s review of the shareholders’
separate acquisition of Asda, which required us to divest a number of PFS sites by the end of 2021. This disposal resulted in a
profit of $72 million.

United States

_Non-Core Asset Disposals_
In April 2023, pursuant to the Non-Core Minit Mart Disposal (Missouri and Kansas), we completed the sale of 26 non-core
company operated Minit Mart locations in Missouri and Kansas with net proceeds of $43 million. In May 2023, we committed
to sell 65 of our convenience retail locations to Casey’s General Stores, Inc. in the Non-Core Minit Mart Disposal (Kentucky
and Tennessee), for gross consideration of $111 million and completed the sale of 55 of these sites in November 2023 for an
gross consideration of $101.4 million. These disposals allowed us to refine our geographic footprint the United States and focus
on regions where we can operate most efficiently by utilizing our existing network.

In relation to the Non-Core Minit Mart Disposal (Kentucky and Tennessee), the C-Store site numbers presented in this Offering
Memorandum, when adjusted for the Transactions or the Pre-Offering Transactions, are adjusted for the sale of 63 sites, which
include the 55 sites we have sold as of November 3, 2023 and an additional 8 sites which are held for sale and for which we
are actively looking for a buyer. We will continue to evaluate our strategic options in relation to the remaining two sites. The
financial calculations in relation to the Non-Core Minit Mart Disposal (Kentucky and Tennessee) in this Offering Memorandum
that are adjusted for the Transactions or the Pre-Offering Transactions have been adjusted for the sale of the full 65 sites.

U.S. Sale and Leaseback

On May 16, 2023, we completed the U.S. Sale and Leaseback, consisting of a portfolio of 414 sites across Cumberland Farms,
Fastrac, Tom Thumb and Sprint banners in the United States. We undertook the U.S. Sale and Leaseback as part of our
commitment to reducing our total net leverage, with net proceeds of approximately $1.4 billion. Following completion, we pay
an initial rent of $103 million per annum with respect to these assets, rising by 2% annually for the duration of the minimum
term on the leases (a range of 18-22 years across the portfolio). We have the option to renew the leases for a further five years
following the initial term; should we choose to do so a minimum of 50% of the properties must be renewed at each of the
renewal dates.

Australia

On May 12, 2023, we completed a sale and leaseback of three leasehold sites in New South Wales, Australia for a gross
consideration of $11 million.

Due to the changes in our scope of consolidation as a consequence of the acquisitions and disposals we made in the periods
under review, our results of operations over the periods under review may not be entirely comparable.

**Description of Key Income Statement Items**

**_Revenue_**

We provide three primary categories of products and services to our customers: Grocery & Merchandise, Foodservice and Fuel.
We also provide ancillary services, such as car washes, lottery ticket sales and ATMs, through our forecourt operations which
are recognized within other sales.

Revenue is recognized when we have a contract with a customer and a performance obligation has been satisfied, at the
transaction price allocated to that performance obligation. We do not adjust any of the transaction prices for the time value of
money due to the nature of our transactions being completed shortly after the transaction is entered into with the customer.


-----

Revenue from the sale of fuel and goods in store is recognized when the transaction is completed in store or at the filling station.
Revenue from fuel sales to authorized dealers is recognized when the goods are delivered to the specific site location and
control passes.

The treatment of fuel duty is determined by local laws and regulations as to when the duty becomes legally payable and who
carries the risks and obligations to the tax authorities. In all markets where fuel duty is applicable to fuel purchases and sales,
the cost of sales and revenues are reported including these duties, as our role in the transaction is that of principal.

Within the Group, there are a number of ‘dealer’ or ‘retailer’ arrangements in place, whereby a third party will be responsible
for some part of the operation of a site. When we act as principal, revenue is recognized in respect of the gross amount of
consideration paid by the customer. In line with IFRS 15, when we do not control the goods which are transferred, we act as
an agent and recognize revenue only in the amount of any fee or commission to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for
arranging for the specified goods or services to be provided by the other party.

We operate customer loyalty programs where customers accumulate points for purchases made that subsequently entitle them
to discounts on future purchases, and account for these programs in accordance with IFRS 15. Revenue from loyalty points is
recognized when the customer redeems the points. Revenue for points that are not expected to be redeemed is recognized in
proportion to the pattern of rights exercised by customers.

Revenue from the provision of services includes dealer and franchise revenues, commissions received for ancillary services
and car wash revenues, and is presented within other sales. Also included within other sales are include Grocery & Merchandise
stock sales to dealers in Europe, where we facilitates the sale and purchase of dry stock between a wholesale supplier and our
portfolio of dealers. Revenue from the provision of services such as car washes, lottery ticket sales and ATMs, is recognized
when the service is provided as that is the point in time at which the customer benefits from the service. Where we act as an
agent selling goods or services, only the commission income is included within revenue.

See Note 3 to the 2022 EG Group Audited Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum for further
detail.

**_Cost of Sales_**

Cost of sales represents direct costs incurred in the sale of goods and services including, among other things, commissions paid
to dealers, the purchase and delivery costs of Fuel, Grocery & Merchandise and Foodservice products supplied to our customers.
We refer to supplier incentives, rebates and discounts (such as volume-related discounts from suppliers and income received
from suppliers to support specific in-store promotional activities for supplier products) collectively as commercial income.
Commercial income is recognized as a deduction from cost of sales on an accruals basis based on the expected entitlement that
has been earned up to the balance sheet date for each relevant supplier contract.

We operate a number of brands under franchise agreements across our jurisdictions. Costs paid to franchise owners are
presented within cost of sales.

**_Distribution Costs_**

Distribution costs represent all direct costs of running our sites and include rental costs, the depreciation of property, plant and
equipment for site assets, utilities, staff and maintenance costs, site conversion costs and lease payments.

**_Administrative Expenses_**

Administrative expenses represent the central and regional overhead costs of the business, such as the cost of our head office
functions, including those of our IT, finance and human resource functions, utilities and transaction costs related to acquisitions.
Depreciation of plant, property and equipment for regional and central offices and amortization of intangible assets are also
charged to administrative expenses.

**_Profit on disposal_**

Profit or loss on disposal is calculated the difference between the net proceeds received from a disposal and the carrying value
of the asset being disposed of.


-----

**_Other Operating Income_**

Other operating income represents gains/losses on the disposal of property, plant and equipment and income received on the
termination of concession arrangements.

**_Share of Profit/(Loss) of Equity Accounted Investments_**

Share of profit/(loss) of equity accounted investments represents amounts in joint ventures’ and associates’ financial statements
prepared in accordance with IFRS adjusted by us for equity accounting purposes.

**_Finance Income_**

Finance income is recognized in the consolidated income statement in the year or period to which it relates using the effective
interest rate method. Finance income comprises:

  - interest receivable, which is recognized in the consolidated income statement as it accrues using the effective interest
method;

  - foreign exchange gains arising on financing; and

  - finance income, which is recognized in the consolidated income statement in the year in which it occurs.

**_Finance Costs_**

Finance costs are recognized in the consolidated income statement in the year or period in which they occur. Finance costs
comprise:

  - interest payable, which is recognized in the consolidated income statement as it accrues using the effective interest
method

  - foreign exchange losses arising on financing;

  - finance costs incurred on finance leases, which are recognized in profit or loss using the effective interest method; and

  - financing costs of raising debt.

**_Tax_**

Tax represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax. Current and deferred tax are recognized in profit or loss,
except when they relate to items that are recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case the
current and deferred tax are also recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.

Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on taxable profit or loss for the applicable year or period. Taxable profit
differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or
deductible in other periods or items that are never taxable or deductible. Our liability for current tax is calculated using tax
rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.

Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.

Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year or period when the liability is settled, or the
asset is realized based on tax laws and rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred
tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited in other comprehensive
income, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in other comprehensive income.

Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible
temporary differences can be utilized. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and
reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset
to be recovered.


-----

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current
tax liabilities, when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and when we intend to settle our current
tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

_Revenue_

Revenue decreased by $999 million, or 7%, from $15,217 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 to $14,218 million
for the six months ended June 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to the factors discussed below, in particular the
reduction in fuel prices following the highs seen in 2022. The table below shows our revenue for the six months ended June
30, 2022 and 2023, broken down by business stream and geography:

Other ................. 52 187 11 - **250** 50 204 16 1 **271**

Grocery & Merchandise

Revenue from our Grocery & Merchandise operations increased by $105 million, or 5%, from $2,148 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2022 to $2,253 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 driven by increased revenue from the United
States and Europe (including Continental Europe and the United Kingdom and Ireland), partially offset by decreased revenue
from Australia.

The increase in Grocery & Merchandise revenue in Europe was driven primarily by inflationary price increases and a strong
focus on product mix and pricing optimization in Continental Europe and the impact of investment in new sites and Asda ‘On
the move’ conversions, in addition to inflationary price increases in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Grocery & Merchandise
revenue from our United States operations increased primarily due to pricing initiatives. In Australia, the reduced Grocery &
Merchandise revenue was primarily driven by reduced tobacco sales.

Foodservice

Revenue from our Foodservice operations increased by $68 million, or 11%, from $627 million for the six months ended June
30, 2022 to $695 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 driven by increased revenue from the United States,
Continental Europe and the United Kingdom and Ireland and Australia.

The increase in Foodservice revenue in Europe was driven primarily by increased footfall and new store openings in Continental
Europe and strong sales across all brands, supported by new site openings in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Foodservice
revenue in the United States increased primarily due to the growth of our in-store Foodservice offering resulting from various
promotional activities, which more than offset the reduced revenue impact from the closure of certain non-profitable
Foodservice outlets. Foodservice revenue from our Australian operations remained materially unchanged for the periods
between the six months ended June 30, 2022 and the six months ended June 30, 2023, noting that Foodservice operations have
now ceased in Australia.

Fuel

Revenue from our Fuel operations decreased by $1,193 million, or 10%, from $12,192 million for the six months ended June
30, 2022 to $10,999 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 driven by decreased revenue from the United States, Europe
(including Continental Europe and the United Kingdom and Ireland) and Australia.

The decrease in Fuel revenue in the United States, Europe and Australia was primarily due to lower average fuel retail prices
as a result of global oil prices normalizing after the highs experienced in 2022 caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and, in
the case of the United States, lower Fuel volumes sold. In Continental Europe, the decrease was partially offset by the six
months ended June 30, 2023 benefiting from the full consolidation for the entire period of the six months of results from the
OMV Acquisition whereas the six months ended June 30, 2022 only reflected the full consolidation of two months of OMV
financial results.


-----

_Cost of Sales_

Cost of sales decreased by $1,039 million, or 8%, from $13,124 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 to
$12,085 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to reduced cost of fuel compared to
higher underlying product purchase costs in 2022.

_Gross Profit_

Gross profit increased by $40 million, or 2%, from $2,093 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 to $2,133 million
for the six months ended June 30, 2023 primarily driven by growth in our Foodservice and Grocery & Merchandise operations.
The table below shows our gross profit for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2023, broken down by business stream and
geography:

**Six months ended** **Six months ended**

Grocery & Merchandise

Gross profit from our Grocery & Merchandise operations increased by $27 million, or 4%, from $640 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2022 to $667 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. This increase was primarily driven by new sites,
increased footfall and COCO conversions in Continental Europe, investment in new sites and Asda on the Move conversions
across the United Kingdom and Ireland, strong sales, mainly driven by pricing initiatives, in the United States, and unchanged
results in Australia, which were driven primarily by an increased mix of higher margin products, which was offset by declining
tobacco sales.

Foodservice

Gross profit from our Foodservice operations increased by $35 million, or 10%, from $354 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2022 to $389 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. This increase was driven primarily by the impact of
increased footfall and new store opening in Continental Europe, increased sales and pass through of cost price increases which
had a lag in 2022 for some brands, further supported by new site openings in the United Kingdom and Ireland, the closing of
underperforming food concessions, increased in-store Foodservice sales and increased overall profitability in the United States
and unchanged results in Australia.

Fuel

Gross profit from our Fuel operations decreased by $45 million, or 5%, from $993 million for the six months ended June 30,
2022 to $948 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. This decrease was driven by adverse inventory revaluations in
EG Fuel in Europe, highly competitive market conditions driving a reduction in fuel volumes sold, with price sensitive
consumers switching to lower price competitors in the United States and changes in market dynamics and consumer behavior
due to cost of living pressures in Australia, partially offset by a combination of new sites and the Asda Fuel proposition and
‘Asda On the Move’ conversions driving footfall at converted sites in the United Kingdom and Ireland, albeit at a slightly lower
fuel margin.

_Distribution Costs_

Distribution costs decreased by $32 million, or 2%, from $1,672 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 to
$1,640 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to a reduction in the calculated
impairment charge required for the six months ended June 30, 2023 of £101 million when compared to the six months ended
June 30, 2022 charge of $152 million. This reduction is then offset partially due to inflationary price increases.


-----

_Administrative Expenses_

Administrative expenses increased by $28 million, or 13%, from $209 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 to
$237 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to exceptional transaction costs totaling
$19 million booked in relation to dispositions, predominantly in relation to the UK Disposal to Asda and the U.S. Sale and
Leaseback, an increase of $18 million when compared to the prior period. In addition, the increase in the Group’s amortization
charge following the acquisition of OMV in May 2022, resulted in a further increase to administrative expenses of $7 million.

_Profit on disposal_

Profit on disposal increased $330 million from $2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 to $332 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to increased profits recognized on disposals in connection with
the U.S. Sale and Leaseback, resulting in an increase in $328 million.

_Other Operating Income_

Other operating income decreased by $48 million from $53 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 to $5 million for
the six months ended June 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to the one-off revaluation of a unfavorable contract
provision following the resolution of our dispute with Ampol in April 2022, which resulted in additional income of $43 million
recognized in 2022.

_Share of Profit of Equity Accounted Investments_

Share of profit of equity accounted investments decreased by $1 million from $1 million for the six months ended June 30,
2022 to nil for the six months ended June 30, 2023.

_Operating Profit/(Loss)_

Operating profit increased by $325 million, or 121%, from $268 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 to $593 million
for the six months ended June 30, 2023 due to the factors mentioned above.

_Finance Income_

Finance income increased by $175 million, or 170%, from $103 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 to $278 million
for the six months ended June 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to favorable foreign exchange movements relating to
the Group’s non-functional currency denominated loans and borrowings within the Groups subsidiaries.

_Finance Costs_

Finance costs increased by $196 million, or 56%, from $352 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 to $548 million
for the six months ended June 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to increases in the Group’s interest expense on variable
rate borrowings following the significant interest rate rises across the globe. In addition to this, the Group wrote off
approximately $31 million of capitalized finance costs in 2023 and incurred $23 million of debt modification costs, following
the completion of the Amend and Extend.

_Tax_

Tax increased by $11 million, or 12%, from $91 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 to $102 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to the increase in the Group’s profitability for the six months
ended June 30, 2022 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2023.

_Profit/(Loss) for the Period_

Profit/(loss) for the period increased by $293 million from loss of $72 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 to a
profit of $221 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 due to the factors mentioned above.

_Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16_

Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16 decreased by $65 million, or 10%, from $621 million for the six months ended June 30,
2022 to $556 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 due to decreases in the volumes of fuel sold and the profit margin
realized on fuel sales and fuel inventory revaluations related to EG Fuel’s Continental Europe distribution business. This


-----

decrease was also driven by various factors in each of our key geographic regions discussed below. The following table shows
our historical Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16 by region:

(2) Includes the impact of $79 million of shared service costs for the six months ended June 30, 2023.

Europe (Continental Europe and United Kingdom and Ireland)

In Continental Europe, Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16 decreased by $38 million, or 15%, from $261 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2022 to $223 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 due to adverse inventory revaluations
(specifically with respect to our fuel inventory) in EG Fuel. Excluding the impact of these adverse inventory revaluations,
Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16 increased by 14%.

In the United Kingdom and Ireland, Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16 increased by $33 million, or 27%, from $121 million
for the six months ended June 30, 2022 to $154 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 due to strong performance
across all business streams.

United States

In the United States, Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16 decreased by $38 million, or 16%, from $245 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2022 to $207 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 due to challenging market conditions impacting
fuel volumes and additional rent expense after the completion of the U.S. Sale and Leaseback in May 2023.

Australia

In Australia, Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16 decreased by $8 million, or 14%, from $59 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2022 to $51 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, primarily driven by a decrease in Fuel gross profit.

Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16 has also been adjusted for various exceptional items, which are presented and described in
further detail below:

-----

For the six months ended June 30, 2023

In the six months ended June 30, 2023, we recognized total exceptional items of $250 million. Transaction and acquisition
related costs of $19 million related to professional fees associated with the U.S. Sale and Leaseback and the UK Disposal to
Asda. Exceptional profit on disposal totaling $328 million related to the sale of a number of U.S. properties as part of the U.S.
Sale and Leaseback. Restructuring costs related to redundancy payments that were offered to employees with the aim to reduce
staff costs.

In April 2023, we committed to sell 19 company operated Minit Mart locations in Missouri and Kansas for consideration of
$21 million. In accordance with IFRS 5 ‘Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations’, the assets and
liabilities of these Minit Mart locations have been classified as a disposal group held for sale on our balance sheet. The goodwill
impairment of $4 million has been recognized prior to reclassification to held for sale as the carrying value of the disposal
group exceeded the fair value less cost to sell.

Exceptional finance costs totaling $54 million relate to capitalized finance costs expensed in the period, following the
refinancing of the Group’s term loans. This was made up of $31 million of capitalized finance costs written off in the period
following the renomination of the Group’s existing debt facilities, with a further $23 million of costs and fees expensed which
were associated with the amend and extend exercise. See “Summary—Recent Developments—Senior Credit Facilities
_Prepayment and Existing Notes Redemption.”_

For the six months ended June 30, 2022

In the six months ended June 30, 2022, we had transaction and acquisition related costs linked to professional fees associated
to historical acquisitions. Our exceptional litigation costs related to legal and professional fees.

The revaluation of unfavorable contract provision related to a reduction in the provisions recognized in relation to the contract
that we entered into with Ampol. On April 1 2022, we resolved our Federal Court proceedings with Ampol in Australia and in
resolving the dispute, the parties agreed updated commercial terms which resulted in a decrease in the carrying value of
provisions by $43 million. See “Business—Litigation.”

_Revenue_

Revenue increased by $4,196 million, or 16%, from $26,420 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to $30,616 million
for the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase was primarily due to the increase in fuel retail prices, which occurred
during the year ended December 31, 2022 as a result of the oil price volatility which occurred following Russia’s invasion of


-----

Ukraine, and the contribution of our recent acquisitions. The table below shows our revenue for the years ended December 31,
2021 and 2022, broken down by business stream and geography:

Other ............ 113 391 21 3 **528** 92 361 30 1 **484**

Grocery & Merchandise

Revenue from our Grocery & Merchandise operations decreased by $54 million, or 1%, from $4,484 million for the twelve
months ended December 31, 2021 to $4,430 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 driven by decreased
revenue from Europe (including Continental Europe and the United Kingdom and Ireland) and Australia, partially offset by
increased revenue from the United States.

The decrease in Grocery & Merchandise revenue in Europe and Australia was driven primarily by currency translation effects
and adverse foreign exchange rate movements. Grocery & Merchandise revenue from our United States operations increased
primarily due to due to the 2021 Sprint Acquisition, inflationary prices increases and promotional activity driving improved
footfall and from enhanced product mix.

Foodservice

Revenue from our Foodservice operations increased by $218 million, or 21%, from $1,062 million for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2021 to $1,280 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 driven by increased revenue from the
United States, Continental Europe and the United Kingdom and Ireland and Australia.

The increase in Foodservice revenue in Europe was driven primarily by increased opening hours and footfall versus as
compared to 2021, which was impacted by reduced operations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as our investment
in branded third-party foodservice outlets and inflationary price increases in our European operations. Foodservice revenue in
the United States increased primarily due to the 2021 Sprint Acquisition, inflationary price increases and the rollout of new
outlets and promotional activity to drive sales.

Fuel

Revenue from our Fuel operations increased by $4,076 million, or 20%, from $20,346 million for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2021 to $24,422 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 driven by increased revenue from the
United States, Europe (including Continental Europe and the United Kingdom and Ireland) and Australia.

The increase in Fuel revenue in Europe was primarily driven by the acquisition of 2021 OMV Acquisition and the increased
Fuel retail prices seen globally following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Increased Fuel revenue in the United States was also
primarily due to global increase of fuel retail prices. The increase in Fuel revenue in Australia was primarily driven by exiting
prolonged COVID-19 restrictions in early 2022 and increased Fuel retail prices in 2022 due to high wholesale fuel costs
throughout the year following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

_Cost of Sales_

Cost of sales increased by $3,939 million, or 18%, from $22,324 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to
$26,263 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, cost of sales increased
27%. This increase was primarily due to increased wholesale oil prices caused by ongoing geopolitical events following the
conflict in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, cost of sale increased 27%.


-----

_Gross Profit_

Gross profit increased by $257 million, or 6%, from $4,096 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to $4,353 million
for the year ended December 31, 2022. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, gross profit increased by 13%. The
table below shows our gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, broken down by business stream and
geography:

Grocery & Merchandise

Gross profit from our Grocery & Merchandise operations decreased by $13 million, or 1%, from $1,338 million for the year
ended December 31, 2021 to $1,325 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This decrease was primarily due to foreign
exchange movements in Continental Europe, the United Kingdom and Ireland and Australia and reduced lottery sales as a result
of reduced discretionary customer spending in the United Sates, partially offset by enhanced sales mix, including increased
beverage sales in the United States. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, Grocery & Merchandise gross profit
increased by 5% in Continental Europe, driven by increased footfall and improved sales mix of higher margin products, 10%
in the United Kingdom and Ireland driven by the increased sales linked to our ‘Asda on the Move’ initiative and 3% in Australia,
largely driven by improved product mix in our convenience retail offering.

Foodservice

Gross profit from our Foodservice operations increased by $91 million, or 15%, from $614 million for the year ended December
31, 2021 to $705 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. When translated at a constant currency rate, Foodservice gross
profit increased 28%. This increase was primarily driven by increased operating hours against the backdrop of reduced
operation in 2021 in some countries as part of the restrictions in place in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic in Continental
Europe. This increase was also driven by continued growth in our Foodservice operations in the United Kingdom and Ireland,
driven by ongoing site development during the year, including the opening of eight NTI forecourts, and by the annualized
impact of our U.K. Foodservice acquisitions made throughout 2021, as well as the rollout of eleven new Foodservice outlets
the United States during 2022.

Fuel

Gross profit from our Fuel operations increased by $175 million, or 9%, from $1,935 million for the year ended December 31,
2021 to $2,110 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. When translated at a constant currency rate, gross profit in the
United Kingdom and Ireland increased by 10% from 2021 to 2022, gross profit in Continental Europe increased by 13% from
2021 to 2022, with OMV contributing $64 million of Fuel gross profit in the year ended December 31, 2022, and gross profit
in Australia increased by 7% from 2021 to 2022. This increase was primarily driven by supportive fuel margins in all regions
(except Germany), which offset a reduction in volume resulting from volatile fuel market conditions, as higher prices impacted
volumes as price sensitive consumers moved to lower priced competitors, and increased fuel margins observed in the United
States as a result of such market volatility. In Germany, our fuel margins in the second half of 2022 were negatively impacted
by the impact of price indexing on our contracted fuel prices. This impact has not continued into 2023. The Sprint Acquisition
also contributed an additional $21 million of Fuel gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2022. These results were
partially offset by decreased gross profit in Continental Europe and Australia due to foreign exchange movements of the euro
and Australian dollar against the U.S. dollar.

_Distribution Costs_

Distribution costs increased by $409 million, or 14%, from $2,987 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to
$3,396 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, distribution costs


-----

increased by 19%. This increase was primarily due to the full year impact of the Group’s 2021 LEON Acquisition, Amsric
Acquisition, Cooplands Acquisition and Sprint Acquisition, which were completed in May 2021, September 2021, October
2021 and December 2021 respectively, and the OMV Acquisition which was completed in May 2022, as well as the weakening
of all translated currencies as compared to 2021 against the U.S. dollar. In addition to this, the Group’s impairment charge
booked on tangible fixed assets and right of use assets increased by $115 million due to adverse movements in the performance
of certain sites, together with increases to discount rates used when calculating the fair value of the sites from 2021 to 2022.

_Administrative Expenses_

Administrative expenses decreased by $19 million, or 3%, from $566 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to
$547 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, administrative expenses
increased by 9%. This increase was primarily due to inflationary pressures, including related to cost of living increases on head
office and regional salaries, as well as contractual increases and IT, and the continued investment in our shared service center.

_Other Operating Income_

Other operating income decreased by $14 million, or 17%, from $82 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to
$68 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This decrease was primarily due to the reduction in the exceptional profits
recognized on disposals of $67 million from 2021 to 2022, following the sale of a number of our sites in the United Kingdom
in 2021 following the outcome of the CMA’s review of our shareholders’ acquisition of Asda, which was partially offset by
the revaluation of an unfavorable contract provision following the resolution of our dispute with Ampol in April 2022, which
resulted in a decrease in the carrying value of provisions by $43 million.

_Share of Profit of Equity Accounted Investments_

Share of profit of equity accounted investments decreased by $2 million from a profit of $1 million for the year ended December
31, 2021 to a loss of $1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.

_Operating Profit/(Loss)_

Operating profit/(loss) decreased by $149 million, or 24%, from $626 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to $477
million for the year ended December 31, 2022 due to the factors mentioned above.

_Finance Income_

Finance income decreased by $296 million, or 91%, from $324 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to $28 million
for the year ended December 31, 2022. This decrease was primarily due to the reduced gain on retranslation of our nonfunctional currency borrowings, from a net gain of $256 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 to a net gain of $5
million in the year ended December 31, 2022. We also recorded interest income on our financial assets of $22 million for the
year ended December 31, 2022, compared to $66 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, with the decrease largely
driven by $41 million of income related to the reimbursement of costs by Bellis Property Newco Ltd in relation to the sterling
private placement notes which were agreed in March 2021 and subsequently redeemed in October 2021 (such notes, the
“Sterling Private Placement Notes”).

_Finance Costs_

Finance costs increased by $20 million, or 3%, from $743 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to $763 million for
the year ended December 31, 2022. Excluding exceptional items (comprising $15 million of debt extinguishment losses and
$41 million of transaction-related finance costs in the year ended December 31, 2021), net finance costs increased by
$316 million from $419 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to $735 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.
This increase was primarily due to an increase in interest expense on indebtedness bearing variable interest rates as a result of
interest rate increases in 2022. Finance costs are largely attributable to the costs to service the Existing Notes, term loans and
short-term borrowing facilities, in addition to interest on lease liabilities, the amortization of debt arrangement fees and nonutilization fees. Our external interest expense and debt servicing costs increased as a result of variable interest rate increases in
the year.


-----

_Tax_

Tax decreased by $89 million, or 58%, from $153 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to $64 million for the year
ended December 31, 2022, which represents an effective tax rate of (25)% as compared to 74% in the year ended December 31,
2021. This decrease in tax charge was primarily due to the reduction in earnings in the year.

_Profit/(Loss) for the Year_

Profit/(loss) for the year decreased by $376 million from a profit of $54 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to a loss
of $322 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 due to the factors mentioned above.

_Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16_

Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16 decreased by 5% to $1.36 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022 from $1.43 billion
for the year ended December 31, 2021, driven by the weakening of the euro, Australian dollar and pound sterling against the
U.S. dollar during the year. On a constant currency basis, our Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16 increased by 1.9% to $1.44
billion for the year ended December 31, 2022. The following table shows our historical Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16 by
region:

**Year ended** **Year ended**
**December 31, 2021** **December 31, 2022**

**Europe** **Europe**


**United** **United**

**Adjusted EBITDA**

**before IFRS 16 ...** 570 495 360 145 **1,429** 619 483 268 132 **1,356**

(1) Includes the impact of $141 million of shared service costs for the year ended December 31, 2021.

(2) Includes the impact of $146 million of shared service costs for the year ended December 31, 2022.

Europe (Continental Europe and United Kingdom and Ireland)

In Continental Europe, Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16 decreased by $12 million, or 2%, from $495 million for the year
ended December 31, 2021 to $483 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange
movements, Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16 increased by 11% for the period. Our European countries’ performances were
impacted by changes in consumer buying behavior, as well as the impact of negative currency movements due to the weakening
of the euro against the U.S. dollar.

In the United Kingdom and Ireland, Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16 decreased by $92 million, or 26%, from $360 million
for the year ended December 31, 2021 to $268 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Excluding the impact of foreign
exchange movements, Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16 decreased by 18% for the period. This decrease was primarily due
to the depreciation of the pound sterling against the U.S. dollar and inflationary cost pressures, particularly in Foodservice, in
addition to the negative impact of the increased hospitality VAT rate following the discontinuation of the reduced rate
introduced during COVID-19.

United States

In the United States, Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16 increased by $49 million, or 9%, from $570 million for the year ended
December 31, 2021 to $619 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase was largely driven by increased fuel
gross profit, promotional activity driving improved footfall, the impact of the 2021 Sprint acquisition and enhanced product
mix.

Australia

In Australia, Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16 decreased by $13 million, or 9%, from $145 million for the year ended
December 31, 2021 to $132 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This decrease was primarily due to the weakening
of the Australian dollar against the U.S. dollar.

Total exceptional items .......................................................................................................................................... **(75)** **(74)**

For the year ended December 31, 2022

Transaction and acquisition-related costs of $7 million relate to professional fees associated with the OMV Acquisition and
also further costs in relation to historical acquisitions.

Litigation costs of $2 million relate to legal and professional fees regarding federal court proceedings with Ampol Limited
(“Ampol”).

Revaluation of unfavorable contract provision of $43 million relates to a reduction in the provisions recognized in relation to
the contract that we entered into with Ampol. On April 1, 2022, we resolved our federal court proceedings with Ampol. In
resolving the dispute, we and Ampol agreed updated commercial terms which resulted in a decrease in the carrying value of
provisions by $43 million.

Restructuring costs of $2 million relate to legal and professional fees incurred by us regarding a project to rationalize intercompany debt balances.

Profit on disposal of $5 million is predominantly in relation to the sale of a number of German sites which were disposed of
following the outcome of the German Anti-Trust Authorities’ review of our acquisition of the OMV sites, resulting in a $3
million profit on disposal. We were required to divest a number of PFS sites within six months of the acquisition completing
to address local competition concerns. Additionally, in November 2022, we completed the divestment of GB3 Limited and its
parent company Urban Origin Limited, recognizing a profit on disposal of $1 million.

The impairment reversal of $1 million recognized in the year relates to the reversal of a previously recognized exceptional
impairment charge, where operational performance development plans have been implemented and the site level performance
was sufficient to support the increased carrying value.

Following the completion of the goodwill impairment review, an impairment has been recognized in relation to the Australian
group of cash-generating units of $100 million.

For the year ended December 31, 2021

Acquisition and transaction-related costs within operating profit of $14 million predominantly relate to directly attributable
incremental costs incurred as a result of our growth acquisitions, and largely relate to professional and legal fees.


-----

Litigation costs relate to legal and professional fees regarding federal court proceedings with Ampol.

Contingent consideration release of $5 million reflects the release of the contingent consideration relating to the acquisition of
Certified Oil, an acquisition in the United States which completed in 2019, where the criteria for payment were not met.

Exceptional restructuring credit of $2 million relates to the release of a provision recognized in 2018 through exceptionals
regarding the restructuring of the management and support teams in Continental Europe.

The profit on disposal in the year is in relation to the sale of a number of UK sites sold following the outcome of the CMA’s
review of the shareholders’ acquisition of Asda. We were required to divest a number of PFS sites by the end of 2021.

The exceptional impairment charge in the year relates to the $19 million intangible impairment of the Tom Thumb brand name,
and the $3 million impairment of property, plant and equipment, both in the United States. The impairment reversal of $7
million recognized in the year relates to the reversal of a previously recognized exceptional impairment charge, where
operational performance development plans were implemented and the site level performance was sufficient to support the
increased carrying value.

Following the completion of the goodwill impairment review, an impairment was recognized in relation to the Australian group
of cash-generating units of $100 million.

The transaction-related finance costs relate to the financing costs which were directly incurred in relation to the Sterling Private
Placement Notes. The finance income from recharged finance costs reflects the reimbursement of these transaction-related
finance costs by Bellis Property Newco Ltd, a related party of the Group.

Following the refinancing of our revolving credit facility, letter of credit facilities and second lien facilities during the year
ended December 31, 2021, the existing arrangement fees which had been capitalized onto the balance sheet have been expensed
in the year. Furthermore, financing costs were incurred in relation to the Sterling Private Placement Notes which were agreed
in the year; however, as this facility was terminated as a result of the aborted Asda forecourt acquisition in 2021, these costs
were expensed as exceptional.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

Our Group Treasury function manages our liquidity and capital resources activities. Historically, our principal sources of funds
have been cash generated from our operating activities and borrowings under our Senior Credit Facilities, including our
Revolving Credit Facilities, and the Existing Indentures. Our principal uses of cash are to fund debt service obligations, working
capital and capital expenditures and, historically, had been to complete acquisitions. As of June 30, 2023, we had cash and cash
equivalents of $1,423 million (not including $139 million of cash held for sale, primarily related to the UK Disposal to Asda).
Following the UK Disposal to Asda and the Conditions Satisfaction Date, commitments under the Revolving Credit Facilities
will be $378 million (equivalent) and commitments under our Letter of Credit Facilities will be $638 million (equivalent).
Drawings under the Revolving Credit Facilities are available in U.S. dollars, euro and pound sterling. The Letter of Credit
Facilities operate as a committed bank guarantee facility, which is regularly utilized to provide credit support for fuel purchases
and rental obligations. Group Treasury is actively redirecting this activity toward the surety bond market. See “Description of
_Certain Financing Arrangements—Senior Credit Facilities Agreement.”_

Our principal source of liquidity on an ongoing basis is expected to be our operating cash flows and borrowings under our
Revolving Credit Facilities and Letter of Credit Facilities. Our ability to generate cash depends on our future operating
performance, which, in turn, depends to some extent on general economic, financial, industry and other factors, many of which
are beyond our control. See “Risk Factors.”

Although we believe that our expected cash flows from operations, together with available borrowings under our Revolving
Credit Facilities, will be adequate to meet our anticipated working capital and general corporate needs for the next twelve
months, we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities or that future debt
financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, including the Notes, or to fund
our other liquidity needs. The availability of our Revolving Credit Facilities is dependent upon conditions, including ongoing
compliance with a maintenance covenant tested quarterly as described further under “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Senior Credit Facilities Agreement.”_


-----

**Cash Management**

Our middle office, which is a part of our Group treasury function and which manages our liquidity on a daily basis, is comprised
of a team of four in Blackburn, a regional treasury of two in the United States and a cash manager in each of Australia, Germany
and Italy. The introduction of CashForce, our new treasury management system, benefits our near- to medium-term liquidity
analysis to minimize any call on the Revolving Credit Facility, with surplus cash invested in AAA government backed money
market accounts in either the United States or the United Kingdom. In terms of cash flow, the biggest outflows are seen at
quarter end, when monthly outflows such as salary, VAT & customs & excise payments are supplemented with quarterly
outflows of interest expense and bank fees.

**Cash Flows**

The following table sets forth our as reported consolidated statement of cash flows for the periods indicated.

**Year ended** **Six months ended**

**_Cash Flows from Operating Activities_**

_Comparison of the Six Months Ended June 30, 2022 and 2023_

Net cash flows from operating activities increased by $25 million, or 4%, from $562 million for the six months ended June 30,
2022 to $587 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to positive cashflow contributions
following the OMV Acquisition which was acquired in May 2022, with the six months ended June 30, 2023 benefitting from
the consolidation of this business for a complete six months period. In addition to this, fuel price reductions since the year end
have resulted in a reduction in the amount of our cash being tied up within working capital in 2023, with the 2022 working
capital movement reflecting the opposite trend.

_Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2022_

Net cash flows from operating activities decreased by $242 million, or 17%, from $1,455 million for the year ended
December 31, 2021 to $1,213 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This decrease was primarily due to the significant
increases in fuel prices, which resulted in more of our cash being tied up within working capital. In addition, our tax paid also
increased significantly year-on-year, primarily driven by an exceptional tax paid in 2022 in relation to the disposal of our fuel
card business in 2019.

**_Cash Flows used in/from Investing Activities_**

_Comparison of the Six Months Ended June 30, 2022 and 2023_

Net cash flows from investing activities increased by $1,800 million, or 395%, from net cash used in investing activities of
$456 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 to $1,344 million of net cash from investing activities for the six months
ended June 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to the cash inflow following the completion of the U.S. Sale and
Leaseback transaction in 2023, with net proceeds totaling $1.4 billion. The increase is further compounded as the cash outflow
relating to the completion of the OMV Acquisition for $454 million was included in the comparative period.


-----

_Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2022_

Net cash flows used in investing activities decreased by $809 million from $1,530 million for the year ended December 31,
2021 to $721 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This decrease was primarily due to the impact of a financial asset
which was acquired in 2021 resulting in a $243 million outflow and the subsequent disposal of this financial asset in 2022
resulting in a $231 million inflow. In addition, this decrease is related to the payment of the consideration for the OMV
Acquisition in 2022, which was financed in 2021.

**_Cash Flows used in/from Financing Activities_**

_Comparison of the Six Months Ended June 30, 2022 and 2023_

Net cash flows used in financing activities increased by $498 million, or 160%, from $312 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2022 to $810 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. This increase was primarily driven by a reduction in the
proceeds from new borrowings totaling $316 million as the Group did not make any significant acquisitions in 2023 in
comparison to multiple acquisitions in 2022, an increase in interest paid on variable rate borrowings totaling $71 million due
to increases in the SONIA, EURIBOR and SOFR variable borrowing rates and an increase in the repayment of borrowings of
$80m as the Group repaid RCF facilities. Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2022

Net cash flows from financing activities were $93 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to net cash used
in financing activities of $579 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This change was primarily due to the additional
borrowings to finance the LEON Acquisition and the Amsric Acquisition in the year ended December 31, 2021 and the funding
of the OMV Acquisition in the year ended December 31, 2022 with financing that was raised in the year ended December 31,
2021.

**Working Capital**

We typically have been a cash generative business, which supports ongoing activities of the group including budgeted and
forecast (in CashForce) capital expenditure for both maintenance and growth. Our Group initiatives to reduce working capital
costs include (i) extending credit terms, particularly from fuel suppliers, (ii) reducing inventory and associated holding cost
and (iii) limiting capital expenditure. Working capital is supplemented at times when required with RCF borrowings under a
committed facility.

The table below sets forth a summary of cash movements in our working capital for the periods indicated, derived from our
consolidated cash flow statements:

**Year ended** **Six months ended**
**December 31,** **June 30,**

**2021** **2022** **2022** **2023**
**(in $ million)**
(Increase)/Decrease in inventories ........................................................................... (132) (79) (124) 55
(Increase)/Decrease in receivables ........................................................................... (18) (63) (205) 5
Increase/(Decrease) in payables .............................................................................. 84 (12) 217 (43)

**Cash movements in working capital ....................................................................** **(66)** **(154)** **(112)** **17**

Cash inflows from movements in working capital amounted to $17 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, and was
primarily driven by timing of supplier payments.

Cash outflow from movements in working capital amounted to $(154) million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and was
primarily driven by timing differences with an increase in inventories held. Transactional activity levels remained broadly
consistent in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, however fuel prices have
been consistently higher in 2022 than 2021, due to rising wholesale costs, which has resulted in increases across all components
of working capital. In the year ended December 31, 2022, inventories increased to $842 million from $772 million in the year
ended December 31, 2021, current trade and other payables increased to $1,799 million from $1,672 million in the year ended
December 31, 2021 and current trade and other receivables increased to $676 million from $547 million in the year ended
December 31, 2021.

Cash outflow from changes in working capital amounted to $(66) million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and was
primarily driven by timing differences with an increase in receivables and inventory held and decreased payables.


-----

**Capital Expenditures**

Our capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022 and the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2023
relate primarily to (i) the refurbishment, change in the operating model and rebranding of some of our existing sites, (ii) rollout programs, (iii) new-to-industry sites, (iv) the acquisition of new sites and new businesses and the integration of our newly
acquired sites into our existing brands and formats, (v) the maintenance of our network and (vi) the knock-down and rebuilding
of existing sites.

The table below sets forth our capital expenditures for the periods presented. None of the metrics set forth in the table below is
a measurement of our financial performance under IFRS and should not be considered as alternatives to financial information
presented in accordance with IFRS. We present these non-IFRS measures because we believe that they and similar measures
are widely used by certain investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measures of performance
and liquidity. The non-IFRS measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and have
limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results
as reported under IFRS. You should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our financial statements and using
these non-IFRS financial measures only supplementally to evaluate our performance. See “Presentation of Financial and Other
_Information—Presentation of Financial Information—Non-IFRS Financial Measures.”_

(1) We define maintenance capital expenditure as capital expenditure required to maintain the performance of our network.

(2) Includes the United Kingdom and Ireland, before giving effect to the UK Disposal to Asda.

(3) We define growth capital expenditure as consisting of (i) Capital Expenditure on Acquired Sites, defined as capital expenditure on the integration of
newly acquired sites into our existing brands and formats, including with respect to rebranding our acquired sites, (ii) Capital Expenditure on New Sites,
defined as capital expenditure on new sites, such as new-to-industry sites and new highway PFS sites, including with respect to rolling out non-fuel
offerings at these sites and (iii) Capital Expenditure on Existing Sites, defined as capital expenditure on existing sites, including the refurbishment of
existing sites, including extensions, minor refits of our existing PFS sites, the change in the operating model of some of our existing sites and the
rebranding of our existing sites.

(4) Total capital expenditure represents the total cash paid for the purchases of property, plant and equipment and cash paid for the purchases of intangibles.

Capital expenditures for the six months ended June 30, 2023 were $200 million, a decrease of $20 million, or 9%, from
$220 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. Capital expenditures for the six months ended June 30, 2023 were
primarily related to NTI sites in the United Kingdom and Ireland, the United States and Continental Europe and store refits and
branding updates across the Group.

Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2022 were $520 million, a decrease of $90 million, or 15%, from
$610 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Capital expenditures in Europe totaled $284 million and included the
building of the eight NTI sites and significant investment in developing our Foodservice offering and acquiring land for future
development in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Over 70% of the capital expenditures in Continental Europe (excluding the
United Kingdom and Ireland) were spent on the growth of our network, with three NTI sites in the year, 52 COCO conversions
and nine new Foodservice outlets. Capital expenditures in the United States totaled $199 million and consisted of $130 million
of growth capital expenditures which included investment in 13 NTI sites and land bank acquisitions. Capital expenditure for
Australia totaled $37 million and included the store refresh program and the addition of seven NTI sites.

Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $610 million. We saw an increase in growth capital
expenditures as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 following the controlled reduction of growth capital
expenditures implemented in 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Capital expenditures in the United Kingdom and
Ireland totaled $174 million and included the building of 14 NTI sites, significant investment made in acquiring land for future


-----

development and investment in developing our Foodservice offering. Continental European (non-United Kingdom and Ireland)
capital expenditure totaled $78 million with over 40% of this amount being spent on maintenance of our sites and the remainder
largely focused on knock-down-rebuilds and Foodservice rollouts. United States capital expenditures totaled $194 million
which included site maintenance expenditure and investment in seven NTI sites and land bank acquisitions. Capital expenditure
for Australia totaled $76 million and included the store refresh program, four NTI sites and investment in IT systems following
the transition of its systems and process from the transition services agreement with Woolworths.

Our capital expenditure requirements vary from year to year based on, among other factors, different capital intensity in
different operations and markets, specific reinvestment requirements in relation to our sites and specific initiatives to develop
our technologies, and as such, we cannot assure you that our level of capital expenditure will not increase significantly in the
future. Following the Transactions, we expect our adjusted free cash flow to be impacted by our interest expenses, cash taxes
and the payment of deferred indirect taxes (which are payable on a straight line basis until September 2027) and we expect our
annual maintenance capital expenditure to be in the range of $110 million to $130 million in the near term. We continue to
focus on free cash flow generation as part of our revised financial policy and so we assess our discretionary growth capital
requirements on an ongoing basis to ensure the expenditure we incur is within the remaining free cash flow available to the
Group.

**Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements**

Our off-balance sheet liabilities relate primarily to bank-issued guarantees. As of June 30, 2023, we recorded expense of
$7 million for bank-issued guarantees.

Except as described above, we are not party to any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have,
a current or future material effect on our financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital
expenditure or capital resources.

**Hedging**

Group Treasury actively manages foreign exchange risk and has recruited a dedicated Front Office Risk Manager to support
this activity. Most foreign exchange activity historically has been accommodated with spot trades for liquidity purposes.
Forward contracts are more regularly used in M&A transactions to mitigate potential exchange rate movement between
signature and completion of either a significant acquisition or disposal, including in connection with the UK Disposal to Asda
on a deal contingent basis where we have hedged substantial sales proceeds in pound sterling to provide certainty of debt
prepayments due in U.S. dollar, euro and Australian dollar.

Where we consider necessary, we may also use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the exposure we have servicing
debt held by certain our subsidiaries with a different functional currency than the currency of such debt instrument. See “—
_Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk—Foreign Currency Risk”._

While we may enter into additional hedging agreements in the future, we may also elect not to do so or the terms on which we
hedge may not be satisfactory or may fail to adequately protect us from changes in foreign exchange rates or interest rates.

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk**

In the ordinary course of business, we are exposed to a variety of market risks including market risk (including foreign currency
risk and interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. We monitor and manage these risks as a part of our overall risk
management. The following section discusses the significant financial risks to which we are exposed. This discussion does not
address other risks to which we are exposed in the ordinary course of business, such as operational risks. For further detail, see
Note 34 to the 2022 EG Group Audited Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

**_Interest Rate Risk_**

Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in
market interest rates. Certain of our credit facilities bear interest at variable rates and therefore our earnings and cash flow are
subject to fluctuation from changes in the applicable benchmark rate. Increases in short-term interest rates will increase debt
service requirements and reduce earnings and net cash flows. Hedging activities are evaluated regularly to align with interest
rate views and a defined risk appetite, ensuring the most cost-effective hedging strategies are applied.

In light of the present uncertainty over the outlook of interest rates, we have hedged against potential scenarios where interest
rates move further higher beyond current expectations through a combination of interest rate caps and swaps. Interest rate caps


-----

provide us, in exchange for a premium cost, with an insurance against interest rate increases by providing a pay-out if rates go
above an agreed strike rate. If rates stay lower than the strike rate, we continue to benefit from the lower market floating rate.
We have entered into interest rate caps against both our floating rate Euro and U.S. dollar exposure. Specifically, €850 million
of our floating rate Euro debt is capped at a strike rate of 4% for two years ending 30[th] September 2025 and $1.1 billion of our
floating rate U.S. dollar exposure is capped at a strike 5.5% for two years ending 30 September 2025. We are also evaluating
the addition of interest rate swaps, which would allow us to lock in the average rate of the prevailing interest rate forward curve
for the tenor of the hedge and therefore provide more certainty of cash flows. While we may enter into additional hedging
agreements in the future, we may also elect not to do so or the terms on which we hedge may not be satisfactory or may fail to
adequately protect us from changes in interest rates.

The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the interest rate exposure for both derivative and non-derivative
instruments at the balance sheet date of December 31. For floating rate liabilities, the analysis below is prepared on the
assumption that the liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the full year. A 100 basis point increase
or decrease represents management’s assessment of a reasonably possible change in interest rates. If interest rates had been
100 basis points higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, our profit and other equity for the year would be
impacted as follows:

**Income statement** **Equity**
**2022** **2021** **2022** **2021**
**(in $ millions)**
**Variable rate borrowings ........................................................................................** **+/-70** **+/-53** **+/-70** **+/-53**
**+/-70** **+/-53** **+/-70** **+/-53**

**_Credit Risk_**

Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to us. Credit
risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, deposits with banks and financial institutions, derivatives in an asset position, as
well as credit exposures to wholesale and retail customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions. Sales
to retail customers are settled in cash or using major credit cards. In the year ended December 31, 2022, we had unsecured
trade and other receivables of $768 million (compared to $639 million in 2021) and cash and cash equivalents of $466 million
(compared to $646 million in 2021), reflecting our maximum exposure to credit risk. These receivables are normally settled
when due and are spread across a number of counterparties so the likelihood of material losses arising as a result of this exposure
is considered insignificant for the reasons set out below.

Our trade receivable balances comprise a number of individually small amounts from unrelated customers, over a number of
geographical areas. Concentration of risk is therefore limited.

We have adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties and obtaining sufficient collateral where
appropriate, as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults. We regularly monitor our exposure and the credit
ratings of our counterparties, taking into account, among other factors, the financial position of customers, our past experience
and other factors.

We have no significant concentration of credit risk. The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is
limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.

**_Liquidity Risk_**

Liquidity risk is the risk of not being able to fulfill present or future obligations if we do not have sufficient funds available to
meet such obligations at the time they become due. Liquidity risk arises mostly in relation to cash flows generated and used in
working capital and from financing activities, particularly by servicing our debt, in terms of both interest and principal, and our
payment obligations relating to our ordinary business activities.

Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board, which we believe has established an appropriate
liquidity risk management framework for the management of our short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity
management requirements. We manage liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve
borrowing facilities, by regularly monitoring forecast and actual cash flows, and by matching the maturity profiles of financial
assets and liabilities.


-----

**_Market risk_**

Our activities expose us primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates (see
“—Foreign Currency Risk”). We enter into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate
and foreign currency risk, including forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on purchase of
fuel in U.S. dollars by our European subsidiaries.

We have not applied cash flow hedge accounting on forward foreign exchange contracts.

**_Foreign Currency Risk_**

Our results of operations are subject to foreign currency translation and transaction effects because we have operations in
Australia, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States, which
are and will be conducted primarily in the respective local currency, and because we source products from suppliers worldwide.
As we present our consolidated financial statements in U.S. dollars, we must translate the assets, liabilities, revenue and
expenses of all of our operations with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars at then-applicable
exchange rates. Consequently, increases or decreases in the value of these currencies against the U.S. dollar may affect the
value of our assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses with respect to our non-euro businesses in our consolidated financial
statements, even if their value has not changed in their original currency, which creates translation risk.

We are mainly exposed to the euro in relation to the servicing of euro-denominated debt held by our subsidiaries with a sterling
functional currency and the servicing of U.S. dollar-denominated debt held by our subsidiaries with a sterling functional
currency.

The Dollar Notes will be denominated in U.S. dollars and the Euro Notes will be denominated in euro, and changes in foreign
exchange rates will therefore give rise to foreign exchange exposure with respect to the Euro Notes.

The following table details our sensitivity to a 10% increase and decrease in sterling against the euro and sterling against the
U.S. dollar. 10% represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates. The
sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the
year-end for a 10% change in foreign currency rates. The sensitivity analysis includes external loans as well as loans to foreign
operations within the Group where the denomination of the loan is in a currency other than the currency of the lender or the
borrower. A positive number below indicates an increase in profit and other equity where the functional currency strengthens
10% against the relevant foreign currency. For a 10% weakening of the functional currency against the relevant foreign
currency, there would be a comparable impact on the profit and other equity, and the balances below would be negative.

**Income statement** **Equity**
**2022** **2021** **2022** **2021**
**(in $ millions)**
**EUR:GBP ................................................................................................................................** **266** **369** **266** **369**
**USD:GBP .................................................................................................................................** **(124)** **(140)** **—** **—**

We believe a change in exchange rate of 10% of U.S. dollars against sterling, euro or Australian dollars would be offset against
the foreign currency translation within equity. The table above therefore does not show the impact of the translation of foreign
subsidiaries into presentational currency. A 10% change in U.S. dollars against sterling at year end would have an impact of
$22 million on equity, a 10% change in U.S. dollars against euro at year end would have an impact of $12 million on equity,
and a 10% change in U.S. dollars against Australian dollars at year end would have an impact of $89 million on equity.

Where we consider necessary, we use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge these exposures. While we may enter into
additional hedging agreements in the future, we may also elect not to do so or the terms on which we hedge may not be
satisfactory or may fail to adequately protect us from changes in foreign exchange rates.

**Significant Accounting Judgements and Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty**

In the application of our accounting policies, we are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are
based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these
estimates.


-----

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized
in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future
periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.

In preparing the EG Group Unaudited Financial Statements, the significant judgements made by management in applying the
Group’s accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those that applied to the 2022 EG
Group Audited Financial Statements with the exception of the judgements exercised in respect to the U.S. Sale and Leaseback
which took place in the three months ended June 30, 2023, the Amend and Extend and the UK Disposal to Asda, as described
in footnote 1 to the EG Group Unaudited Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

**_Significant judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies_**

In the process of applying our accounting policies, we have made the following judgements that have the most significant effect
on the amounts recognized in the financial statements (apart from those involving estimations, which are dealt with below) and
have been identified as being particularly complex or involve subjective assessments.

_Exceptional Items_

We consider that an adjusted profit measure provides useful information for the underlying trends, performance and position
of the Group. These measures are consistent with how business performance is measured internally by the board of directors.
Profit before exceptionals is not a recognized measure under IFRS and may not be directly comparable with adjusted measures
used by other companies.

We exercise judgement in determining the items to classify as exceptional items. This assessment considers the nature of the
item, cause of occurrence and the scale of impact of that item on reported performance. Reversals of previous exceptional items
are recognized as exceptional items. We exercise judgement in ensuring there is an equal focus by management in classifying
both expenses and revenue items as exceptional.

_Indefinite Life Brands_

The brands of Cumberland Farms and Cooplands are well-known long-standing brands in the United States and in the United
Kingdom and Ireland, respectively, and as a result of the reputation and association with quality there is no foreseeable limit
to the period over which the asset is expected to generate net cash inflows. The brands are therefore deemed to have, as of the
year ended December 31, 2022, an indefinite useful economic life and the values of $337 million and $20 million, respectively,
will not be amortized, but will be assessed for impairment annually.

**_Key sources of estimation uncertainty_**

The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have
a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial
year, are discussed below.

_Impairment of Property, Plant and Equipment and Intangibles_

Property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount may not be recoverable. In performing the review, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that is
largely independent of our other cash-generating streams.

Goodwill and indefinite life brands are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis. We allocate goodwill to groups of cashgenerating units, where each country represents a group of cash-generating units.

When a review for impairment is conducted, the recoverable amounts for cash-generating units are the higher of fair value less
cost of disposal, and value-in-use. In assessing value-in-use, the estimated future cash flows (which is a key source of estimation
uncertainty) are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the
time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.

Fair value is determined based on forecast earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”, which is
a non-IFRS measure) and EBITDA valuation multiples of comparable corporations and market transactions. For the purpose
of the impairment test, management uses estimates and assumptions to establish the fair value of our cash-generating units. If
these assumptions and estimates prove to be incorrect, the carrying value of the goodwill may be overstated.


-----

_Fair Values in Business Combinations_

In assessing the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations, estimation is used in a number of areas.
To assist in this work, we engage external valuation experts to assess the fair value. Management then reviews the work and
assess the results.

_Measurement of provisions_

We recognize provisions for liabilities when it is more likely than not that a settlement will be required and the value of such a
payment can be reliably estimated. Contingent liabilities identified through business combinations are recognized on the
balance sheet as provisions in accordance with IFRS 3. In the year ended December 31, 2022, we have recognized provisions
totaling $691 million (compared to $839 million in 2021) for environmental costs, dilapidations and onerous contracts. The
provision for environmental costs and dilapidations is based on the current cost escalated at an inflation rate and discounted at
a risk-free rate. The provision for onerous contracts is based on the lower of our current estimates of cost of fulfilling the
contracts and any compensation or penalties and discounting to present value when the effect of time value of money is material.
These provisions are estimates and the actual costs and timing of future cash flows are dependent on future events and market
conditions.

Because actual outflows can differ from estimates due to changes in laws, regulations, prices and conditions, the carrying
amounts of provisions are regularly reviewed and adjusted to take account of such changes.

Any difference between expectations and the actual future liability will be accounted for in the period when such determination
is made. The carrying amount of provisions will be impacted by changes in the discount rate.

For further details of these significant accounting judgements and key Sources of estimation uncertainty, see Note 3 to the 2022
EG Group Audited Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

**INDUSTRY**
**Overview**

The global C-Store industry has three primary components: retail fuel, grocery & merchandise, and foodservice. The industry
is large and highly fragmented, and in recent years has experienced a number of divestitures and consolidation from major fuel
producers and/or refiners, grocery retailers, independent operators and chains. Chain stores generate the majority of fuel sales
in the C-Store industry. Although there are fewer sites, chain stores can sell more than three times the number of gallons per
month than smaller operators. Fuel offerings are the predominant driver of C-Store traffic. Historical and projected retail fuel
volumes and margins remain relatively stable across all geographies that we operate in. In more recent years, C-Stores have
improved the range of non-fuel products and services, such as grocery & merchandise and Foodservice products and services,
they offer in order to appeal to the increasingly “time-strapped” consumer. C-Store operators seek to provide these customers,
such as families with limited time for traditional shopping, with “one-stop” shopping solutions. Grocery & merchandise, and
foodservice products and services remain attractive, are expected to grow at positive rates and, generally are not threatened by
the growth of online retailers, for which sales of individual convenience retail products are less profitable. The pandemic
accelerated a customer trend towards convenience shopping and home delivery, but even beyond the pandemic, as customer
behavior has transitioned to more hybrid routines, convenience is a critical factor, particularly in the grocery and foodservice
sector.

**Fuel**

Historically, the retail fuel market has been stable, with fuel volumes growing at a moderate rate before the COVID-19
pandemic in the countries where we operate. The different geographic markets in which we operate are at various stages of
development. In particular, in the most developed markets, larger players have optimized their networks and site rationalization
has occurred, leading to an increase in average throughput per site and enhanced profitability. In addition, major fuel producers
and/or refiners and grocery retailers, which have historically held a significant share of the fuel retail market, continue to
refocus their core operations away from retail fuel services, giving rise to consolidation opportunities.

We expect fuel volumes within our current operating geographies to decrease slightly in the near future, largely driven by
anticipated vehicle efficiency improvements and an decline in average vehicle travel distance, which we believe is due to
changing consumer behavior after the COVID pandemic (i.e., greater tendency towards at-home behaviors including working
and eating meals at home). This decline is expected to be partially offset by structurally higher fuel unit margin profitability,
measured in cents per liter or gallon, and increased European vehicle fleet.

**Grocery & Merchandise and Foodservice**

In 2022, in the countries in which we currently operate, the grocery & merchandise market had sales of €260 billion and the
foodservice market had sales of €948 billion. These growing and attractive industries have benefited from positive trends,
notably emerging consumer trends and limited exposure to internet encroachment. These consumer trends include increases in
food consumption away from home, dual-income families, “on-the-go” meal solutions and increases in the number of cars on
the road. Foodservice and forecourt operators have in turn looked to upgrade their offerings, providing restaurant-quality food
to appeal to an increasingly time-strapped consumer looking for convenient solutions. Changing consumer habits have also
enabled fuel operators to expand their offerings, remain high-margin and increase profitability. The overall quality of
foodservice and forecourt operators’ offerings have improved as they look to differentiate and drive higher-margin inside sales,
diversifying from an industry that was historically dependent on lower margin tobacco and beverage sales. This increase in
quality of the offerings is forecasted to lead to continued margin growth across all of our geographies from 2022 to 2027. All
figures related to the development of the grocery & merchandise and foodservice markets are quoted from Euromonitor
International, Retail 2023 edition, extracted in September 2023. Unless otherwise stated, all value data citations are in retail
value (retail selling price excluding sales tax), in million euros (current terms), at a fixed 2022 exchange rate. In addition, data

**Electric Vehicles (EV)**

The Company also operates in the growing market for electric vehicles through its deployment of EV charging points. C-Stores
globally began to start install EV chargers over a decade ago and have continued to deploy EV chargers since. During that time,
the market for Evs has experienced growth, with 10 million Evs sold in 2022. This figure represents 14% of all new car sales
in 2022, up from 9% in 2021 and less than 5% in 2020. Globally, China, Europe and the United States represent the largest
markets for Evs. EV sales in Europe increased by more than 15% in 2022, with Evs representing more than 20% of all new
cars sold in the continent. EV sales in the United States increased 55% in 2022, representing 8% of new cars sold in the country.
Global EV sales in the first quarter of 2023 were 25% higher than the year prior, representing strong growth and supporting
estimates of 14 million EV sales for the year, a 35% year-on-year increase.

The strong growth in the EV industry is supported by robust support from government policies in all major markets, with the
European Union and the United States both passing supportive legislation in recent years. The European Union has adopted
new CO2 standards for cars and vans aligned with its “Fit for 55” ambitions, which seeks to reduce emissions by at least 55%
by 2030. In the United States, the Inflation Reduction Act, California’s Advanced Clean Cars II rule, and recently proposed
emissions standards from the Environmental Protection Agency all support the country’s target of 50% market share for Evs
by 2030. Despite widespread support from a policy perspective, EV penetration faces headwinds caused by consumers buying
fewer new vehicles than in the past. The average age of cars and light trucks on the road in the United States increased to an
all-time high of 12.5 years in 2023, up from 9.7 years in 2003, due to greater efficiency and engineering in existing vehicle
fleets, and depressed consumer demand for new vehicles due to higher interest rates and levels of inflation.

Regarding charging infrastructure, public charging points are becoming increasingly necessary to support and enable wider EV
uptake. Specifically, publicly accessible fast chargers along highways can enable longer journeys and address range anxiety
among drivers. At the end of 2022, there were 2.7 million public charging points worldwide, of which more than 900,000 were
installed in 2022, representing a 55% increase from 2021 and in-line with the pre-pandemic growth rate of 50% between 2015
and 2019. In 2022, the supply of publicly accessible fast chargers increased by 330,000 globally, the majority of which were
in China. In Europe, there were over 70,000 publicly accessible fast chargers as of the 2022, an increase of around 55% as
compared to 2021. An agreement between the European Investment Bank and the European Commission will make over
€1.5 billion available for alternative fuels infrastructure, including fast chargers, by the end of 2023. Throughout the United

States, there were 6,300 fast chargers installed in 2022, of which roughly three-quarters were Tesla Superchargers. These
additions bring the total U.S. fast charger stock to 28,000, with further acceleration in deployment expected through the
National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program, a program established by the U.S. Infrastructure Investment and
Jobs Act of 2021 to provide funding to U.S. states to, among other things, strategically deploy EV charging infrastructure. As
EV penetration continues to grow and with investments expected to accelerate, C-Stores, with convenient places for publicly
accessible chargers, are expected to be well-suited for the transition to electric charging points.

**_The United States_**

The U.S. market is the largest convenience retailer market in the world with approximately 150,200 sites that sell fuel. The
U.S. market is very fragmented, with few operators with leading market position only in certain regions and approximately
60% of convenience stores owned by single store operators. The top 15 chains account for 36% of total U.S. sites and are
growing share primarily through acquisitions in an increasingly consolidated market. The majority of convenience retailers
have a forecourt fuel offering, selling 514 billion liters in 2022 and processing 160 million transactions per day. The U.S. fuel
market has a long track record of growing USD cents per liter, which is expected to offset any modest future volume declines.
The position of the National Association on Convenience Stores position on U.S. fuel demand includes some system-wide
decline due to the adoption of Evs and alternate energy sources. Improved fuel efficiency is expected to be the main catalyst
for declines in fuel demand.

The U.S. grocery & merchandise and foodservice markets are developed, with sales of €159 billion and €652 billion in 2022,
respectively, which are projected to grow between 2022 and 2027 at compound annual growth rates of 3.3% and 5.0%,
respectively, according to Euromonitor International. In particular, there is a trend toward larger store concepts that can support
expanded product offerings and partnerships with branded quick service restaurants. These enhancements tend to appeal to
emerging consumer preferences and provide “one-stop” shopping solutions for “time-strapped” consumers.

**_Europe_**

_France_

After a period of consolidation, the number of forecourts in France has continued to decline, from approximately 11,000 in
2013 to approximately 10,500 in 2021. Retail sales through grocery & merchandise channels, helped by inflationary pressures,
increased by 6% in 2022 to €11.1 billion. A larger proportion of office workers returning to offices and continued in the postCOVID-19 pandemic normalization of tourism and transportation activity also contributed to the sector’s strong performance
last year. Recently, supermarket chains have announced they intend to sell fuel at lower prices to increase store traffic, which
is likely to affect margins across the French market in the near-term After a brief recovery from the decline of 2020, French
retail fuel volumes are expected to steadily decrease from 2023 due to anticipated vehicle efficiency improvements and a
decline in average vehicle travel distance, which we believe is due to changing consumer behavior after the COVID-19
pandemic. France also has plans to end the sale of fossil fuel burning cars by 2040.

Recovery was also seen by forecourt retailers in 2022, due to a rebound in traffic after two years of low traffic in tourist and
transportation locations. Forecourt retailers are also tending to trade up in France, with better foodservice options and a more
local offering (for example, increased food options from nearby farmers), which has helped to drive growth. Given this and
other factors, forecourt grocery & merchandise sales are expected to increase by 1.3% annually between 2022 and 2027,
although this growth rate would be lower than the expected growth rate for the broader grocery & merchandise sector. On the
foodservice side, while the total number of consumer foodservice outlets remained well below pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels,
there were signs of recovery in 2022, due to the strong performance of quick service restaurants, which continued to gain
market share at the expense of other types of outlets. Within the quick service space, delivery and to-go accounted for almost
two thirds of value sales, with this share being particularly high in the case of burger, pizza and Asian outlets. Takeaway
accounted for 23.3% of all foodservice sales in 2022, compared to 14.2% in 2017, with this proportion expected to expand
further over the forecast period, as consumers seek greater convenience.

_Belgium_

In Belgium, in 2022, the number of forecourts was approximately 3,100, though the proportion of unmanned PFS sites remains
high. The increasing number of unmanned stations and expansion of non-fuel retail offerings may lead to the differentiation of
service stations into two main groups. Those in busier locations will offer a wide variety of extra services, while low-volume
stations will ultimately convert to unmanned sites. Forecourts operate under a mix of major fuel brands, brands owned by major
fuel producers and/or refiners and hypermarket brands. Diesel is expected to remain the most-sold fuel at Belgium forecourts
underpinned by an increase in the large-scale uptake of commercial fuel cards. Major fuel companies have developed the use


-----

of fuel cards as a marketing tool for the commercial end of the market, each offering the user various value-add services as a
way to differentiate from the fierce competition. After the declines in 2020 and 2021, fuel retail volumes rebounded moderately
in 2022, but are expected to decrease from 2023 driven by the electrification of the car fleet and other incentives to decarbonize
the transport sector. Non-fuel retailing is especially crucial in Belgium, where the fuel price and, effectively, the profit from
the fuel, are limited by the government.

Forecourt retailing is a small part of the grocery & merchandise market in Belgium, accounting for 11.6% of sales in 2022
according to Euromonitor International, and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 1.9% between 2022 and
2027, whereas the overall grocery & merchandise sector is projected to experience a compound annual growth rate of 2.7%
over the same period, according to Euromonitor International. With respect to foodservice, consumer spending on takeaway
foodservice has decreased as a proportion of overall foodservice spending to 20.5%, down from a high of 29.4% during the
COVID-19 pandemic, but still above pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels of approximately 14%.

_The Netherlands_

The retail fuel market in the Netherlands is highly fragmented and comprises approximately 4,150 sites. Unmanned stations
are a significant feature of the Dutch market, accounting for more than half of retail sites and operating at a price discount
compared to manned stations, increasing competition across the industry. Retail fuel market volumes have declined by a 2.1%
compound annual growth rate between 2018 and 2022, a trend that is expected to continue given improvements in car fuel
efficiency and increased EV adoption. Fuel margins have been traditionally robust, with little or no hypermarket activity in
fuel retailing; however, declining long-term demand and the growing proportion of automated service stations will likely weigh
on future fuel margins.

The total grocery & merchandise market is expected to grow at a 3.4% compound annual growth rate between 2022 and 2027,
according to Euromonitor International. As convenience retailers tend to have higher average unit prices than other grocery
retailers, it is expected that convenience retailers will see a small decline in sales value in 2023, linked to rising inflation. As
such, consumers will look for ways to cut back their spending on groceries, having an impact on the growth of convenience
retailers. However, during the following years, the category is forecast to see modest growth as long terms trends, such as
consumer interest in convenience and on-the-go consumption, will remain relevant and drive sales.

_Italy_

In Italy, there are approximately 21,700 forecourts, resulting in relatively low average fuel volumes sold per site. This is in part
due to structural factors, such as the rugged topography of the country but primarily due to over-supply in the market compared
to other European countries. The number of forecourts in Italy is expected to decline due to rising regulatory requirements and
economic pressure on small, low-volume sites. The discount sector, which typically consists primarily of supermarkets and
hypermarkets, has yet to establish a significant presence in Italy, there has been limited downward pressure on prices than in
other European markets. As a result, automated sites, however, have increased their market penetration but not to such an extent
that might have a material impact on the overall market. If the discount segment becomes further established, it is likely that
we would see further pressures on retail margins and this would force network consolidation as well as the diversification of
non-fuel offerings.

The forecourt grocery & merchandise and foodservice markets in Italy are challenging, comprising only a small percentage of
overall convenience spending. Furthermore, Italian consumers generally prefer full-service dining to foodservice, limiting the
potential size of the market. To this end, takeaway spending represented only 23.6% of consumer foodservice spending in 2022,
as compared to 67.2% spent on eat-in foodservice.

_Germany_

The German retail fuel market consists of roughly 14,450 forecourts and, historically, integrated refiners, including BP and
Shell have had a market-leading position. Fuel retailers have expanded their alternative fuel offerings, supported by government
policy to decarbonize the transport sector. As a result, many players are partnering to operate EV charge points, and the country
has the largest network in Europe of hydrogen refueling stations.

Total oil demand is still recovering from the lows of 2020, and it is expected to reach its post-pandemic peak in 2024, and then
is expected to decline. A switch to alternatively powered vehicles, particularly electric vehicles in the passenger car market,
and increasing fuel efficiency have resulted in a decrease in road fuel demand. Retail fuel margins are expected to remain


-----

relatively low by European standards. As a result, fuel retailers are expected to continue developing non-fuel offerings to
maximize forecourt revenue as demand for liquid fuels declines.

Grocery & merchandise sales in Germany have grown after the COVID-19 pandemic, with growth expected to accelerate from
€12.8 billion in sales in 2022 to €15.2 billion in sales in 2027 (3.4% compound annual growth rate), according to Euromonitor
International, due to the development of more sophisticated convenience retail propositions. The German Foodservice industry
is also expected to deliver a strong compound annual growth rate of 7.3% between 2022 and 2027, with consumer spending on
takeaway offerings representing 22.9% of 2022 foodservice spending.

_The United Kingdom_

In the United Kingdom, there are approximately 8,350 forecourts owned by a combination of supermarkets, independent CStore companies and major fuel producers and/or refiners. Supermarkets such as Tesco, Morrisons, Sainsbury’s and Asda
operate approximately 1,500 sites, with major fuel producers and/or refiners also representing a large proportion of total sites.
The dominance of discounted hypermarket sites, and the emergence of the four large dealer groups, has meant that to remain
competitive, suppliers currently operate a high throughput, low margin just-in-time delivery model. As a result, UK retail fuel
prices remain some of the lowest pre-tax in Europe.

In 2022, forecourt retailers, often located at petrol stations, continued to grow and build upon momentum from increased local
shopping during the COVID-19 pandemic by expanding their offerings. Forecourt convenience sales in the United Kingdom
are forecast to grow at a 4.0% compound annual growth rate between 2022 and 2027, lagging behind the 4.5% expected annual
growth in the overall UK grocery & merchandise market. The grocery & merchandise and foodservice markets had sales of
€47 billion and €69 billion in 2022, respectively, and are projected to grow between 2022 and 2027 at compound annual growth
rates of 4.5% and 5.7%, respectively, according to Euromonitor International.

**_Australia_**

There are currently approximately 7,100 grocery & merchandise outlets in Australia. The number of fuel stations has decreased
dramatically since the 1970s as a result of rationalization. However, the number of sites has stabilized in recent years. The New
South Wales government is developing new mixed communities which need to have access to services, which may create
demand and opportunity for new fuel station site development across the region. Retail fuel volumes increased at a compound
annual growth rate of approximately 4.6% from 2014 to 2019, before decreasing due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Fuel volumes
in 2022 continue to lag behind highs from before the COVID-19 pandemic by approximately 25%, but have increased steadily
year-on-year, growing by 33% between 2021 and 2022.

The Australian grocery & merchandise and foodservice markets have witnessed meaningful growth, with total sales for these
industries in 2022 being €7.7 billion and €35.4 billion, respectively. Furthermore, grocery & merchandise sales are expected
to grow at a compound annual growth rate from 2022 to 2027 of 1.9%, largely expected to result from increasing urbanization,
with time-strapped consumers driving demand for convenience. Meanwhile foodservice sales are expected to grow at a CAGR
of 6.2% over the same timeframe, according to Euromonitor International.

**BUSINESS**

**Overview**

We are a leading independent global convenience retailer that served 1,143 million customers worldwide in the year ended
December 31, 2022. We have a diversified portfolio of 5,937 sites across three continents after giving effect to the Transactions.
Based on our site count, we are the third largest independent convenience retailer chain globally (after giving effect to the
Transactions), the fifth largest in the United States, the second largest in Continental Europe and the second largest in Australia.

Our total fuel volumes sold was 17.7 billion liters for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 (16.1 billion liters after giving
effect to the Transactions). Our global operations span six of the ten largest fuel markets in Europe by fuel volumes sold,
namely Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, all six states in Australia and 30 states
across the United States. Our Fuel operations are complemented by our Grocery & Merchandise and Foodservice operations,
under which we offer our proprietary brands as well as partner with attractive third-party brands. We seek to deliver a modern
and convenient customer retail experience by providing a “one-stop shop” retail destination that offers a broad range of products
and services to address evolving customer needs. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, we generated revenue of $26,203
million and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16 of $1,147 million, in each case after giving effect to the Pre-Offering
Transactions.

The following table sets forth in more detail the countries in which we operate and a more granular breakdown of our sites in
each of these countries (for these purposes, we have aggregated the sites we have in Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg)
as of June 30, 2023 after giving effect to the Transactions:

(1) The Group operates 58 company-owned franchisee-operated stores located in California and Nevada.

(2) The Disposed UK Business sold pursuant to the UK Disposal to Asda has not been included in the “Total” calculations.

(3) The UK&I total number includes 66 sites (54 Starbucks sites and 12 KFC sites ) that will form part of the Retained UK&I Business and are presented
separately from the 66 PFS sites on which such foodservice sites are located and which will be sold pursuant to the UK Disposal to Asda.

We are headquartered in Blackburn in the United Kingdom and were founded in 2001 by the Issa family – including brothers
Zuber and Mohsin, our current co-CEOs and major shareholders – with the acquisition of a single petrol filing station site in
Bury, Greater Manchester. Since then, we have expanded rapidly to 6,532 sites across three continents (before giving effect to
the Transactions) and over 55,380 employees worldwide as of June 30, 2023.

**The History and Evolution of Our Business**

The Issa family’s involvement in the petrol filing station and forecourt business began in 2001 when they founded Euro Garages
and subsequently rapidly expanded the business through organic growth and successful acquisitions of businesses and sites
from major fuel producers and/or refiners. Prior to its acquisition of EFR Midco B.V. (“EFR”) in 2016, Euro Garages operated
forecourt sites across the United Kingdom with petrol filling stations under the brand names of its fuel suppliers, Esso, Shell
and BP. In addition, Euro Garages operated Grocery & Merchandise and Foodservice concessions as part of its forecourts and
as standalone sites. EFR, established in 2007 as Delek Europe, was the European fuel retail and marketing assets arm of the
Delek Group. Its name was changed to EFR in February 2015 when it was acquired by TDR Capital. In 2016, Euro Garages
acquired EFR, which was by then a leading independent convenience retailer operator in Continental Europe with over 1,100
sites across Belgium, France, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. Together, Euro Garages and EFR became a pan-European
leader in the convenience retailer sector, initially under the trade name Intervias. In September 2017, the business was rebranded “EG Group.”

Since the acquisition of EFR, our business has evolved to become a global convenience retailer operator, entering new
geographies and consolidating existing markets to increase geographic reach and profitability. As part of our growth strategy,
we have completed a number of selective acquisitions of varying sizes, including multiple large-scale acquisitions, and also
added numerous individual sites to its portfolio through organic growth and NTI sites. More recently, we have also divested a
number of our assets where we found suitable market opportunities to exit on attractive valuations, and have used the proceeds
to pay down our debt and focus on growth and investment in our remaining business.

_United Kingdom & Ireland_

In the United Kingdom, we grew from our first site in Bury to a portfolio of 1,091 sites, including 387 PFS sites, 387 Grocery
& Merchandise outlets and 1,057 Foodservice outlets (with certain sites having multiple outlets), located throughout the United
Kingdom & Ireland as of June 30, 2023.

In March 2020, we acquired the United Kingdom and Ireland’s largest KFC franchise from the Herbert Group, which included
a network of 145 KFC restaurants and further expansion opportunities, for a total consideration of $160 million. Subsequently,
in May 2021, we completed the acquisition of LEON Restaurants for a total consideration of $139 million as a result of the

LEON Acquisition. This acquisition enabled us to further enhance our Foodservice portfolio. The LEON brand will be sold as
part of the UK Disposal to Asda. In September 2021, we acquired 52 KFC restaurants in the UK & Ireland from Amsric Group
as part of the Amsric Acquisition. The acquired network, across the south and south-west regions, comprised more than 1,600
team members and a mix of high-quality drive-thru and traditional restaurant formats. The acquisition strengthened our
customer proposition and is highly complementary to existing operations. In October 2021, we acquired Cooplands for a total
consideration of $93 million. Cooplands owns and operates bakery assets in the United Kingdom, including two bakeries that
process ingredients and manufacture fresh food distributed through its supply and logistics network to many stores and cafes,
predominantly across the north-east and Yorkshire regions. We will retain Cooplands following the UK Disposal to Asda.

On May 30, 2023, we announced our binding agreement to sell a substantial majority of our Fuel, Foodservice and Grocery
and Merchandise business in the United Kingdom to Asda, which was completed on Oct 31, 2023 for consideration of £2
billion. Our Retained UK&I Business (as defined herein) will consist of: (i) the electric vehicle charging business, ‘evpoint;
(ii) non-transferring head office staff; (iii) certain brands and intellectual property (including ‘EG’, ‘Euro Garages’,
‘Vapexchange’ and ‘Hyperform’); (iv) the Cooplands business; (v) the franchise businesses carried on under the Starbucks
brand and the KFC brand; (vi) the franchise businesses carried on under the Chaiiwala brand and the Cinnabon brand; (vii) the
Euro Grocer business; (viii) 31 operational petrol filling stations and a cluster of Foodservice outlets in the United Kingdom
that were not sold as part of the UK Disposal to Asda; (ix) two additional petrol filing stations in the United Kingdom that were
acquired subsequent to our agreement with Asda relating to the UK Disposal to Asda; and (x) undeveloped land bank assets.
For a description of the key terms of the UK Disposal to Asda, see “The Transactions—The UK Disposal to Asda—Sale and
_Purchase Agreement”._

The UK Disposal to Asda was a transformational step for us. The proceeds from the UK Disposal to Asda, along with the
proceeds from the U.S. Sale and Leaseback and Non-Core Minit Mart Disposal (Missouri and Kansas), will be used to repay
certain of our term loan facilities, as described in _“Summary—Recent Developments—Senior Credit Facilities Amend and_
_Extend”, and to redeem a portion of our Existing Notes. See “Capitalization”._

The UK Disposal to Asda is the cornerstone of our strategy to reduce total net leverage, extend our financing maturities and
reposition our capital structure for future business growth and financial resilience. Following the UK Disposal to Asda, we will
continue to operate and maximize long-term growth opportunities in the United States, Australia, Germany, France, Italy, the
Netherlands, Luxembourg and Belgium, and will continue to consider our strategic options in the Retained UK&I Business.

The perimeter and financial metrics of the Disposed UK Business are not identical to our business division in the United
Kingdom and Ireland. As presented in our historical financial accounts and in this Offering Memorandum, our United Kingdom
and Ireland business division’s results of operations and KPIs include the Retained UK&I Business and do not reflect any
deduction for shared service center costs attributable to such operations. However, when adjusting our consolidated financial
KPIs for the Pre-Offering Transactions or the Transactions in this Offering Memorandum, including for the purposes of
calculating Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, we have specifically removed amounts attributable to the Disposed UK Business,
as well as for the Non-Core Asset Disposals, and have given pro forma effect to the U.S. Sale and Leaseback.

_Continental Europe_

In 2018, we expanded our presence in Continental Europe through the acquisitions of Esso Italy, Esso Germany and NRG
convenience retailers in the Netherlands. This involved the acquisition of 1,173 Esso PFS sites in Italy in February 2018, 97
NRG convenience retailers in the Netherlands in April 2018 and 1,019 Esso PFS sites in Germany in October 2018.

In January 2021, as a result of the KMS Acquisition, we acquired ten petrol filling stations, six Burger King restaurants and
ten gaming halls in Germany. On June 30, 2021, we completed the acquisition of two existing KFC drive-thru restaurants in
south Germany from Klink Betriebe Gmbh & Co. In January 2022, we acquired M&L Gastronomiegesellschaft GmbH and
Geiger Fast Food GmbH in Germany for consideration of $33 million. The portfolio acquired was made up of seven KFC
stores. On May 1, 2022, we also acquired 285 OMV PFS sites in Germany for consideration of $541 million. These acquisitions
formed part of our growth strategy and enabled us to further expand into the European foodservice market. As per the German
Anti-Trust Authorities’ clearance decision, we agreed to divest 48 sites in order for the OMV Acquisition to proceed, 24 of
which were in our existing estate and 24 in the OMV estate. These divestments were completed in the third quarter of 2022.
As of June 30, 2023, our Continental European portfolio consisted of 3,271 sites, including 3,245 PFS sites, 696 Grocery &
Merchandise outlets and 277 Foodservice outlets.

_United States_

In 2018, we entered the United States, the world’s largest convenience retail market, with the acquisitions of the Kroger
convenience retail locations, which operated in 18 U.S. states, and Minit Mart, through which we expanded into five additional


-----

U.S. states. The Kroger acquisition, completed in April 2018, added 762 convenience retail locations to our portfolio, while
the Minit Mart acquisition, completed in December 2018, added an additional 235 convenience retail locations to our portfolio.

In addition, we further expanded our presence in the United States by completing the acquisitions of Fastrac in July 2019,
which added 54 sites to our portfolio, and Certified Oil in August 2019, which added an additional 70 sites to our portfolio.
Furthermore, in October 2019, we completed the acquisition of Cumberland Farms, which added 568 convenience retail
locations to our portfolio and was a significant leap forward in strengthening our presence in the United States.

Through our acquisition of Cumberland Farms, were able to build upon their successful model for their non-fuel offering,
through which they offer high-quality local and national brands as well as a broad range of higher margin private label and
fresh food products. Cumberland Farms’ stores measure approximately 3,500 square feet on average. This sizeable retail space
allows Cumberland Farms to offer a wider variety of private label and fresh food products alongside a comprehensive selection
of third-party branded products, increasing revenue and profit per site. The Cumberland Farms’ acquisition was also in line
with our strategic focus on Grocery & Merchandise and Foodservice, and the geographical proximity of its operations to our
other U.S. convenience retail locations in the northeastern United States and Florida created enhanced opportunities for
synergies, helping accelerate our efforts to roll-out of this model across our U.S. site network.

In December 2020, we completed the Schrader Oil acquisition through which we acquired assets from Schrader Oil at 18
company-operated fuel and convenience retail locations in Colorado and rolled them under the Loaf ‘N Jug banner. In June
2021, we completed the Mercury Acquisition through which we acquired assets from Mercury at eight leased locations in
Connecticut. In December 2021, we completed the Sprint Acquisition through which we acquired 34 company-operated fuel
and convenience retail locations in Georgia and South Carolina and the proprietary ‘Sprint Kitchen’ Foodservice brand.

More recently in May 2023, as part of our efforts to rationalize our portfolio and optimize our capital structure, we entered into
an agreement for the sale and leaseback of a portfolio of 414 sites across Cumberland Farms, Fastrac, Tom Thumb and Sprint
banners in the United States through our U.S. Sale and Leaseback, for which we received gross proceeds of $1.5 billion. See
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—The U.S. Sale and Leaseback Transaction.” In addition, in April 2023, we
completed the sale of 26 non-core company operated Minit Mart locations in Missouri and Kansas for net proceeds of $48
million. Furthermore, in August 2023, we announced our agreement to sell a further 63 convenience retail locations in Kentucky
and Tennessee to Casey’s General Stores, Inc., of which the sale of 55 sites was completed in November 2023 for net proceeds
of $84.4 million.

As of June 30, 2023, after giving effect to the Transactions, our portfolio in the United States consisted of 1,582 sites, including
1,508 PFS sites, 1,514 Grocery & Merchandise outlets and 311 Foodservice outlets.

_Australia_

In April 2019, we expanded our footprint to Australia through the completion of the FuelCo Acquisition, through which we
became one of Australia’s largest independent fuel retailer by fuel volume and are now the second largest by site count as a
result of acquiring Woolworths Group’s convenience retail locations. We continue to consolidate our presence in Australia and
over the last year have completed the rebranding of all our sites to EG from Woolworths, with respect to the banners above
stores, and to Ampol from Caltex, with respect to fuel-branding on all site canopy and site pylons.

As of June 30, 2023, our portfolio in Australia consisted of 525 sites, with each of our sites including a PFS site and a Grocery
& Merchandise store.

The following chart sets out the timeline of our most significant acquisitions since 2016:

**Our Strengths**

We believe the following strengths have contributed to our success.

**Leading independent global convenience retailer with diversification and scale across key geographies, products and**
**services**

We are a leading global independent convenience retailer with a diversified portfolio of sites across ten countries in three
continents, which consists of 5,937 sites after giving effect to the Transactions. We are the third largest independent
convenience retailer chain globally based on site count (after giving effect to the Transactions) and we sold approximately 17.7
billion liters of fuel for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 (approximately 16.1 billion liters after giving effect to the
Transactions). We believe that our scale and diversification across leading regions and markets improves our resilience and
allows us to maintain profitability through varying business cycles in different geographies.

In the United States, we have an established presence across 30 states and we are the fifth largest independent convenience
retailer operating based on site count. In Europe, we are the second largest independent convenience retailer based on site count
with operations in six of the ten largest national fuel markets by volume. In each of these markets, we are among the three
largest independent retailers by site count. We are also the second largest independent convenience retailer by site numbers in
Australia.

We believe that our diversified footprint reduces our exposure to the economic, political and weather-related risks of any single
country, providing us with balanced exposure to multiple national economies with different economic cycles and
macroeconomic fundamentals. Our geographic diversification is shown in the following chart, which sets forth our gross profit
by region for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 (after giving effect to the Pre-Offering Transactions):

**Gross Profit By Region**

##### Australia

(1) Europe includes Continental Europe and the United Kingdom and Ireland. Following the UK Disposal to Asda, we will report the Retained
UK&I Business operations as part of the Europe segment. If we enter into definitive contracts to sell the Retained UK&I Business (excluding
the ‘evpoint’ business, the Cooplands business, the Starbucks Business (as defined herein) and the KFC Business (as defined herein)) to Zuber
Issa and the KFC-Business to a third party, we would expect to report these businesses as assets held for sale on our balance sheet, pending
completion of the deals. See “Recent Developments.”

Our footprint in Europe is spread across eight countries, including the United Kingdom and Ireland and six countries in
Continental Europe, further mitigating our exposure to a particular geography. Furthermore, our earnings are well-diversified
across non-fuel and fuel operations. Our business streams, Grocery & Merchandise, Foodservice and Fuel, complement one
another and offer customers a one-stop solution at most of our sites. The revenue and gross profit from largely non-discretionary
fuel purchases provide us with a stable income stream from our fuel operations. This is complemented by the strong margin
contribution from our attractive Grocery & Merchandise and Foodservice operations, which also drive increased customer
traffic and sales volume at our sites. Overall, we have a well-diversified split of gross profit between non-fuel and fuel

(1) Our other operations include certain ancillary products, services and commissions, such as car washes, lottery ticket sales, ATMs, in-store and

outdoor click-and-collect lockers, hotels and gambling/slot machines.

We believe that a core advantage of our scale and diversification across geographies is that it allows us to apply our operating
model and processes across our global portfolio to drive individual site and corporate revenue and profitability. We benefit
from cost efficiencies and shared best practices resulting from our large global network, which allows us to realize significant
economies of scale, including favorable procurement terms, lower above-site costs as a percentage of sales and favorable
working capital levels. For example, we minimize our operating expenses and maximize our operations controls through lean
and efficient above-site management at our shared service center, which manages the procurement, finance, human resources,
fuel pricing, commercial, IT, legal and real estate functions across our entire European network. For instance, we use the
Fairbanks fuel management system to keep track of volume at our pumps across our network and have dedicated fuel pricing
teams to monitor data and set fuel prices across our network. In addition, our leading global and local market positions and our
flexible operating model position us as an attractive partner to popular Grocery & Merchandise and Foodservice brands, which
in turn tends to attract increasing customer traffic to our network.

**Resilient financial performance and robust profits from core business**

We believe we have achieved strong and resilient financial performance through a combination of organic growth, strategic
acquisitions and a focus on maximizing synergies from acquisitions through rapid integration of the acquired assets into our
platform. Our geographic spread and diversification by product has also increased our financial resilience and performance in
different market conditions.

After giving effect to the Pre-Offering Transactions, our gross profit and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16 for the
twelve months ended June 30, 2023 were $3.8 billion and $1,147 million, respectively. For the full year to December 31, 2022,
our historical gross profit rose by 6% year-on-year to $4.4 billion, supported by the performance of all our three business
streams – Grocery & Merchandise, Foodservice and Fuel – whereas Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16 decreased by 5% to
$1.4 billion. Below is a breakdown of our gross profit and Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16 by geographic region (in each
case, after giving effect to the Pre-Offering Transactions and deducting shared service costs):

  - In the United States, for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, our gross profit was $1,841 million and our Adjusted
EBITDA before IFRS 16 was $465 million. In comparison, our gross profit was $1,850 million and our Adjusted
EBITDA before IFRS 16 was $488 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.

  - In Europe, for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, our gross profit was $1,582 million and our Adjusted EBITDA
before IFRS 16 was $378 million. In comparison, our gross profit was $1,567 million and our Adjusted EBITDA
before IFRS 16 was $425 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.

  - In Australia, for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, our gross profit was $400 million and our Adjusted EBITDA
before IFRS 16 was $124 million. In comparison, our gross profit was $414 million and our Adjusted EBITDA before
IFRS 16 was $132 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.

Fuel prices at the pump can experience some volatility depending on macroeconomic factors, such as inflation and global oil
prices, and this occasionally causes short-term fluctuations in the gross margin we generate per liter of fuel volume sold. Our
long-term gross margin for fuel has been consistently increasing over time, offsetting the impact of decreasing fuel volumes,
the inflation-linked increases in site operating costs and the extreme oil volatility seen in 2022 driven by the Russian invasion
of Ukraine. High margin Grocery & Merchandise and Foodservice operations tend to contribute to increasing customer traffic
to our sites, supporting sales volume and margin expansion and diversifying our profits away from fuel operations.

Our business is highly cash generative and we benefit from limited working capital requirements, with a strong as pro forma
adjusted cash conversion ratio of 83% for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 after giving effect to the Pre-Offering
Transactions. Our typically well invested sites require only limited maintenance capital expenditure, which amounted to $127
million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023.

We believe that our resilience was demonstrated during the COVID-19 pandemic. As our operating countries experienced
lockdown restrictions at different times, we kept operations running in the remaining locations and applied what we had learned
at the affected sites across our network by sharing best practices. We believe this softened the aggregate financial impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic on the Group as a whole and strengthened our ability to adapt to the developing stages of the pandemic.

**Established business models with high percentage of stores owned and operated business by the Group**

Our operating business model has powered the growth of our site network from a single UK site in 2001 to 5,937 sites across
three continents and ten countries (after giving effect to the Transactions). Our growth journey has been facilitated by our
acquisitions and our new-to-industry (“NTI”) opening program. A significant proportion of our sites are company owned and
company operated (“COCO”), which is our preferred model in most countries, and our sites are typically larger than the average
site size in most of the markets in which we operate, allowing us to generate greater revenue per site. The table below shows
how the average annual volume of fuel sold at one of our sites compares to the average for the relevant region.

**Region** **United States** **Europe** **Australia**
Average annual volume of fuel sold per site (in million liters)[ (1)] .......... 3.4 1.7 3.3
Average annual volume of fuel sold at EG site (in million liters)[ (2)] ...... 3.9 2.0[(3)] 4.8

(1) Does not include the average volumes for Luxembourg. Based on fuel volume data from 2022.

(2)  Based on fuel volume data from 2022.

(3)  Includes the Retained UK&I Business.

We have a dynamic approach to managing our site estate, whereby we can achieve growth in the number of sites we operate
through acquisitions – although we anticipate being highly selective and strategic with respect to these in the near term – or the
development of NTI sites. In addition to growing our site numbers, we continuously look to upgrade the quality of our estate
through knock-down-rebuilds (“KDRs,” known as ‘raze-and-rebuilds’ in the United States) site conversions and refreshes, and
to dispose certain sites to align our network with our strategic priorities.

We have a mix of COCO, company-owned, not company-operated (“CONCO”), and third party owned and operated sites. Our
different models result in different levels of revenue generation and require different levels of capital expenditure.

Our operating models can be described in more detail as follows:

  - COCO operations are directly managed by us and for these we control all aspects of the performance and maintenance
of the site. The COCO model is our preferred operating model in most countries. Through this model, we have an
opportunity to control important factors that have a direct impact on the customer experience and profitability of each
site, such as site layout and quality, better customer service, product and service offering selection, fuel and non-fuel
pricing policies, staff scheduling and cost control. The COCO model is usually more profitable than our other
operating models, as it allows us to capture full profit margins at any given site.

  - At CONCO sites, the dealer, franchisee or third party retailer is responsible for all non-fuel operations, as well as the
operating costs associated with the management of the site, whereas we remain responsible for any capital and
maintenance costs associated with the fuel equipment, and in some instances we have a consignment arrangement for
fuel sales and inventory.


-----

  - Other sites are owned and operated by a third party who has full responsibility for the performance and maintenance
of the site. We either have a fuel supply arrangement in place with the third party, or, alternatively, the fuel supply is
on a consignment basis.

As of June 30, 2023, we had 4,314 COCO sites, accounting for 66.0% of our total sites. The chart below shows the percentage
of Group sites by operating model as of June 30, 2023.

**Group sites By Operating Model**

**(as of June 30, 2023)**

###### 11%

 23%

 66%

 COCO CONCO Other

After giving effect to the Transactions, we will continue to retain 3,719 COCO sites, accounting for 62.6% of our total sites.

We have a track record of performance improvement through the conversion of sites to COCO to benefit from greater control
of operations, with EG assuming responsibility for all employees on site. While this model means we incur the full cost base
of the site, with COCO we benefit from the site’s full margin potential with little to no conversion costs typically incurred. We
currently plan to focus on our sites in Germany and Italy for COCO conversions. At the same time, our ability to use different
operating models provides us with flexibility to tailor our approach to the requirements of each specific site, expand our nonfuel offerings, and to adjust our capital expenditure and other costs accordingly.

**Attractive fuel and non-fuel offerings underpinned by long term relationships with key brands**

A majority of our sites have branded retail “one-stop” backcourts that seek to satisfy the multiple needs of our customers. In
addition to fuel, these sites offer a wide range of food and non-food products specifically tailored to address the everyday
household needs and preferences of its local customers.

We continuously review our brand portfolio and evaluate opportunities to partner with additional leading Fuel, Grocery &
Merchandise and Foodservice brands. Our offering is further complemented by a portfolio of our own brands, including
Cooplands, the UK’s second largest bakery business, Go Fresh, which is present mainly in the Benelux region, and Cumberland
Farms, Fastrac, Certified Oil, Sprint, Kwik Shop, Loaf ‘N Jug, Quik Stop, Tom Thumb, Turkey Hill and Minit Mart, which are
present in the United States.

The Cumberland Farms brand in particular is central to our US strategy, since its brand value is underpinned by the sizable
retail space available at most Cumberland Farms sites. Also, its large warehouse and distribution facilities are in close proximity
to our other US sites providing opportunities to grow this brand. Following the Cumberland Farms Acquisition in October
2019, we have been able to leverage Cumberland Farms’ food production capability and private label brands, including its
Farmhouse Kitchen brand, to expand our capacity to offer our customers competitively priced alternatives to global and regional
brands, increasing the attractiveness and variety of our fresh food offerings and providing us with a greater number of products
that are exclusively available from our stores to further differentiate us from our competitors. As part of our efforts to leverage
this brand, we took the decision at the end of 2021 to commence a rebranding program of a number of sites in the United States
from our Tom Thumb brand to our Cumberland Farms brand, with 26 being completed during 2022 and an additional five in
the six months ended June 30, 2023.


-----

We proactively engage and work with well-known regional and global retail brand partners to deliver Fuel, Grocery &
Merchandise and Foodservice offerings that satisfy our customers’ evolving expectations. Brands are deployed on a site-bysite basis through a selection process driven, in part, by local and regional tastes and preferences. As a result of the scale and
quality of our network and our strong track record as convenience store operators, we are able to attract well-recognized global
and regional brands to partner with us. For instance, we partner with Fuel brands such as Esso, BP, Shell, Texaco and Ampol,
well-known Grocery & Merchandise brands such as SPAR, Carrefour and Louis Delhaize, and globally recognized Foodservice
brands such as Starbucks, KFC, Burger King and Subway, as well as strong local foodservice brands such as Greggs and
Pomme de Pain. We continue to strengthen our brand partnerships with our Foodservice brand partners with 102 new sites
opening in the year ended December 31, 2022, a demonstration of our commitment to expand the brand offerings.

As direct operators of the third-party branded stores, outlets and concessions located at our sites, we act as brand ambassadors
for our partners, which we believe reflects the trust our partners have in our operational capabilities. We believe these valuable
and well-known brands increase customer confidence in our products and services, leading to higher customer traffic and sales
volume, which in turn tends to strengthen our existing partnerships and increase our attractiveness to other leading brands. The
following tables provide an overview of our key Fuel, Grocery & Merchandise and Foodservice brand partnerships as well as
our proprietary brands (after giving effect to the Transactions):

**High quality real estate portfolio**

Our retail network consists of 5,937 sites after giving effect to the Transactions across the globe, many of which are strategically
located in high traffic areas. These include 3,719 company-owned sites after giving effect to the Transactions, comprising
freehold sites, leasehold sites, as well as sites that are partially freehold and partially leasehold and concession sites. Our


-----

concession sites give us the right to develop these sites according to the terms of the development proposal we provided to the
respective seller during the open bid process.

A large proportion of our real estate portfolio in the United States and Europe consists of freehold or long leasehold sites. As
of June 30, 2023, after giving effect to the Transactions, 30% of our property portfolio based on the number of sites was
freehold, comprising 1,795 sites, 56% of our property portfolio based on the number of sites was leasehold (including long
leasehold), comprising 3,342 sites, 1% of our portfolio based on the number of sites was a hybrid of freehold and leasehold,
comprising 68 sites, 9% of our portfolio consisted of third-party sites, comprising 545 sites, and 3% of our portfolio based on
the number of sites was concessions, comprising 187 sites. While the value of our real estate portfolio fluctuates depending on
market conditions and other factors (see “Risk Factors—Ownership and leasing of a broad portfolio of real estate exposes us
_to potential losses and, liabilities and fluctuations in market price”), we believe that our global real estate footprint including_
a large number of freehold and long leasehold sites provide us with long term stability. Despite current market conditions and
the interest rate environment leading to depressed valuations for commercial real estate across Europe and the United States,
we still have significant real estate value underpinning our business. According to the Real Estate Reports, based on current
interest rate levels and market conditions, the aggregated sales price of our properties (after giving effect to the Transactions)
is more than $4.0 billion (equivalent) on the basis that they are fully equipped operational entities and taking into account their
trading potential and EBITDA generation. See “Business—Property—Real Estate Reports.”

The quality of our estate is also complemented by our portfolio of 263 highway and highway-like sites in Europe (including
seven in the United Kingdom after giving effect to the Pre-Offering Transactions). Our highway sites tend to have higher fuel
margins and include Grocery & Merchandise and Foodservice offerings. Most of our highway sites operate under our COCO
model, allowing us to benefit from the full margin on Fuel, Grocery & Merchandise and Foodservice offerings.

Our valuable real estate portfolio also provides a potential source of liquidity. Over the last few months we have been able to,
and in the future may continue to, selectively monetize portions of our real estate portfolio to take advantage of favorable
trading conditions and pursue our strategic priorities, including deleveraging on attractive terms. See “—Our Strategies—
_Rationalization of portfolio and focus on robust capital structure.”_

**Strong management team led by our co-founders**

We have an experienced and dedicated management team focused on sustainable and profitable growth for our business, with
a number of team members having over 25 years of experience with the Group or in the industry. Our global managers include
our visionary founders and co-CEOs, Zuber Issa and Mohsin Issa, who both have extensive expertise in the convenience retail
sector. Following the Issa family’s acquisition of their first site in 2001, they have led the business to become one of the leading
global independent convenience store operators. We believe that the entrepreneurial spirit of our management team creates a
culture focused on long-term, profitable growth and cash generation.

As disclosed in “Recent Developments,” upon completion of the potential sale to Zuber Issa of the majority of the Retained
UK&I Business, he intends to step down as Co-CEO, remaining on our Board as non-executive director. Mohsin Issa would
then become our sole CEO and would continue leading our strategy going forward, supported by our strong senior management
team responsible for day-to-day operations, including John Carey, President and CEO of EG America, Imraan Patel, Chief
Strategy and Business Officer and Michael Bradley, Chief Financial Officer. John Carey was appointed President and CEO of
EG America with effect from October 1, 2023, with a mandate to drive forward our growth strategy in the United States, our
largest market by both revenue and sites.

Our decentralized management structure is composed of seven country or regional managers, each with extensive industry
experience. They are responsible for day-to-day operations in Australia, the Benelux region, France, Germany, Italy, the United
Kingdom and Ireland and the United States. The Nomination Committee of our Board ensures a robust leadership talent pipeline
and succession plans for the Board and senior management are in place, taking account of risk areas, gender and diversity.

**Our Strategies**

Our strategy is to continue our disciplined approach to growing our market share, enhancing our profitability, ensuring that our
business is run sustainably and generating robust cash flows to drive further deleveraging and investment.

**Focus on growing our market share and optimizing our existing operations and asset base**

We aim to continue to optimize our operations to ensure that we are deriving maximum value and market share from our
existing asset base. We aim to achieve this through organic growth, developing NTI sites in strategic locations and redeveloping
certain sites as part of our KDR program, as well as through continuing to extract synergies from past acquisitions and, where


-----

an attractive opportunity presents itself, undertaking strategic acquisitions or divestments and realizing value from our real
estate portfolio on a disciplined basis. The map below shows our current global footprint (after giving effect to the
Transactions).

United States

In the United States, we operate across 30 states and are the fifth largest independent convenience retailer in the country, with
a scaled coast-to-coast national footprint and various avenues for additional growth.

We believe the U.S. market provides a significant opportunity to focus on our operating initiatives, strengthen our core business
and drive sustainable growth. Going forward, we believe it could provide a blueprint for our global initiatives to improve
performance while minimizing capital spend to support our financial policy goals, focusing on the following value propositions:

  - Winning Offer: Expand offerings with a focus on dispensed beverage, food and margin enhancing private label while
maintaining a hyper-localized approach to enhance the customer experience.

  - Winning Fuel: Drive volume growth through investment in growing segments (diesel/ B2B) while maintaining the
Group’s focus on a premium offering to maximize margin.

  - Winning Customer: Engage with our active customer base through an enhanced omnichannel experience with a focus
on loyalty.

  - Winning Efficiency: Continue to focus on our expansive cost reduction measures to drive enhanced profitability.

A key aspect of our U.S. strategy is to capitalize on the brand equity of Cumberland Farms, which we plan to do through store
rebranding initiatives as well as expanding Cumberland Farms’ well-developed private label offerings and food production
capacities. As part of these efforts, we have already commenced rebranding a number of our sites in the United States from our
Tom Thumb brand to our Cumberland Farms brand, with 26 such rebrandings being completed during 2022 and an additional
five being completed in the six months ended June 30, 2023. In addition, we believe there are opportunities to increase the
Grocery & Merchandise and Foodservice contribution from our sites through actions such as price book optimization and
reduction of product waste.

We plan to increase our Foodservice offerings in the United States, which accounted for only 3% of our gross profit in the
region for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023. We aim do this both by expanding our proprietary brands as well as
leveraging our existing partnerships with established third-party brands. We also plan to expand our SmartPay mobile
application, as well as deploy our proprietary brands, throughout our non-Cumberland Farms estate. The SmartPay program is


-----

a mobile application which allows us to offer and promote lower retail prices to SmartPay users in a targeted manner through
payment programs and marketing and customer savings promotions. Launched in 2013, this program has already reached $6
billion in fuel sales and saved members more than $200 million, and we believe it has significant potential for further growth.
In addition, we opened 13 NTI sites in the United States during 2022, while a further two NTI sites opened this year.

Europe (Continental Europe and United Kingdom and Ireland)

We are the second largest independent fuel and convenience store business in Continental Europe, with a strong presence in
key markets and a significant opportunity for additional growth.

A key part of our European strategy is to invest in our Foodservice and non-fuel offerings in the region. Our efforts to achieve
this include a rollout of well recognized Foodservice brands and outlets across Continental Europe, with 277 such outlets open
as of June 30, 2023. Our growth strategy has historically also included pursuing inorganic growth when the appropriate
opportunity presents itself. For instance, we completed the acquisition of OMV’s German forecourt business, consisting of 285
sites in southern Germany on May 1, 2022, of which 24 were divested as part of obtaining regulatory approval for the
transaction (in addition to 24 of our existing German sites). While we intend to remain disciplined and focused on reducing net
leverage, we continue to follow a disciplined approach to acquisition opportunities both in existing markets as well as potential
new ones, with a focus on driving competency, capability, scale and balance sheet efficiencies. We also continued our
expansion in Europe through additional NTI sites, with three such sites opening in 2022 and a further four so far this year.

In addition, we recognize the accelerating shift towards alternatively fueled vehicles in Europe and the rest of the world and
plan to accelerate the roll-out of ‘evpoint,’ our proprietary electric vehicle charging proposition throughout Europe. We had
470 EV chargers across the United Kingdom and Continental Europe at the end of 2022 and have added a further 192 chargers
as of June 30, 2023.

Our European estate also represents the highest proportion of CONCO sites, with 2,202 dealer, franchisee or retailer operated
sites at the end of 2022, largely across Italy and Germany. A key part of our growth strategy for Continental Europe is to review
and identify dealer‑operated sites which we can convert to our preferred COCO model. During 2022, 52 conversions took place
and a further 20 took place in the six months ended June 30, 2023. We typically incur little to no costs in connection with
COCO conversions, unless we decide to convert CONCO sites to COCO sites before our contracts with the relevant dealers,
franchisees and retailers expire, in which case we may need to pay early termination fees.

Australia

We are the second largest independent convenience store retailer by site numbers in Australia and aim to further consolidate
our presence in the region.

Our 525 COCO sites in Australia already include Fuel and Grocery & Merchandise offerings, however, we have been
transforming the network through continued upgrades and rebranding. In 2022, we opened seven NTI stores and have eight
sites currently under construction. We also recently rebranded from Woolworths to EG in our Grocery & Merchandise stores
and from Caltex to Ampol for Fuel.

We are focused on expanding our offers to our customers in Australia and have launched a delivery service across our network
with our delivery partners such as UBER, Menulog and DoorDash. These partnerships have allowed us to expand our Grocery
& Merchandise online offers to include virtual stores under brands such as Eats2U, Olivers and Ben & Jerry’s. We have also
expanded our B2B partnerships and have entered into partnerships with motoring associations and large consumer
organizations such as electricity providers. Through these partnerships, we provide targeted online fuel offers to these
organizations.

**Enhance Foodservice offerings and continue to grow, invest in and realize identified synergies from proprietary**
**Foodservice brands**

An increasingly important part of our strategy is the development of our Foodservice business, especially in light of the secular
growth this sector is expected to experience over the next few years, driven by changing lifestyles and consumer preferences.
Our scaled, global footprint across the Foodservice market, driven by our strong international brand partnerships and strategic
acquisitions, provides us with a strong platform from which to capitalize on this growth trend.

We have been successfully operating Foodservice outlets for over a decade and we are a partner of choice for many leading
third‑party brands. Across the Group, we will continue to operate 1,201 Foodservice outlets after giving effect to the
Transactions. We believe that there is significant scope to further expand our Foodservice business, especially since


-----

Foodservice offerings on a backcourt platform remain underdeveloped across most countries in which we operate in terms of
the quality and choice provided at most outlets. We are strongly positioned to fill this gap since we are already a significant
operator of scale of Foodservice sites and have established a position as a leading franchisee for our brand partners. In recent
years, our expanded Foodservice operations have transformed our sites into destinations serving multiple customer needs,
which supports an increase in customer traffic and sales volumes, and we intend to replicate this across selected sites across
the Group. This is reflected in the recent growth of our Foodservice gross profit, which for 2022 was $705 million compared
to $614 million in 2021, a year-on-year increase of 15%, and for the six months ended June 30, 2023 was $389 million, an
increase of 10% from the six months ended June 30, 2022.

We have made continued investment in Foodservice outlets globally with a total of 102 new outlets opening in the year ended
December 31, 2022. At the same time, we have continued to invest in and grow our proprietary Foodservice brand network.

**Pursue a multi-pronged strategy for energy transition**

As the world transitions to a lower carbon future, and the demand for electric vehicles is expected to increase, we believe the
long-term trend towards electrification of vehicles presents a significant opportunity for us, and one which we are wellpositioned to capitalize on given the site network we already own. We have a multi-pronged strategy to provide EV charging
stations (also referred to herein as charge points, charging points or chargers) and alternative fuels across our platform and a
key aspect of this plan is our electric vehicle charging point strategy, in particular ‘evpoint’ – our proprietary branded, ultrafast electric vehicle charging proposition.

We believe ‘evpoint’ has the potential to become one of Europe’s leading charge point operators. Our flagship location at
Frontier Park in Blackburn, United Kingdom, the home of six ultra-fast chargers, opened in August 2022. We already installed
‘evpoint’ ultra-fast chargers at over 20 trial sites across the United Kingdom and Continental Europe in 2022 and a further 33
sites in the first half of 2023. We have also earmarked a broader rollout across hundreds of our sites through to 2026. The
Retained UK&I Business will include all of our EV chargers in the United Kingdom following the UK Disposal to Asda. With
between two and six charging points per site, and innovations in charging hardware, including load-balancing technology means
several customers can use a single location simultaneously.

In the United States, our strategy has been to partner with leading third-party charge point operators on EV charge points. These
partnerships allow us to leverage our network and reach but minimize the need for deploying our own capital. As such, our EV
charge points in the United States will have third party branding, compared to our EV charge points in Europe that will primarily
have our own branding. We currently do not have any near-term plans for an EV charger roll-out in Australia, but continue to
review our strategy in this area.

We have continued our rollout of EV chargers across the United Kingdom and some sites in Continental Europe. While we
will divest most of our roadside locations in the United Kingdom when we complete the UK Disposal to Asda, we have
deliberately retained 31 well-developed sites in the UK to maintain our presence in this mature, attractive and innovative market
and to use our residual footprint there as a platform to test, adapt and fine-tune our European EV charger offering as well as
the introduction of other developing applications.

As of June 30, 2023, we operate 635 electric charging points (compared to just 250 in 2021 and 470 as of December 31, 2022)
across 189 sites in the United Kingdom and Continental Europe and have identified hundreds of additional sites that, due to
their locations and nature, are suitable for additional electric charging points as part of the next wave of site developments
through to 2026. We plan to continue our rollout of EV chargers during the remainder of 2023, with a further 60 electric
charging points operating by the end of the year, a majority of which will be ultra-fast chargers. We believe one of our key
strengths in the EV charging point market lies in our expansive forecourt footprint. For many of our competitors, their key
challenges and costs include finding suitable and cost-efficient locations on which to install EV chargers. However, our
forecourts provide us access to locations, and we plan to make continued, efficient investments in this space in order to roll out
further electric charging points. The performance of our trial EV chargers has provided us comfort that the profit margins
achievable on the sale of energy through EV chargers provide a strong business case for a broader roll out. To support this
vision, we are working with other market participants for the deployment of infrastructure and services to support energy
transition demand across our network. See “Business—Our Additional Operations—Electric Vehicle Charging Stations and
_Alternative Fuels.”_

We believe our EV charging stations create a ‘halo effect’ by driving increased customer footfall to their locations. Our chargers
are concentrated at locations that have fulsome Grocery & Merchandise and Foodservice offerings, and we have found that the
presence of electric charging stations helps drive increased customer footfall for such other offerings as well, since customers
will typically spend time at the forecourt while their vehicle is being charged. This increases the implied profit margin of our
electric charging stations, and we believe this provides us with an advantage over standalone electric charge point providers


-----

that do not have the advantage of our large and well-developed forecourt network. Similarly, we also find that our EV chargers
that are on well-developed forecourts benefit from higher utilization, since customers who visit the forecourt using electric
vehicles will often use that time to top-up their charge. We expect to continue to benefit from this virtuous cycle following the
UK Disposal to Asda as we have agreed to enter into a right to occupation arrangement with Asda that would allow us to
continue to use the forecourts being sold for our existing EV chargers and to have the right to deploy additional EV chargers
on any Asda sites (including standalone forecourt sites and Asda supermarkets) in the future, including but not limited to CStore sites sold pursuant to the UK Disposal to Asda. In addition to providing this ‘halo effect’ and higher profit margins than
traditional fuel products, EV chargers also assist with our working capital management by reducing our need for liquid fuel
inventory.

We are conscious that alternative forms of power, other than electric, are being explored as a means to fuel cars, light vehicles
and trucks. Beyond EV chargers, we are also actively considering how compressed natural gas (“CNG”), liquefied petroleum
gas (“LPG”) and hydrogen may form part of a broader strategic program of retail fuels at our sites to sit alongside traditional
transport fuels, with a particular focus on the potential for hydrogen to power light and heavy-duty vehicles. See “Business—
_Our Additional Operations—Electric Vehicle Charging Stations and Alternative Fuels— Alternative Fuels.”_ In addition, we
are also exploring ways to reduce our carbon footprint through our energy usage. We have already switched to renewable
electricity at a number of sites across the UK and Continental Europe, including all our sites in Luxembourg. Additionally, all
of our ‘evpoint’ branded chargers sell electricity only generated from renewable energy sources. We install solar panels
wherever feasible at NTI and KDR sites, including petrol filling stations and all suitable Foodservice sites, as well as our UK
head office. Thus far in 2023, we have generated more than 1,808,992 kWhs of electricity using solar panels. We also continue
to explore battery storage with the aim of securing self-generated electricity, and in early 2023 we installed our first battery
storage unit at our head office in the United Kingdom. Our EV chargers also generate carbon credits for us which we are
currently in the process of obtaining certification for, following which we may be able to monetize our carbon credits as we
grow our EV charging station network.

**Rationalization of portfolio and focus on strong capital structure**

During 2023, we have undertaken a number of major steps towards deleveraging and addressing our debt maturities. In May
2023, we completed the sale and leaseback of a portfolio of our US assets, comprising 414 sites across our Cumberland Farms,
Fastrac, Tom Thumb and Sprint brands, with gross proceeds of $1.5 billion (the “U.S. Sale and Leaseback”) and we announced
the UK Disposal to Asda for consideration of £2 billion, which was completed on October 31, 2023. In addition, we also
completed or announced a number of smaller transactions, comprising (i) the disposal of 26 company operated Minit Mart
locations in the Missouri and Kansas resulting in net proceeds of $43 million in April 2023 and (ii) the sale of 55 company
operated Minit Mart locations in Kentucky and Northern Tennessee with net proceeds of $84.4 million. The net proceeds from
the UK Disposal to Asda, the Amend and Extend, the U.S. Sale and Leaseback and the Non-Core Minit Mart Disposal (Missouri
and Kansas) are being used to repay our existing senior secured debt, contributing to a total gross debt reduction of $3,816
million since June 30, 2023.

In June 2023, we successfully undertook an amendment and extension process to extend the maturities of $3,169 million of
euro, dollar and sterling denominated term loan facilities to 2028 under our Senior Credit Facilities Agreement (the “Amend
and Extend”), which will take effect on the Conditions Satisfaction Date (as defined herein). See “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—Senior Credit Facilities Agreement.” As a result of this activity and our other efforts, we expect to_
reduce total net leverage from 6.3x for the year ended December 31, 2022 to 5.1x after the completion of this Offering and
giving effect to the use of proceeds contemplated herein. See “Capitalization” and “Summary Consolidated Historical and As
_Adjusted Financial Information and Other Data—Other Financial and Operating Data.” We remain committed to achieving_
and maintaining a net leverage multiple in the mid 4x range in the near- to medium-term, which we aim to achieve through
organic growth in earnings and free cash flow generation and through working capital initiatives and reduced discretionary
growth capital expenditures.

After giving effect to the Transactions, we will have third party debt of $229 million maturing in February 2025, $71 million
maturing in March 2026, $671 million maturing in April 2027, $3,662 million maturing in February 2028 and a further $1,589
million maturing in November 2028.

We believe that our diversified business and robust asset base put us in a strong position to access multiple pools of liquidity
to help reduce the overall quantum of our debt. For example, in order to manage our debt quantum and capital structure we
may consider releasing value from our owned real estate, potential asset sales, and/or third-party minority equity funding for
emerging businesses or concepts such as ‘evpoint’, in addition to relying on a disciplined approach to capital expenditure,
organic growth and free cashflow generation. We believe that we continue to have multiple potential levers to support our


-----

deleveraging objective and we will continue to consider these on a selective basis where we believe they make financial sense
and align with our strategic vision.

**Continued investment in, and review of, our site network**

As an entrepreneurial business, we are always looking to drive growth by investing in our site network and developing our
retail offerings. We aim to continue to capitalize on opportunities to grow, although, especially in the current environment, we
plan to do so through a disciplined approach that is in line with our financial policy.

A key pillar of our organic growth plans is growing our footprint through the building and operation of NTI sites, which provide
us with greater ability to apply our preferred multi-format operating platform offering Grocery & Merchandise, Foodservice
and Fuel (including lower-carbon fuels) products. These NTI sites are typically larger than our existing sites and often quickly
develop into some of our best-performing sites. In line with this strategy, we opened 31 NTI sites in 2022 (compared to 30 in
2021), out of which 13 were opened in the United States, eight in the United Kingdom and Ireland (of which seven will be sold
pursuant to the UK Disposal to Asda), seven in Australia and three in continental Europe. In the six months ended June 30,
2023, we have completed the opening of another seven NTI sites, out of which two opened in the US, one in the Disposed UK
Business and four in Continental Europe. Since June 30, 2023, we have opened another six NTI sites and are currently working
on bringing another forty-two to market. We have continued to grow our land bank to support future new site openings, which
we expect will support our roll-out of additional NTI sites across all of our regions.

In addition, we aim to continue to examine our site network, looking for opportunities to re-invigorate sites through KDRs and
through expansion of our offerings through either extension to existing buildings or through the purchase of adjacent land and
construction of new facilities. Our decision to undertake a KDR depends upon a variety of factors, including potential traffic
flow and customer footfall, the ability to set up or increase our Grocery & Merchandise and Foodservice offerings, the existence
of local competitors and local amenities and the site’s potential profitability. Although our plan is to focus more on organic
growth and become increasingly selective when we consider inorganic growth opportunities, we aim to continue assessing
strategic acquisition opportunities when the appropriate business proposition presents itself. When we review acquisition
targets, we look for a strategically well-located portfolio of sites and real estate of good quality, generally underpinned by
freehold value irrespective of geography.

During 2022, we completed the acquisition of OMV’s high‑quality German forecourt business, consisting of 285 sites in
Southern Germany, for a consideration of €495 million ($541 million). On a smaller scale, we also completed a KFC acquisition
in Germany, which enhanced our growing Foodservice business by providing seven additional sites, for €27 million ($33
million). For a full list of our acquisitions since 2021, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
_Results of Operations—Factors Affecting Comparability of Our Financial Statements—Acquisitions and Disposals.” We_
believe we can add additional value to such sites by leveraging our supply chain network and expertise, expanding brand
partnerships in both fuel and non-fuel operations and introducing our proprietary brands where appropriate, and generating
economies by leveraging EG Group’s advantageous commercial arrangements and negotiating strength.

**Our Operations**

We have developed our market positions in these regions by, among other things, relying on our extensive site network, diverse
offering portfolio, partnerships, flexible operating models, experienced management team and multinational regulatory
expertise and operational capabilities.

**_Our Products and Services_**

We provide three primary categories of products and services: Fuel, Grocery & Merchandise and Foodservice. We operate
primarily through partnerships with well-known brands across our product and service offerings. We also offer our own-brand
Fuel, Grocery & Merchandise and Foodservice products and services at several of our sites, and plan to explore ways to further
expand our offerings.

In addition, we provide certain ancillary products and services, which we believe represent attractive cross-selling
opportunities, complement our main business activities and allow us to further diversify our sources of revenue. These products
and services include car washes, lottery ticket sales, ATMs, hotels, restaurants, in-store and outdoor click-and-collect lockers
and video games.

**_Our Management Structure_**

Our management structure combines the expertise of our senior management team, comprising our global and country
managers, with the day-to-day support of our local management team.

Our senior management team includes our co-founders and co-CEOs, Zuber Vali Issa and Mohsin Issa, and it oversees the
overall operations, business model and strategies of the Group. In addition, our senior managers benefit from support by TDR
Capital, one of our principal shareholders and management consultants. Our country managers lead our operations in Australia,
the Benelux region, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States. We believe that our management
structure incorporates appropriate flexibility for our country managers to take the actions they need to implement our global
strategies and initiatives in light of national market considerations. As disclosed in “Recent Developments,” upon completion
of the potential sale to Zuber Issa of the majority of the Retained UK&I Business, he intends to step down as Co-CEO,
remaining on our Board as non-executive director. Mohsin Issa would then become our sole CEO and would continue leading
our strategy going forward, supported by our strong senior management team responsible for day-to-day operations, including
John Carey, President and CEO of EG America, Imraan Patel, Chief Strategy and Business Officer and Michael Bradley, Chief
Financial Officer. John Carey was appointed President and CEO of EG America with effect from October 1, 2023, with a
mandate to drive forward our growth strategy in the United States, our largest market by both revenue and sites.

Our local management teams oversee the day-to-day operations at our sites and manage our compliance with local regulations.
For example, our local management teams monitor key performance indicators at a local level and determine staff scheduling
and product placement at our sites in line with localized market trends. For more information on our employees, see “—
_Employees.”_

Our management teams also work together to operate a Group-wide shared service center that manages our accounting,
reporting, information technology, human resources functions and other central corporate functions from our headquarters in
Blackburn, United Kingdom. Our shared service center provides back-office functions for our European operations and allows
us to manage the Group on a cost-efficient basis.

**_Our Operating Models_**

We have a mix of COCO, CONCO, and other retailer or dealer owned and operated sites. Our operating models can be described
in more detail as follows:

(1) COCO operations are directly managed by us and for these we control all aspects of the performance and
maintenance of the site. The COCO model is our preferred operating model. Through this model, we have
an opportunity to control important factors which have a direct impact on the customer experience and
profitability of each site, such as site layout and quality, customer service, product and service offering
selection, fuel and non-fuel pricing policies, staff scheduling and cost control. The COCO model is usually
more profitable than our other operating models as it allows us to capture profit that would otherwise be
payable to the site operator.

(2) At CONCO sites, the dealer, franchisee or retailer is responsible for all non-fuel operations, as well as the
operating costs associated with the management of the site, whereas we remain responsible for any capital
and maintenance costs associated with the fuel equipment, and in some instances we have a consignment
arrangement for fuel sales and inventory.

(3) Other sites are owned and operated by a third party who has full responsibility for the performance and
maintenance of the site. We either have a fuel supply arrangement in place with the third party, or,
alternatively, the fuel supply is on a consignment basis.

The table below sets out the number of our sites split by operating model within each region in which we operated as of June 30,
2023 (after giving effect to the Transactions).

Notes:

(1) Other sites include retailer-owner, retailer-operated sites and dealer-owned dealer-operated sites as well as sites which are operated by an authorized

distributor, a joint venture or an agent.

We continue to work towards extending the COCO model, where suitable, to additional sites in Continental Europe and
converting certain CONCO sites, particularly in Germany and Italy, into more profitable COCO sites, as described in detail in
“—Our Strategies—Focus on growing our market share and optimizing our existing operations and asset base.”

**_Descriptions of Our Operations by Region_**

The regions in which we operate, which correspond to our reporting segments, consist of the following (after giving effect to
the Transactions):

(1) Europe, comprised of our Retained UK&I Business as well as operating entities in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy,

Luxembourg and the Netherlands which are combined into a single reporting segment because they show similar longterm economic performance, have comparable products, customers and distribution channels and are steered and
monitored together.

to Asda, we will report the Retained UK&I Business operations as part of the Europe segment and have included it below.

In addition, we also have six fuel depots (three of which are joint ventures) and one lubricant warehouse in Europe. These are
mainly used to store fuel to be transferred to our petrol filing stations across Europe. In the case of the joint venture facilities,
our partners also store their own fuel at those sites. We also operate two hotels in Belgium – one in Heverlee Noord and one in
Groot-Bijgaarden Noord. The following map shows our network of sites across Europe as of June 30, 2023 (after giving effect

_Fuel Operations in Europe_

After giving effect to the Transactions, we operated 3,276 petrol filing stations in Europe as of June 30, 2023. After giving
effect to the Transactions, we sold 7.5 billion liters of fuel in Europe for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 under the BP,
Esso, Shell and Texaco brands, our proprietary Firezone brand and certain minor oil brands.

Fuel price is a significant driver of competition in the forecourt industry and is driven by a variety of factors, including
maximum price limits set by governments, such as those in Belgium and Luxembourg. In addition, lower margins per liter in
Italy and Germany, due to local market conditions and fewer COCO locations, tend to have a dilutive effect on the overall
Group fuel margin. Within these parameters, historically we have had more freedom to set prices at our COCO sites, as opposed
to our other operating models where a third-party dealer, franchise or retailer makes the pricing decisions, and particularly at
our manned PFS locations with Grocery & Merchandise and Foodservice offerings. At our unmanned stations that offer a nofrills service, we typically sell fuel at a discount to attract customers and increase sales volumes. Our experience has
demonstrated that at manned PFS sites that we own and operate, the lower, more competitive pricing that we offer does not
generally increase sales volumes sufficiently to compensate for lost profit margins. We believe that, alternatively, an attractive
Grocery & Merchandise and/or Foodservice offering at manned PFS sites tends to increase customer footfall and sales volumes
because of the ‘halo effect’ provided by well-known Grocery & Merchandise and Foodservice brands at PFS sites. This allows
us to increase our prices and thus our fuel margins at such sites. In addition, we seek to realize cost savings through the
negotiation of more favorable terms for our fuel supply contracts.

We have dedicated fuel pricing teams that monitor fuel prices in real time in Europe. Our fuel pricing teams receive daily
updates from each site on local competitor prices, cost targets, historical records per site and the impact of cost movements on
volume in order to set daily prices. The daily prices are then communicated to the site managers. Real-time monitoring of fuel
prices allows us to react to market movements and adjust cost margins while live volume data helps us optimize our fuel
inventory management and control working capital.

In the regular course of our business, we enter into relationships with fuel suppliers whereby we commit to purchase certain
minimum quantities of fuel in order to benefit from better pricing conditions. We purchase fuel for each brand directly from
the relevant major fuel producer and/or refiner. Typically, at the end of each fuel supply contract period, we are also able to
change fuel suppliers and negotiate key terms such as price, payment and delivery terms and minimum volumes. We believe
that our long term relationships with our fuel suppliers reduce our exposure to re-contracting or termination risks. The average
length of our fuel supply contracts is five years. Since fuel products are commodities, we have no control over the changing
market value of our inventories. As our inventory is valued at the lower of weighted average cost and net realizable value
(which is based on market price), under our inventory valuation methodology, price fluctuations impact both cost of sales and
the value of the inventory reported in our financial statements. See “Summary Consolidated Historical and As Adjusted
_Financial Information and Other Data–Other Financial and Operating Data.” In addition, if the book value of our inventory_
is above its net realizable value on a certain balance sheet date, we are required to write down the inventory to net realizable
value. Due to the pricing arrangements under our fuel supply agreements and the high turnover levels of inventory held, the
measurement of the value of our inventory is based on the cost price of the inventory at our PFS sites.


-----

In Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, in order to increase customer footfall and sales volumes,
we also accept fuel cards issued by third-party card issuers (such as DKV and UTA) and by major fuel brands (such as Shell
in France), including through cross-acceptance agreements. Based on our agreements with these third parties, some fuel cards
are accepted across our various regions, while others are only accepted in specific countries. We also operate a loyalty program
in the Netherlands and France, under which customers accumulate points for all purchases made, which entitles them to
discounts on their future purchases. In the United Kingdom, we also have agreements to sell certain volumes to 3[rd] party fuel
card providers as well as oil majors, Esso, Shell, BP and Texaco.

_Ancillary Products and Services in Europe_

In Europe, we also generate a portion of our gross profit (6% of our total gross profit for the twelve months ended June 30,
2023 after giving effect to the Pre-Offering Transactions) from ancillary products and services, including rental income from
dealers operating at our sites, car wash income and hotel and restaurant income.

United States

We had 1,582 convenience retail locations in the United States as of June 30, 2023 (after giving effect to the Transactions).
The following map shows our network of sites across the United States, in 30 states including Alabama, California, Colorado,

Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana,
Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota,
Tennessee, Vermont, West Virginia and Wyoming.

1,523 of our convenience retail locations in the United States as of June 30, 2023 (after giving effect to the Transactions) are
COCO. At these COCO sites, we are therefore free to set prices and select stock and promotional offers, resulting in an increased
level of control over the revenue and margin generated by these sites. After giving effect to the Transactions, in the twelve
months ended June 30, 2023 in the United States, 48% of our gross profit was generated from Fuel sales, 44% of our gross
profit was generated from Grocery & Merchandise sales, 3% of our gross profit was generated from Foodservice sales and 5%
of our gross profit was generated from ancillary products and services.

_Grocery & Merchandise Operations in the United States_

We had 1,514 convenience retail stores offering Grocery & Merchandise products across 30 states in the United States as of
June 30, 2023 (after giving effect to the Transactions).

In the United States, our convenience retail stores are primarily branded Cumberland Farms, Turkey Hill, Loaf ‘N Jug, Kwik
Shop, Tom Thumb, Quik Stop, Minit Mart, Sprint, Fastrac and Certified Oil. A key aspect of our US strategy is to capitalize
on the brand equity of Cumberland Farms, which we plan to do through store rebranding initiatives as well as expanding
Cumberland Farms’ well-developed private label offerings and food production capacities. As part of our efforts to further
develop this brand, we decided at the end of 2021 to commence a rebranding program of a number of sites in the United States
from our Tom Thumb brand to our Cumberland Farms brand, with 31 being completed in the twelve months ended June 30,
2023.

The table below presents the key details of our main convenience retail proprietary brand in the United States as of June 30,
2023, unless otherwise indicated.

_Foodservice Operations in the United States_

We had 311 Foodservice outlets and concessions in the United States as of June 30, 2023 (after giving effect to the

_Fuel Operations in the United States_

We had 1,508 PFS sites in the United States as of June 30, 2023 (after giving effect to the Transactions). After giving effect to
the Transactions, we sold 6.1 billion liters of fuel in the United States for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023. The average
length of our fuel supply contracts is one year. In the United States, when we enter into unbranded contracts, we typically
negotiate a twelve-month contract.

Fuel price is a significant driver of competition in the forecourt industry and is driven by a variety of factors. Within these
parameters, historically we have had more freedom to set prices at our COCO sites, which account for 96% of our sites in the
United States.

We have dedicated fuel pricing teams that monitor fuel prices in real time in the United States. Our fuel pricing teams receive
daily updates from each site on local competitor prices, cost targets, historical records per site and the impact of cost movements
on volume in order to set daily prices. The daily prices are then communicated to the site managers or implemented on our
integrated price signs without involvement from the site managers. Real-time monitoring of fuel prices allows us to react to
market movements and adjust cost margins while live volume data helps us optimize our fuel inventory management and
control working capital.

The table below presents the key details of our partnerships with our main fuel brands in the United States as of June 30, 2023,
after giving effect to the Transactions.

ATMs and video games. For instance, our brands offer car wash services at 152 of our convenience retail locations in the
United States. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, such ancillary products and services accounted for 5% of our total
gross profit in the United States.

Australia

We have been operating in Australia since the FuelCo Acquisition in April 2019. We are the second largest independent
convenience retailer by site numbers in Australia, and aim to further consolidate our presence in the region. The following map
shows our national network of sites across Australia:

Our Australian business consists of 525 COCO sites, all of which have Fuel and Grocery & Merchandise offerings. The
Australian network has full independence to set prices and select stock and promotional offers in the market resulting in an
increased level of control over our revenue and margin generated by those sites.

In the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, in Australia, 77% of our gross profit was generated from Fuel sales and 22% of our
gross profit was generated from Grocery & Merchandise sales. We do not currently have any Foodservice operations in
Australia, but generated a small amount of revenue from our legacy Foodservice operations in the twelve months ended June
30, 2023.

The following chart shows our gross profit by business stream for Australia:


-----

Grocery & Merchandise Operations in Australia

In Australia, we have a strong Grocery & Merchandise offering. We had 525 convenience retail stores offering Grocery &
Merchandise products in Australia as of June 30, 2023.

As part of the FuelCo Acquisition, we entered into a transitional commercial alliance with the Woolworths Group, under which
we operated our Australian Grocery & Merchandise operations under the Woolworths brand until March 31, 2023. We have
since rebranded our Woolworths branded sites in Australia to EG.

Since the FuelCo Acquisition, we have expanded our Grocery & Merchandise offering in Australia. We have introduced a new
coffee and bakery offer in over 240 of our stores. We have also launched a delivery services offer across our network, with our
delivery partners such as UBER, Menulog and Door Dash. These partnerships also have allowed us to expand our online offers
that now include virtual stores under brands such as Eats2U, Olivers and Ben & Jerry’s. We believe these actions have improved
our offering mix within our stores and our in-store gross profit and gross profit margins.

Fuel Operations in Australia

We had 525 PFS sites in Australia as of June 30, 2023 and sold 2,471 million liters of fuel through these sites in the twelve
months ended June 30, 2023. Our fuel supplier in Australia is Ampol.

Our sites are typically in close proximity to Woolworths supermarkets in residential urban and rural areas or on main roads for
consumers in transit. We have a national presence in Australia, with 83% of our sites on the east coast where the majority of
Australia’s population resides. As part of our relationship with Woolworths, we have an agreement until 2033 pursuant to
which we are the only network that allows consumers to redeem Woolworth Group Supermarket fuel discounts at all locations
nationally coupled with other offers such as loyalty benefits under Woolworth Loyalty programs. We have also expanded into
new B2B partnerships with businesses that have large consumer bases, such as energy providers and motoring associations to
complement our fuel offers and to attract customers to our network.

Petrol prices tend to move up and down in cyclical patterns in Australia’s largest capital cities. The market is categorized by
petrol prices steadily decreasing for a period followed by a sharper increase. This pattern is also known as a petrol price cycle.
It is a movement in the retail price from a low point (or trough) to a high point (or peak) to the following low point. These
cycles can take between one to five weeks depending on the location. These gasoline retail price cycles do not typically occur
in each capital city at the same time, as prices are set competitively in each market and vary because of differences in the fuel
supply chains and lead times across Australia. The stage of the price restoration cycle we are in affects our Fuel margin, which
can vary on a daily, weekly and monthly basis and can cause some variation in our gross earnings. Over a larger time horizon,
our retail gross profit is more consistent, especially as prices in our other rural and regional markets are more stable. Large
spikes in oil prices or long, gradual increases or decreases in oil prices may from time to time impact our fuel gross profit and
stock valuations.

As part of the FuelCo Acquisition, EG Group agreed to continue FuelCo’s strategic partnership with Ampol (formerly operating
under the Caltex brand) involving a 15-year wholesale supply agreement entered into in July 2018 with the aim of providing a
competitive price for national volumes. In addition, as part of the FuelCo Acquisition, EG Group and the Woolworths Group
entered into a 15-year commercial alliance covering loyalty, fuel discount redemption, and wholesale supply across the FuelCo
network to incentivize customer footfall and sales volumes at the FuelCo PFS sites we acquired. The table below presents the
key details of our partnerships with main fuel brands in Australia as of June 30, 2023.

**Brands** **Number of PFS sites** **Key features**
Ampol ...................... 525 PFS sites - We (and before the FuelCo Acquisition, FuelCo) have partnered with
Ampol for 15 years in Australia.

                      - Earliest expiration date for the partnership is July 2033.

**_Our Additional Operations_**

_Electric Vehicle Charging Stations and Alternative Fuels_

To meet evolving consumer demands, we have a multi-pronged strategy to provide electric charging stations and alternative
fuels. See “—Our Strategies—Pursue a multi-pronged strategy for energy transition.”


-----

_Electric Vehicle Charging Stations_

Key to our EV charging point strategy is ‘evpoint’ – our proprietary branded, ultra-fast electric vehicle charging proposition
that we believe has the potential to become one of Europe’s leading charge point operators. Our flagship location at Frontier
Park in Blackburn, United Kingdom the home of six ultra-fast chargers, opened in August 2022. We already installed ‘evpoint’
ultra-fast chargers at over 20 trial sites across the United Kingdom and Europe in 2022 and a further 33 sites in the first half of
2023. We have also earmarked a broader rollout across many hundreds of our sites through to 2026. With between two and six
charging points per site, and innovations in charging hardware, the latest load-balancing technology means several customers
can use a single point simultaneously. Our Retained UK&I Business will include all of our EV chargers in the United Kingdom
& Ireland following the UK Disposal to Asda.

Our focus is to use our existing forecourt space to create a network of ultra-fast enroute charge points for our highway and
roadside locations, as well as creating ‘destination’ charge points that provide fast charging at locations where customers are
likely to spend an extended period of time, such as malls and large supermarkets. For our roadside C-Store sites, we believe
the ultra-fast chargers provide convenience and rapid charging to time-constrained customers, as well as an attractive
destination to wait and explore our Foodservice and Grocery & Merchandise offerings.

The performance of our trial EV chargers has provided us comfort that the profit margins achievable on the sale of energy
through EV chargers provide a strong business case for a broader roll out. In addition, our EV chargers also create a ‘halo
effect’ by driving increased customer footfall to their locations. These chargers are also concentrated at locations that have
well-developed Grocery & Merchandise and Foodservice offerings, and we have found that the presence of EV chargers helps
drive increased customer footfall for such other offerings as well, since customers will typically spend time at the forecourt
while their vehicle is being charged. This increases the implied profit margin of our electric charging stations, and we believe
this provides us with an advantage over standalone electric charge point providers that do not have the advantage of our large
and well developed forecourt network. Similarly, we also find that our EV chargers that are on well-developed forecourts
benefit from higher utilization, since customers who visit the forecourt using electric vehicles will often use that time to topup their charge. We will continue to benefit from this virtuous cycle following the UK Disposal to Asda, since we have agreed
to enter into a right to occupation arrangement with Asda that will allow us to continue to use the forecourts being sold for our
existing EV chargers and we have entered into the EVPoint Side Letter with Project America Bidco Limited and Asda Stores
Limited, under which the intention to appoint EV Point Services Limited (a member of the Group) or an affiliate as sole
provider, operator and installer of EV chargers at Asda sites (including standalone petrol forecourt sites and Asda supermarkets)
was documented, including but not limited to C-Store sites sold pursuant to the UK Disposal to Asda.

We have been rolling out EV chargers across the United Kingdom and some sites in continental Europe. As of June 30, 2023,
we operated 662 electric charging points (compared to just 250 in 2021) across 169 sites in the United Kingdom & Ireland and
Continental Europe and have identified hundreds of additional sites that, due to their locations and nature, are suitable for
additional electric charge points as part of the next wave of site developments. We plan to continue our rollout of EV chargers
during the remainder of 2023, with a further 60 electric charging points operating by the end of the year, a majority of which
will be ultra-fast chargers. Based on our current capital allocation plans, we plan to undertake around $20 million to $50 million
of capital expenditure per year for the next five years to build out our EV charging network, which would allow us to include
around 100-200 additional locations to our network per year, each equipped with between two to four EV chargers. However,
our key strength in this area is our ability to use our extensive site network to quickly ramp up this roll-out if demand and
market conditions are suitable. To this end, we have already identified sites across our network that would be capable of hosting
EV chargers, and we could seek external investment to support a roll-out to these sites if market opportunity presents itself. In
particular, there is potential access to public funding to build out EV charging networks in a number of regions in which we
operated, in particular the United States and Europe, and we continue to explore the possibility of accessing such funding. In
the United States, our strategy has been to partner with leading third party charge point operators on EV charge points. Such
public-private partnerships, or partnerships with private sources of capital, would allow us to use our network and reach but
minimize the need for deploying our own capital. The availability of such third party or public capital is particularly prevalent
in the United States, and as such we expect that our EV charge points in the United States will have third party branding,
compared to our EV charge points in Europe that will primarily have our own branding. We currently do not have any near
term plans for an EV charger roll-out in Australia, but intend to revisit our Australian strategy in 2024.

To grow our EV charging network while remaining disciplined with respect to our capital expenditure, we are working with
leading market participants for the deployment of infrastructure and services to support energy transition demand across our
network at a competitive cost. Our EV chargers also generate carbon credits for us, which we may monetize as we grow our
EV charging station network. In addition, we intend to make our EV chargers compliant with the open-source Open Charge
Point Protocol (“OCPP”), which will make us less vulnerable to any individual system supplier. We also intend to develop and
use our own software at our charging stations, which will provide us with valuable data relating to EV usage and charging


-----

pattens which we may be able to monetize in the future. We may also explore additional opportunities in this space, including
relating to proprietary software and technology.

Alternative Fuels

We are also actively considering how compressed natural gas, LPG and hydrogen may form part of a broader strategic program
of retail fuels at our sites to sit alongside traditional transport fuels, with a particular focus on the potential for hydrogen to
power light and heavy-duty vehicles. As part of the hydrogen strategy, we made a strategic investment in Hydrogen Vehicle
Systems Limited (“HVS”). Our investment in HVS, which will form a part of the Retained UK&I Business following the UK
Disposal to Asda, allows us insight into the development of the market for hydrogen commercial vehicles. By working with
the HVS team, we are expanding our thought leadership as well as starting to explore infrastructure planning to support
hydrogen refueling at key sites across our portfolio in the United Kingdom. Following our acquisition of OMV, we inherited a
minor stake (1.2%) in H2 Mobility in Germany. That venture has allowed fuel-cell vehicle drivers to refuel at hydrogen filling
stations throughout Germany and we believe that our involvement will allow us to gain an accelerated insight into the market
for hydrogen filling and position us to introduce hydrogen refueling at key sites in the future.

EG Fuel, our wholesale supply business, manages the entire supply chain of Neste MY Renewable Diesel, which is a diesel
replacement made from vegetable oils (such as used cooking oil) and fats, in-house. EG Fuel distributes this fuel directly from
the depot to business customers, such as transport, postal and construction companies. Neste MY Renewable Diesel claims to
reduce carbon emissions by around 75–95% compared to fossil fuel diesel. EG Fuel also supports customers with
documentation on carbon savings for their carbon reporting.

More than 120 of our 465 PFS sites in the Netherlands now offer customers Neste MY Renewable Diesel. In January 2023,
EG Fuel partnered with KLM Equipment Services (“KES”) to supply Neste MY Renewable Diesel for its vehicle fleet at
Amsterdam’s Schiphol airport, to be used across the airport fleet of around 1,900 vehicles.

_EG Fuel_

EG Fuel, our wholesale supply business, is responsible for managing our strategic and operational fuel supply chain activities.
EG Fuel currently manages the purchase, storage and distribution of ground fuels sold across our PFS sites as well as sales to
third-party wholesale and business-to-business customers and fuel suppliers. As discussed above under “—Alternative Fuels”,
EG Fuel also currently works on our alternative fuels strategy.

In addition, EG Fuel sells lubricants to different customers such as car dealerships and small and medium-sized businesses in
the Netherlands and Belgium.

EG Fuel handles fuel purchases in Europe, including through our own fuel terminal network across Belgium, France,
Luxembourg and the Netherlands. EG Fuel typically manages all fuel replenishment planning in-house with a mandate to
optimize distribution costs, working capital and business continuity while taking into account seasonality and local demands.
Our planning tools read stock levels in a fuel tank electronically, which allows us to “push” products, balance inventory and
manage working capital. We are able to track in real time where trucks are on the road in order to advise sites of estimated
arrival times as well as make any last-minute changes if required. Our on-board truck computers have the ability to e-mail or
print proof of delivery documents as soon as the delivery is complete.

EG Fuel partners with third-party haulers under typically three-to-five year contracts. We typically outsource our fleet, other
than in the Netherlands, where we have a hybrid model comprising of a third-party fleet and our own fleet. Our own fleet of
trucks mainly serves our business-to-business fuel customers, but also serves our own PFS sites. We have actively sought to
strategically reduce our fleet size to optimal levels in recent years, through improved planning and optimization, by renewing
fleet age and capacity and by adapting the above-described model based on optimal cost.

**ESG & Sustainability**

As a retailer with global operations and supply chains, our impacts are extensive and varied. We focus on the ESG issues that
are most relevant to our business and our stakeholders, and on the issues where we have the greatest ability to effect change.

In early 2022, we conducted a comprehensive ESG materiality assessment to identify and define our priorities. Based on this
materiality assessment, we set out our ESG strategy which covers three focus areas: Planet, Colleagues and Communities. We
have set certain specific performance improvement targets in each of these areas. In addition, we are committed to taking a
responsible approach to our ESG ‘fundamentals’ – these are issues that form part of our business as usual activity (such as


-----

health and safety and data protection). In 2023, we are focusing on embedding our new ESG strategy into the business, and
continue to work on delivering against our set targets.

_Planet_

We recognize that the world needs to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 at the latest. We aim to play our part in tackling
climate change by reducing emissions, scaling up products and services that foster lower-carbon mobility, and reducing our
waste. Our targets include:

(1) Own operations (Scope 1 and 2): Reduce our carbon footprint by at least 50% by 2030 (compared to 2021)
and reach net zero by 2050.

(2) Products and supply chain (Scope 3): Explore a carbon reduction target in 2023 / 2024; and

(3) Expand our lower-carbon mobility offerings, including electric vehicle charging.

_Colleagues_

We believe everyone should have the opportunity to create a better future. Therefore, on top of creating job opportunities, we
also aim to provide an inclusive culture where all our colleagues can develop, progress and share our success.

In 2021, we carried out our inaugural ‘Better Together’ Group-wide colleague survey, to measure colleague engagement and
experience. Following on from this, in 2022, our teams worked to create action plans, conduct listening sessions with
colleagues, and implement improvements to workplace policies and processes. We are also committed to work on increasing
the number of women in senior leadership positions in our group. Women currently account for 30% of our senior leadership
group (compared to 23% in 2021). In addition, HR leads conduct quarterly colleague engagement reviews and report this into
the Remuneration Committee. Out target is to improve our engagement score year-on-year, from 62% in 2021, and based on
the results of our 2023 survey, we are on track to meet that target.

_Communities_

We believe that where a person starts in life should not determine where they end up, and aim to create a better future for our
wider communities. Our targets:

(1) Extend our community programs across all our operating markets;

(2) Start to roll out our volunteering policy.

**Property**

We have a geographically diversified footprint across Europe, the United States and Australia, with 5,309 PFS sites, 2,766
Grocery & Merchandise stores and 1,201 Foodservice outlets and concessions as of June 30, 2023 (after giving effect to the
Transactions).

**_Sale and Leaseback Transactions_**

In May 2023, we completed the sale and leaseback of a portfolio of our U.S. assets, comprising 414 sites across our Cumberland
Farms, Fastrac, Tom Thumb and Sprint brands, for a gross consideration of $1.5 billion, the net proceeds from which have
been or will be used to pay down our existing debt. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—The U.S. Sale and
_Leaseback Transaction” and “The Transactions—Sale and Leaseback Transaction.” In addition, we also completed a smaller_
transaction involving the sale and leaseback of three sites in New South Wales, Australia for a gross consideration of $11
million in May 2023. These transactions were part of our broader strategy to deleverage and maintain a robust capital structure
in the medium term. See “—Our Strategies—Rationalization of portfolio and focus on robust capital structure.”

**_Ownership of Properties_**

As of June 30, 2023, after giving effect to the Transactions but excluding any retailer-owned, dealer-owned or authorized
distributor sites, land banks or closed sites, approximately 30% of our property portfolio was freehold, comprising 1,795 sites,
approximately 56% of our property portfolio was leasehold, including long leasehold comprising 3,342 sites, approximately
1% of our portfolio was a hybrid of freehold and leasehold, comprising 68 sites, and approximately 3% of our portfolio was
concessions, comprising 187 sites. For concession sites, we are required to bid for our rights to the site, and if we win the
respective bid, we have the right to operate the site according to the terms of our bid.

We continue to monitor our lease agreements in order to take advantage of our ability to renegotiate rental payments across our
portfolio when possible. For example, in the Benelux region, we have designated coordinators that review, on a quarterly basis,
all leases set to expire in the coming two years and negotiate renewals. We do not have a fixed process for lease contract
renewals, although typically we approach landlords several months before lease expiry to negotiate renewals. Certain of our
leases, including most of our leases in France, have automatic renewal clauses.

**_Highway Concessions_**

As of June 30, 2023 (after giving effect to the Transactions), our property portfolio included 263 highway and high-way like
sites in Europe, which are among our most profitable operations. Highway concession operations depend on authorizations
from governmental regulatory agencies in the countries in which we operate, which are subject to bids, expiration and
limitations on renewal. For example, some of our highway concessions are granted under the European sealed-bid process. As
part of the strategic review of our business operations, we regularly review opportunities to renew suitable highway concessions
and obtain new highway concessions in desirable locations and a have a positive track record of renewing concessions and
winning tenders.

**Real Estate Valuation and Real Estate Reports**

The value of our freehold and leasehold properties is subject to fluctuation and depends upon a number of factors including
market conditions and interest rates. From time to time, we undertake internal valuations or engage third parties to undertake a
valuation of our real estate portfolio. Prior to the reports described in this section, the last time we had a third party real estate
report issued was in 2019, when we commission CBRE to prepare a valuations of our real estate portfolio (the “CBRE Report”).
The value ascribed to our real estate portfolio in the CBRE report was approximately $6.9 billion, although we note that our
property portfolio has undergone a number of changes since that time. We subsequently prepared an updated management
estimate of our real estate portfolio in July 2022, pursuant to which we estimated the value of our real estate portfolio to be $10
billion ($3.5 billion of which relates to properties which were subsequently sold pursuant to the UK Disposal to Asda and the
U.S. Sale and Leaseback). Both the CBRE Report and our internal management estimates of real estate value were based a
number of assumptions, projections and estimates and we cannot assure you that the assumptions or projections used, estimates
made or procedures followed in the CBRE Report or in preparing our internal management estimates were correct, accurate or
complete.

In recent months, the value of commercial real estate in the markets in which we operate has been significantly depressed. A
key reason behind this is that the commercial real estate market is highly correlated with the level of interest rates and the yields
on government debt, which in certain markets may be used as a benchmark to price commercial mortgages. As a result, the
valuations given to our real estate portfolio may be lower than what we believe to be the underlying value of our real estate
portfolio and lower than its historical value or what would otherwise be given in better economic conditions. For example,
using the average base interest rates, spreads and overall investor cost of capital for the last 10 years and Rent Coverage of


-----

2.00x – 2.50x, Eastdil Secured arrived at a valuation of $2,949 million for our real estate portfolio in the United States versus
$2,489 million based upon current rates. See “—Real Estate Reports – Key findings.”

Interest rates in each of the regions in which we operate have significantly increased since mid-2022 and may remain at these
higher levels for longer than initially anticipated. This increase in interest rates has also increased the cost of commercial
mortgages in each of the markets in which we operate. The yields on corporate bonds issued by REITs and other large
institutional property investors have also increased significantly in this period. Such increase in yields, along with declining
share prices of a number of such large property investors, has increased the relative cost of capital for real estate acquisitions,
which in turn has depressed commercial real estate prices. Based on our internal assessment, this depression in commercial real
estate prices has also negatively impacted the value of our real estate portfolio. While we believe this depression in the value
of our commercial real estate is temporary and that the value will revert to closer to its historical value once market conditions
improve and interest rates stabilize, there can be no assurance regarding whether, or over what time fame, this will happen.
See, “Risk Factors—Disruptions in the financial markets, uncertain economic conditions, changes in interest rates and yields
_on government bonds and recent inflationary pressure could adversely affect the value of our real estate, which is subject_
_to fluctuation.”_

In light of the abovementioned changes in commercial real estate values, and in order to understand the value of our real estate
portfolio in current market conditions, in September 2023, we retained Cushman & Wakefield Netherlands B.V. (“Cushman
& Wakefield”) to perform a review of our portfolio of freehold and certain mixed interest properties in Europe and Eastdil
Secured, L.L.C. (“Eastdil Secured”, and together with Cushman & Wakefield, the “Report Providers”) to perform a review of
our portfolio of freehold and leasehold (having ground lease term of 30 years on average) properties in the United States. The
Cushman & Wakefield report (the “C&W Report”) was issued on October 31, 2023 and provides us with a broker’s opinion
on the market price of our real estate portfolio in Europe based on existing use (trading). The Eastdil report (the “Eastdil
Report”, and together with the C&W Report, the “Real Estate Reports”) was issued on October 27, 2023 and provides us with
a broker’s opinion on the market price of our real estate portfolio in the United States based on existing use (trading). The
review and valuations set forth in the Real Estate Reports do not cover the properties we have disposed of pursuant to the U.S.
Sale and Leaseback, the UK Disposal to Asda and the Non-Core Asset Disposals.

The Real Estate Reports are intended to be an estimate of the market price of the underlying properties based on current market
conditions and various assumptions, and are not a recommendation of the price to be offered or paid for a property. The Real
Estate Reports do not constitute a formal valuation compiled in accordance with RICS Valuation Global Standards or Uniform
Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice. As such, there is a risk that property values indicated below diverge materially
from the market price of the underlying property or the indicative value that would be obtained if more comprehensive due
diligence was undertaken on the status and condition of each property. See “Risk Factors—Ownership and leasing of a broad
_portfolio of real estate exposes us to potential losses and, liabilities and fluctuations in market price.” The financial information_
relating to each property that was used to prepare the Real Estate Reports was provided to the Report Providers by us, and the
Report Providers have not independently verified, and do not assume responsibility for, the accuracy or completeness of any
such information. See “—Methodology, Assumptions and Basis of Broker’s Opinion of Pricing.”

**_Real Estate Reports – Key findings_**

According to the Real Estate Reports, the aggregate value of our 1,109 freehold (or fee-simple, as applicable) properties in
Europe and our 953 freehold and leasehold (including long leasehold) properties in the United States on the basis of their
existing use (trading) as of October 1, 2023 is in the order $4.0 billion (equivalent). This value was calculated on the basis that
these properties are fully operational entities and having regard to their trading potential and EBITDA generation. The
following table sets forth the opinion of pricing attributed to our properties by country of operations.

____________

(1) A capitalization rate (“Cap Rate”) indicates the rate of return on investment in real estate property, and is calculated by dividing the Year 1 net
operating income attributable to the asset with its market value. The Real Estate Reports used Cap Rates attributed to each property (and, in the case
of the C&W Report, an ‘effort rate’ which is a rental amount derived from EBITDA) and the related EBITDAR (as defined below) for such property
to calculate market value. The Cap Rate for Europe relates to the average Cap Rate relating to our portfolio in Europe.
(2) Based on a EUR/USD exchange rate of $1.05580 per €1.
(3) The United Kingdom comprises of 31 operational sites and 14 development sites, which will be retained by the Group after giving effect to the UK
Disposal, but excludes the sites from the KFC Business, which will also be retained by the Group after giving effect to the UK Disposal. We believe
the sites from the KFC Business have a value of approximately $20 million.
(4) Based on a GBP/USD exchange rate of $1.15 per £1.
(5) Includes 744 freehold properties, 197 long leasehold properties, 11 mixed interest properties and 1 store support center. Includes sites retained by the
Group after giving effect to the Non-Core Asset Disposals.
(6) Represents an assumed Rent Coverage (as defined below) of approximately 2.00x – 2.50x and provides a valuation $2,489 million. This valuation
reflects 49% of enterprise value of the sites, which according to the Eastdil Report still presents a valuation on more conservative enterprise value
metrics than recent large-scale sale-leasebacks in operating assets. The Eastdil Report also presented an alternative ‘scenario 2’ based on an assumed
Rent Coverage of approximately 2.50x – 3.00x, which provided a valuation $2,039 million. These coverage ranges reflect general guidance, but certain
assets do not fall within these ranges due to other pricing considerations.

Eastdil Secured also prepared a valuation of our US real estate portfolio using the average base interest rates, spreads and
overall investor cost of capital for the last 10 years and Rent Coverage of approximately 2.00x – 2.50x. Based on these
assumptions, Eastdil Secured arrived at a valuation of $2,949 million.

In addition, Eastdil Secured also developed a view on the enterprise value of our 952 sites in the United States (excluding the
store support campus) based on recent transaction comparables involving market-leading convenience and fuel companies or
portfolios. Eastdil Secured considered an enterprise value multiple of 11.5x to 12.5x to be appropriate for our 952-asset
portfolio, resulting in a gross enterprise value of approximately $4.9 billion in an outright sale of the real estate and operations
as a going concern, based on a year-1 asset level Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16 of $410,994,904 relating to the
sites that are the subject of the Eastdil Report. Eastdil Secured believe this multiple range is appropriate given the attractiveness
of our portfolio, which includes numerous desirable attributes such as scale, geographic diversity, demonstrated asset-level
profitability, desirable sub-markets, institutional-quality real estate and well-known brands in their respective trade areas.

**_Overview of Market_**

Both Real Estate Reports contain an overview of the relevant market prepared by the Report Providers. Some of the factors
that have led to the depression of market price of commercial property in the current macro-economic environment are
highlighted in these market overviews, which we have summarized below. Each market overview is based on the relevant
Report Provider’s assessment of the market and, while it is based on information we believe to be accurate, neither the Report
Providers nor we take any responsibility for the accuracy of this information.

_C&W Report_

The C&W Report provides a summary of certain negative trends in the European real estate market. For the first six months in
2023, the average sale volumes are 50% below their average level from the relative periods in 2017-2019 (which the C&W
Report considers a more appropriate baseline for comparison in light of heightened investment activity in real estate during the
COVID-19 pandemic). The decline is attributed primarily to rising interest rates, economic uncertainty and unavailability of
credit. Using the decline in the market value of REITs as a real-time guide, the report provides that Continental European retail
real estate values have fallen 21.8% peak-to-trough, while retail real estate values in the United Kingdom have fallen by 52.1%.
Longer term valuations are expected to be contingent on the yields of 10-year government bonds, which according to the report
are expected to settle in 2.5% to 3.5% range for both the United Kingdom and Continental Europe. Real estate valuations have


-----

an inverse relationship with Cap Rates, and Cap Rates have risen across Europe as real estate values have fallen in recent
months. According to the C&W Report, Cap Rates are forecasted to steadily decline from 2024 till 2027.

_Eastdil Report_

According to the Eastdil Report, the convenience store and fuel station industry has proven to be relatively recession resilient
in response to the current macroeconomic volatility. There are over 150,000 convenience stores operating in the United States.
About 80% of these stores sell fuel, and the industry continues to be dominated by single-store operators, which account for
approximately 60% of all stores. In 2022, U.S. convenience stores served approximately 165 million customers daily,
accounting for over 10% of total retail and food service sales.

According to the Eastdil Report, the broader commercial real estate market outlook in the United States remains dependent on
the future of interest rates and the yields on U.S. treasuries, with the market current expecting the rates to be “higher for longer,”
which has led to a depression in real estate prices. Since June 2022, each major U.S. treasury has sustained significant increases
in rates, with 1-year treasury bills increasing from 2.06% to 5.47%, 2-year treasury notes increasing from 2.58% to 5.14%, 5year treasury notes increasing from 2.85% to 4.83%, 7-year treasury notes increasing from 2.89% to 4.86%, 10-year treasury
notes increasing from 2.87% to 4.82%, and 30-year treasury bonds increasing from 3.06% to 4.94% as of October 4, 2023. On
average, this reflects an increase of 229 basis points. This increase in risk-free rates has been reflected in the bond market,
where yields on corporate bonds issued by REITs have increased significantly. Along with declining share prices, this has
increased the relative cost of capital for real estate acquisitions, which in turn has depressed commercial real estate prices.

**_Methodology, Assumptions and Basis of Broker’s Opinion of Pricing_**

_C&W Report_

The C&W Report determines the broker’s opinion of pricing of each property on the basis of existing use (trading) of such
property as an operational C-Store. The broker’s opinion of pricing included in the C&W Report was provided using the local
currency for each country and has been converted into U.S. dollars at the closing rate as at October 1, 2023.

The opinion of pricing contained in the C&W Report of all properties was based on their existing use and based on financial
information we provided to Cushman & Wakefield. These included trading figures for 2022 and 2023 (year-to-date) for each
relevant property, which included retail and bunkering fuel volumes, fuel margins, shop turnover excluding VAT/IVA taxes,
shop margins, Foodservice turnover excluding VAT/IVA taxes, Foodservice margins, other income and site-by-site EBITDA
values.

The C&W Report was produced without any detailed physical inspection of any property, environmental audit, tests of services
and amenities or investigations as to the condition of the properties. The valuation analysis also did not take into account any
specific, current physical conditions of a property. In addition, the C&W Report was based on a number of assumptions relating
to the property portfolio, including:

  - that the value of properties subject to the C&W Report was linked to their trading potential. This was based on their
assumption that properties sold on the basis of their trading or underlying trading potential are designed or adapted
for a specific use, and the resulting lack of flexibility typically means that the pricing a particular property is
intrinsically linked to the trading potential of such property;

  - that we have the ability to obtain/renew existing licenses, consents, certificates and permits;

  - that each property is operated in accordance with its authorized use under planning legislation and in accordance
with the use registered with the relevant regulatory agency;

  - that the properties are not adversely affected by any existed or proposed environmental law;

  - that there are no abnormalities as to the repair and condition of the properties;

  - that the properties possess a good and marketable title free from any onerous restrictions or conditions;

  - that all title, legal, tenure, lettings, planning, taxation, statutory and local authority requirements are complied with;
and


-----

  - various other assumptions regarding tenure, letting, taxation, town planning, and the condition and repair of
buildings and sites—including ground and groundwater contamination.

To arrive at a broker’s opinion of pricing Cushman & Wakefield also took into account: a) the legal interest in the land and
buildings; b) the trade inventory, usually comprising all trade fixtures, fittings, furnishing and equipment; and c) the market’s
perception of the trading potential of each property, together with an assumed ability to obtain or review existing licenses,
consents, certificates and permits. The broker’s opinion of pricing presented in the C&W Report was arrived at using
comparable transactional evidence. Various initial yields were applied to petrol filling stations, depending upon their country,
specific geographic location, trading history and profitability. The presence or absence of local competition and the alternative
use potential of the site were also considered, in addition to evidence of rent for comparable sites. Furthermore, the C&W
Report also took account of the condition and size of the properties being assessed and the current petroleum and economic
market conditions. The site information used to perform the brokers’ opinion of pricing was solely provided by EG Group and
consisted of:

   - information about tenure, plot area and other land registry details per site;

   - an overview of site area, shop area and sale area per location;

   - historic trading figures (2022 and 2023 YTD) for each property to include a profit and loss account;

   - revenue broken down by income stream, margin for each, operating expenditure and EBITDA. By way of
example this included:

`o` retail and bunkering fuel volumes;

`o` fuel margins;

`o` shop turnover excluding VAT/IVA taxes;

`o` shop margins;

`o` Foodservice turnover excluding VAT/IVA taxes;

`o` Foodservice margins, other income; and

`o` site-by-site EBITDA values.

_Eastdil Report_

The Eastdil Report determines the broker’s opinion of pricing of each property on the basis of existing use (trading) of such
property as an operational C-Store, and is intended to be a guide of the likely pricing of our freehold properties.

Eastdil Secured’s opinion of pricing was arrived at using comparable transactional evidence of leasing and sales transactions
(without inspection of the underlying properties), adjusted to reflect the characteristics of the 952 convenience and fuel
properties and the store support campus, subject to a number of assumptions and limitations, including the ones identified
below:

  - Eastdil Secured did not make any third-party inquiries with respect to ownership and title, building structure and
condition, planning, environmental or other statutory information. Eastdil Secured assumed that there are no adverse
factors relating to these that would impact on pricing;

  - Eastdil Secured have not independently verified any of our sources of information and have assumed that
information provided by us to them is accurate and can, if necessary, be verified;

  - Eastdil Secured have assumed that there would be a willing lessor and willing lessee as well as a willing seller and a
purchaser in terms of demand for the properties in the open market;

  - Eastdil Secured’s opinions reflect appropriately sized institutional portfolio property pricing and no premium has
been applied on account of the properties being offered for sale to the market on an individual basis. Eastdil Secured
have assumed there would be an orderly disposal of the properties;

  - Eastdil Secured have assumed that freehold assets are free from any material landowner rent charge that may affect
pricing. If the properties should form part of a wider title, Eastdil Secured have assumed that they could be disposed
of independently and without restriction.


-----

  - Eastdil Secured have assumed that mixed interest assets are partially encumbered by a mix of nominal ground
leases, easements, or other lease payments;

  - Eastdil Secured have assumed all properties have valid planning permission and appropriate licensing for their
existing use;

  - Eastdil Secured have assumed that the properties are in a well maintained and in marketable condition and are
compliant with all building, accessibility and fire safety regulations;

  - Eastdil Secured have assumed that the properties have standard configuration appropriate to their use;

  - Eastdil Secured have assumed that full access and egress rights exist for the property, along with sufficient parking;

  - Eastdil Secured have assumed that the properties are connected to all main services including water, drainage,
electricity and telecommunications;

  - Eastdil Secured have assumed that there are no environmental issues such as contamination, flooding, ground
conditions, invasive or protected plants or species that would cause the properties to be inoperable.

  - Eastdil Secured have made certain assumptions around rental pricing, capital pricing and lease terms. In particular,
the Eastdil Report (as described above) presents four valuation scenarios on the basis of different methodologies,
supported by assumptions (i) on different rent coverages, which are the ratio of asset-level earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation, amortization, and rent costs (reduced by ground rent expense for leasehold assets)
(“EBITDAR”) for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 to the estimated year one sale-leaseback rent expense for
the portfolio (“Rent Coverage”), (ii) on pricing based on historical based rates, spreads and overall investor cost of
capital for approximately the last ten years and (iii) based on recent comparable transactions involving marketleading convenience and gas companies to determine enterprise value; and

  - Eastdil Secured have not deducted any costs for downtime during which the properties are not leased.

**_Reliance_**
Cushman & Wakefield and Eastdil Secured have accepted no responsibility whatsoever to any third party for the whole or any
part of the contents of the Real Estate Reports and as such no third party may rely upon the whole or any part of the Real Estate
Reports.

**_Footprint Expansion Strategy_**

We look to expand our footprint by identifying potential sites to knock down and rebuild, opening NTI sites and extending our
COCO model to additional sites. While selecting and developing each site, we pay close attention to land prices, which vary
significantly across locations, and consider several other factors, such as potential traffic flow and customer footfall, the ability
to set up or increase our Grocery & Merchandise or Foodservice offerings at each site, the existence of local competitors and
local amenities and the site’s potential profitability.

_Newly Acquired Sites and Land Banks_

We will selectively evaluate opportunities to expand our footprint by acquiring new sites, with acquisitions ranging in size
from single sites, to collections of multiple sites, to larger acquisitions of full businesses such as Cooplands, Kroger convenience
retail locations, FuelCo or Cumberland Farms. While we remain open to such acquisitions in the future if an attractive
opportunity presents itself, our current strategy is to focus on organic growth.

In addition, we acquire land banks in opportunistic locations where we would like to operate our business. Our timescale from
initial site selection at the land bank through to the prospective new site opening for business can range between one and three
years.

_“Knock-Down Rebuild” Sites_

We continue to identify potential sites for knock-down-rebuilds (“KDRs”, known as ‘raze-and-rebuilds’ in the United States),
as we have historically seen an uplift in the performance of knocked-down rebuilt sites. Based on our experience, an uplift in
a rebuilt site is typically achieved within one month of reopening the site and that uplift continues to improve over the next two
years. During each of 2022 and 2021, we undertook four KDRs, and in the six months ended June 30, 2023 we did not undertake
any KDRs.


-----

In the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, we spent $11.2 million on KDRs across the Group. Our timescale from closing an
existing site through to the KDR being completed is typically twelve to twenty weeks.

_New-to-Industry Sites_

In addition to acquiring new sites and rebuilding existing sites, we often set up new-to-industry (“NTI”) sites, which are new
sites that are opened in locations where no site existed before and thus where we would not have the opportunity to acquire
already operating businesses. Across our portfolio, we opened 31 NTI sites in 2022, 30 NTI sites in 2021 and 7 NTI sites in
the six months ended June 30, 2023.

In the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, we spent $129 million on NTI sites across the Group. Our timescale from initial
site selection through to the new-to-industry site opening for business generally ranges between one to three years.

**Employees**

As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 56,647 employees located across the regions in which we operate. Full-time
equivalents are calculated based on an analysis of the number of hours worked as of December 31, 2022 for which individual
personnel were actually paid, based on an assumed working week of forty hours and either four-or five-week months. Of these
employees, approximately 31,449 (or 56%) are located in Europe, approximately 20,368 (or 36%) are located in the United
States and approximately 4,823 (or 9%) are located in Australia.

In light of the seasonal nature of our industry, we also maintain a flexible workforce, including hourly, part-time and temporary
workers, which allows us to adjust staffing levels on relatively short notice to match anticipated demand at our sites.

We aim to be an employer of choice and are committed to ensuring colleagues are respected and their views are valued. We
keep an anti-bullying and anti-harassment policy, which is part of our employee handbook. We maintain appropriate training
and colleague communication programs and closely monitor employee activities to ensure that both strategy and colleague
engagement are aligned to keep us at the forefront of a competitive marketplace.

**_Works Councils and Trade Unions_**

We cooperate with local trade unions and work councils in countries where trade unions and/or work councils are active. In
these jurisdictions, we normally have framework agreements, tariff contracts or other general agreements in place, which are
agreed through discussions with the works councils and consider local labor laws. These agreements govern, among other
things, working conditions, working hours and the definition of tariff groups. These agreements can be negotiated for a limited
or unlimited term, and can be cancelled by either party in favor of renegotiation.

We believe we have good relationships with our employees and open and constructive working relationships with such
employee representation bodies across our various regions.

**_Employee Benefits_**

We operate various post-employment schemes across our Group companies, including both defined benefit and defined
contribution plans, including a retirement benefit plan, jubilee benefits for long years of service, a bridge pension plan for
employment terminated by us before the normal retirement date and other termination benefits payable when an employee
accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for certain benefits.

**Insurance**

Our Group-wide insurance coverage includes policies for risks associated with our business, including with respect to
environmental liabilities. These policies provide insurance cover for material property damage, material accidents and material
business interruption, in addition to standard corporate insurance, including crime and directors and officers insurance. We do
not currently maintain insurance coverage that is intended to address cybersecurity and data protection risks.

We believe that our insurance coverage is sufficient for the risks associated with our operations and that our policies are in
accordance with customary industry practices. However, there can be no guarantee that the coverage we maintain will be
sufficient to cover the cost of defense or other damages in the event of a significant claim. The nature of our business exposes
us to various liability claims which may exceed the level of our insurance.


-----

**Information Technology**

We own, operate and continue to invest in multiple IT systems, including servers, software products and licenses and
networking equipment located in multiple locations such as at tier 1 cloud providers, private data centers, our offices and our
sites. Our IT technology enables the management of products, pricing levels and stock as well as the recording of sales,
payments, including upcoming contactless payment systems, and waste levels for all of our sites. For example, we operate our
own pricing system using our Price Advantage software which we have improved with our own algorithms based on the data
we collect from our network of sites. Using own system of adapted pricing software in this way allows us to control fuel retail
pricing centrally, monitor fuel prices in real-time and adjust margins in line with volume gains and losses. It also allows us to
set daily site prices based on local competitor prices, price per liter targets and historical records per site on the impact of price
movements on volume. We then use our technology to automate prices for display on signs at integrated PFS sites in minutes.
Using our own system with our algorithms also provides operators with analytics capabilities to better understand prior pricing
behavior of suppliers and competitors and forecast future market movements.

Central reporting provides our management with tools and reports to oversee our business operations. Network and security
engineers are employed (on a full-time basis) to design, build, maintain and monitor our network and IT security position. We
use SAP Success Factors and site time and attendance biometric systems to manage and monitor staff utilization, schedules
and costs. For disaster recovery, we backup and replicate to alternative locations. We have invested in the latest products from
SAP ServiceNow and Microsoft to enhance the capabilities in the technology systems.

**Intellectual Property**

We own a number of trademarks important to our business. Our material trademarks are registered or pending applications for
registrations in various jurisdictions. There are no claims pending against us challenging our right to use any of our material
trademarks in any country.

We also have the authority to utilize trademarks and brands of the third parties with which we partner, pursuant to the terms of
our agreements with them.

**Regulation**

Our operations are directly subject to, and indirectly affected by, extensive regulation that varies from country to country and
region to region. These regulations govern, among other things, environmental, health and safety protection (including
regulations specific to the fuel market, such as for petroleum storage certificates, the management and disposal of hazardous
materials, air emissions and water discharge and the cleanup of contaminated sites), EV charging-related regulations, food
safety and labeling regulations, product quality, employee representation, minimum wage laws, privacy and data protection,
and tax laws in Europe, the United States and Australia. We may also assume regulatory liabilities and make provisions in
respect of our business combinations and acquisitions. We oversee regulatory obligations of acquired companies and use a
number of compliance management systems to align the policies and protocols of acquired companies with those of the Group,
where applicable. We have not been subject to any material fines or legal or regulatory action involving non-compliance with
applicable regulations and are unaware of any material non-compliance with or liability from relevant regulations.

**Health and Safety**

We are committed to maintaining the highest standards of health and safety practices for our colleagues, customers, visitors,
contractors and anyone affected by our business activities. We therefore consider good health, environment and safety
management as an essential part of the business performance and culture aiming for “ZERO accidents & incidents.” We
formally monitor health and safety incident rates. Our health and safety policies and procedures include, but are not limited to:

(1) Managing risk and promoting health and safety culture;

(2) Dedicated health & safety teams in every market in which we operate;

(3) Appropriate training for all employees to adhere to legal compliance and best practice;

(4) Proactively and regularly conducting regular risk assessments and root cause analyses to provide and
maintain safe and healthy working environments to reduce occupational injuries or illnesses;

(5) formal monitoring of health and safety incident rates via a procedure of logging and reporting incidents on a
software system; and


-----

(6) completing quarterly audits of health and safety performance.

We also have reporting systems and support functions for food and health and safety including:

1. Food Safety Managers;

2. Safety Managers;

3. Technical Advisers;

4. Quality Assurance Advisers; and

5. Primary Authority Partnerships (PAPs).

Health & Safety Committees are in place across the business for each region, reporting in the Group’s Health & Safety Manager,

our business. Our policy in this regard reflects our commitment to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business

**Litigation**

We have been and, from time to time, may continue to become a party to claims and lawsuits incidental to the ordinary course
of our business. On April 1, 2022, we resolved our Australian Federal Court proceedings with Ampol relating to a fuel supply
agreement that was novated from Woolworths to EG in 2019. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, it was decided that Ampol
would be the exclusive supplier to all stores within our Australian network under a fuel supply agreement on updated
commercial terms. Both parties also agreed to discontinue their claims against the other party. The updated commercial terms
resulted in a decrease in the carrying value of provisions by $43 million.

In addition, we often also assume liabilities and make provisions in respect of acquisitions. Where claims or lawsuits are
introduced against any of our Group companies, we review them to determine whether provisions are required to be made for
them and in what amounts. We are not aware of any material litigation pending or threatened against any Group company.

**Remuneration**

The Remuneration Committee is composed of Lord Stuart Rose (Chair), appointed on an interim basis until a permanent

responsibilities of the Nomination Committee include:

performance criteria are fair and rewarding of successful performance and are sufficiently balanced to include financial
and non-financial key performance indicators. As a private limited business, the remit of the Remuneration Committee

**Conflicts of Interest**

Other than as described below, no director has a conflict of interest (actual or potential) between his or her duties to the Group
and his or her private interests and/or other duties:

(a) Zuber Issa, Mohsin Issa, Gary Lindsay, and Manjit Dale were nominated for appointment as directors of
Asda Group Limited, which is a retailer and petrol forecourt operator. Since each of Zuber Issa, Mohsin Issa,
Gary Lindsay, and Manjit Dale has been nominated by Asda Group Limited, and since the interests of Asda
Group Limited may not be aligned with the Group’s interests, a conflict of interest might arise. For example,
a potential conflict of interest between the Group and each of Zuber Issa, Mohsin Issa, Gary Lindsay, and
Manjit Dale could arise where a decision that would contribute to the success of the Group would negatively
impact the success of Asda Group Limited.

(b) Zuber Issa, Mohsin Issa, Dame Alison Carnwath, Gary Lindsay, Manjit Dale, and Lord Stuart Rose were
nominated as directors of Bellis Topco 2 Limited, a shareholder of Asda Group Limited. Since each of Zuber
Issa, Mohsin Issa, Dame Alison Carnwath, Gary Lindsay, Manjit Dale, and Lord Stuart Rose has been
nominated by Bellis Topco 2 Limited, and since the interests of Bellis Topco 2 Limited may not be aligned
with the Group’s interests, a conflict of interest might arise. For example, a potential conflict of interest
between the Group and each of Zuber Issa, Mohsin Issa, Dame Alison Carnwath, Gary Lindsay, Manjit Dale,
and Lord Stuart Rose could arise where a decision that would contribute to the success of the Group would
impact the share price of Asda Group Limited and thus the shareholding in Asda Group Limited attributed
to Bellis Topco 2 Limited.

(c) Zuber Issa and Mohsin Issa were nominated for appointment as directors and are shareholders of Monte
Group (Jersey) Ltd, a property investment and development company. Since each of Zuber Issa and Mohsin
Issa were nominated by Monte Group (Jersey) Ltd, and are shareholders of the same, and since the interests
of Monte Group (Jersey) Ltd may not be aligned with the Group’s interests, a conflict of interest may arise.

(d) Dame Alison Carnwath is a director of PACCAR Inc., a trucks and lorries manufacturer. PACCAR Inc. is
currently transitioning from power trains which are diesel-based to battery electric gas and hydrogen-based
mobility solutions. Since Dame Alison Carnwath is a director of PACCAR Inc., and since the interests of
PACCAR Inc. may not be aligned with the Group’s interests, a conflict of interest between the Group and


-----

Dame Alison Carnwath may arise. For example, a conflict of interest could arise where a decision that would
contribute to the success of the Group would negatively impact the success of PACCAR Inc.

(e) John Carey is a shareholder of Griphero Inc, a manufacturer and retailer of hand-protection systems that are
fitted on fuel pump handles fitted on fuel pump handles used on forecourts. In the year ended December 31,
2022, the Group’s made purchases worth $443,000 from Griphero Inc. Since John Carey is a shareholder of
Griphero Inc., and since the Group is a purchaser of Griphero Inc. products, a conflict may arise.

(f) Lord Stuart Rose was nominated for appointment as director of Zenith Automotive Holdings Limited, a
vehicle leasing and asset management company. Since Lord Stuart Rose is a director of Zenith Automotive
Holdings Limited, and since the Group leases vehicles from Zenith Automotive Holdings Limited, a conflict
may arise where a decision that would contribute to the success of the Group would negatively impact the
success of Zenith Automotive Holdings Limited.

The Board does not expect that the circumstances described above will cause any of the directors to have a conflict with the
duties they owe to the Group. However, our board regulations as well as our related party transactions policy include
arrangements to ensure that the Board will in each relevant situation handle and decide on any (potential) conflict of interest.

**Compensation**

The aggregate remuneration paid by us to our key management personnel, including the directors, for the year ended
December 31, 2022 was $6.6 million, comprising short-term employee benefits and share-based payments charges. The amount
paid by us to our highest paid director for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $0.6 million, comprising short-term employee
benefits. None of our key management personnel, including the directors, are members of any of our defined benefit pension
schemes or money purchase schemes.

In June 2021, the Parent’s indirect parent Company, EG Holdings, issued non-voting redeemable fixed return management
shares in EG Holdings to the non-executive directors. A total of six management shares have been issued at a nominal value of
£178,571 per share, with the return tied to the growth in the equity value of the Group, subject to certain return hurdles. During

**Shareholders’ Arrangements**

On May 2, 2018, Zuber Vali Issa, Mohsin Issa, Optima Bidco and Optima Group S.à r.l., among others, entered into a
shareholders’ agreement (the “Shareholders’ Agreement”), which governs various rights of the shareholders of Optima Bidco
in relation to their direct shareholding in Optima Bidco and indirect shareholding in the Group. The Shareholders’ Agreement
was amended and restated on October 8, 2019 in connection with the issuance of preference shares, subsequently amended on
February 19, 2020 and amended again on November 11, 2020 in connection with a further issuance of preference shares.

Pursuant to the Shareholders’ Agreement, both Zuber Issa and Mohsin Issa, acting through Optima Bidco (Jersey) Limited (the
“Individual Shareholders”), on the one hand, and TDR Capital, acting through Optima Group S.à r.l. (the “TDR Shareholder”),
on the other hand, are entitled to appoint or remove directors in certain circumstances. Each of the Individual Shareholders and
the TDR Shareholder are entitled to appoint and remove (i) two members of the board of directors of Optima Bidco and each
member of the Group so long as such shareholder, together with its affiliates, together hold 35% or more of the share capital
of Optima Bidco, and (ii) one member of the board of directors of Optima Bidco and each member of the Group so long as
such shareholder, together with its affiliates, together hold between 15% and 35% of the share capital of Optima Bidco. The

of the Individual Shareholders and the TDR Shareholder, as summarized below, all decisions of the board of directors may be
made by a majority of the votes cast.

The Shareholders’ Agreement provides that certain actions in relation to the Group may not be taken without the consent of
either of the Individual Shareholders (or any of the directors appointed by them) and the TDR Shareholder (or any of the
directors appointed by it). These include amendments to the organizational documents of any member of the Group, variations
to the rights attaching to the shares in any member of the Group, the declaration or payment of any dividend or distribution by
any Group company (other than to Optima Bidco or another Group company which is wholly-owned by Optima Bidco), a
material change in the nature or scope of the Group’s business and the winding up or dissolution of Optima Bidco or any other
Group company.

The Shareholders’ Agreement contains certain restrictions on the transfer by any shareholder of its shares in Optima Bidco or
any other member of the Group, including an obligation on the Individual Shareholders and the TDR Shareholder to first offer
any shares to the other before offering them for sale to a third party.

The TDR Shareholder is entitled to control the timing and manner of any exit event involving Optima Bidco, including the sale
of its shares in Optima Bidco; the sale by Optima Bidco or any other member of the Group of all or substantially all of its

**CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS**
We enter into transactions with our shareholders, other entities owned by, or affiliated with, our direct and indirect shareholders,
and joint ventures and associates in the ordinary course of business. These transactions include, among other things, the sale
and purchase of real estate. See “Risk Factors— _We may enter into transactions with related parties on terms that are less_
_favorable to us than would be the case if such transactions had not been with related parties.” We believe that these transactions_
with our affiliated entities were made in the ordinary course of business, on fair terms and at arm’s length. We may, from time
to time, enter into similar arrangements with affiliated entities in the ordinary course of business and on terms that we believe
are no less favorable than those that could reasonably have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated party.

Our related party policy, adopted pursuant to IAS 24 and the Companies Act, requires any individuals who hold significant
control or influence, or key management personnel, to avoid situations where they have potential or actual conflicts of interest,
declare any potential or actual conflicts of interest, and declare any interest in an existing transaction or arrangement. The
Group General Counsel & Company Secretary undertakes reviews of the disclosure to determine any potential or actual
conflicts with a related party that may require approval from the Board pursuant to the Companies Act, our articles of
association, and any applicable legislation or regulation. Where a potential or actual conflict or related party transaction arises,
details are recorded and reported to the Board. The Board reviews all relevant information and either approves or disapproves
entry into the related party transaction, based on whether the transaction is, in good faith, not inconsistent with the interests of
the Group and its shareholders.

The following discussion is a brief summary of certain material arrangements, agreements and transactions we have with related
parties.

Revolving Credit Facilities (as applicable). If the aggregate of the Daily Rate and the applicable Credit Adjustment Spread with
respect to sterling is less than zero, the Daily Rate shall be deemed to be such a rate that the aggregate of the Daily Rate and
the applicable Credit Adjustment Spread is zero in respect of loans made under the Senior Term Facilities denominated in
sterling and the Revolving Credit Facilities (as applicable). If the aggregate of the Daily Rate and the applicable Credit
Adjustment Spread with respect to USD is less than zero or less than 0.5 per cent. (as applicable), the Daily Rate shall be
deemed to be such a rate that the aggregate of the Daily Rate and the applicable Credit Adjustment Spread is zero or 0.5 per
cent. (as applicable) in respect of loans made under the Senior Term Facilities and the Revolving Credit Facilities (as applicable)
denominated in USD.

A commitment fee will be payable on the aggregate undrawn and uncancelled amount of the Revolving Credit Facility from
the Additional Facility Commencement Date applicable to the relevant Revolving Credit Facility to the end of the availability
period each as applicable to the Revolving Credit Facility at a rate of 35% of the applicable margin for the Revolving Credit
Facility. Commitment fees will be payable quarterly in arrears and on the date the Revolving Credit Facility is cancelled in full
or on the date on which the relevant lender cancels its commitment.

A fronting fee of 0.125% is payable on the outstanding exposure under each letter of credit under each Letter of Credit Facility
(other than the Murray Letter of Credit Facility, with respect to which a 0.4% fronting fee is payable) which is counter
indemnified by other lenders (which are not affiliates of the relevant fronting bank) and which is not cash collateralized, repaid,
prepaid or cancelled, for the period from the issue of the relevant letter of credit until its expiry date (or the date of its repayment,
prepayment or cancellation, if earlier), and a letter of credit fee computed at the rate equal to (x) prior to the Conditions
Satisfaction Date, 2% per annum, or (y) on or after the Conditions Satisfaction Date, 3% per annum, is payable on the
outstanding amount of each letter of credit under the relevant Letter of Credit Facility for the period from the issue of the
relevant letter of credit until its expiry date (or the date of its cancellation, if earlier).

Default interest will be calculated as an additional 1% on the defaulted amount.

A ticking fee is payable in respect of the Tranche C Term Facilities within 10 business days of the occurrence of the Conditions
Satisfaction Date, computed by reference to each lender’s commitments under the Tranche C Term Facilities as at June 30,
2023 for the period commencing on (and including) the date of allocation of the Tranche C Term Facilities and ending on (but
excluding) the Conditions Satisfaction Date and equal to the difference between the margin applicable prior to, and following,
the occurrence of the Conditions Satisfaction Date. No ticking fee shall be payable if the Conditions Satisfaction Date does not
occur.


-----

A ticking fee is payable in respect of Tranche D Term Facilities within 10 business days of the occurrence of the date of first
utilization of the Tranche D Term Facilities (“Tranche D Closing Date”), computed by reference to each lender’s commitments
under the Tranche D Term Facilities, for the period commencing on the date of allocation of the Tranche D Term Facilities and
ending on the Tranche D Closing Date, and the number of days that have elapsed since the date of allocation of the Tranche D
Term Facilities. No ticking fee shall be payable if the Tranche D Closing Date does not occur.

In connection with the Amend and Extend and the utilization of Tranche D Term Facilities, we will pay certain fees costs and
expenses totaling $170 million.

**_Repayments_**

The loans made under Senior Term Facilities which are term loan facilities will be repaid in instalments by repaying on each
Quarter Date an amount which reduces the aggregate loans under the Senior Term Facilities drawn during the availability
period by 0.25 per cent.

The aggregate principal amount of any (a) Tranche A Term Facility Loan(s) (other than any Tranche A Becker Additional
Term Facility Loan(s)) still outstanding on February 7, 2025, and (b) Tranche A Becker Additional Term Facility Loan(s) still
outstanding on March 31, 2026, in each case, shall be repaid in full on that date (as applicable).

The aggregate principal amount of any (a) Tranche B Term Facility Loan(s) (other than any Tranche B Becker Additional Term
Facility Loan(s)) still outstanding on February 7, 2025, and (b) Tranche B Becker Additional Term Facility Loan(s) still
outstanding on March 31, 2026, in each case, shall be repaid in full on that date (as applicable).

The aggregate principal amount of any (a) Tranche C Term Facility Loan(s) (other than any Tranche C Becker Additional Term
Facility Loan(s)) still outstanding on February 7, 2025, and (b) Tranche C Becker Additional Term Facility Loan(s) still
outstanding on March 31, 2026, in each case, shall be repaid in full on that date (as applicable), _provided that, upon the_
occurrence of the Conditions Satisfaction Date, but subject to the conditions set out below, the termination date applicable to
any Tranche C Term Facility Loans(s) shall be extended to February 7, 2028 (the “Extended Termination Date”). The Extended
Termination Date is subject to a springing maturity mechanic, whereby, if, at a date (the “Determination Date”) that is four
months prior to the maturity date of any outstanding Specified Indebtedness (as defined in the additional facility notice for that
Senior Term Facility, and which includes maturity dates between February 2025 to April 2027) which is in an aggregate amount
that, together with any outstanding Specified Indebtedness in respect of a prior Determination Date, exceeds $250,000,000.00
(or its equivalent in other currencies) and such amount in excess of $250,000,000.00 is not repaid, refinanced (with debt that
has a maturity date falling at least 91 days after the Extended Termination Date) or extended (to a maturity date falling at least
91 days after the Extended Termination Date) by such Determination Date, the Extended Termination Date shall be
automatically adjusted to the maturity date of the relevant Specified Indebtedness (as defined in the additional facility notice
for that Senior Term Facility) or, if the Specified Indebtedness is in respect of the April 2027 2L Facility (as defined in the
additional facility notice for that Senior Term Facility), 91 days prior to the maturity date applicable to the April 2027 2L
Facility.

The aggregate principal amount of any Tranche D Term Facilities Loan(s) still outstanding on February 7, 2028 shall be repaid
in full on that date, subject to the same springing maturity mechanic applicable to Tranche C Term Facility Loans. Once
operative, the aggregate principal amount of any Tranche E Term Facilities Loan(s) still outstanding on February 7, 2028 shall
be repaid in full on that date, subject to the same springing maturity mechanic applicable to Tranche C Term Facility Loans.

In respect of the Revolving Credit Facilities, each advance will be repaid on the last day of the interest period relating thereto,
subject to an ability to roll over cash drawings. Amounts repaid by the borrowers on loans made under the Revolving Credit
Facilities may be reborrowed, subject to certain conditions. All outstanding amounts under each Revolving Credit Facility and
each Letter of Credit Facility will be repaid on August 31, 2024 _provided that, upon the occurrence of the Conditions_
Satisfaction Date, but subject to the conditions set out below, the termination date applicable to each Extended Revolving
Credit Facility and each Extended Letter of Credit Facility shall be extended to August 31, 2027 (the “RCF/LC Extended
Termination Date”). The RCF/LC Extended Termination Date is subject to a springing maturity mechanic, whereby, if, at a
date that is (a) four months prior to the maturity date of any Specified Indebtedness (as defined in the additional facility notice
for that Extended Revolving Credit Facility, and which includes maturity dates between February 2025 to April 2027), such
outstanding Specified Indebtedness is not repaid, refinanced (with debt that has a maturity date falling at least 91 days after the
RCF/LC Extended Termination Date) or extended (to a maturity date falling at least 91 days after the RCF/LC Extended
Termination Date), the RCF/LC Extended Termination Date shall be automatically adjusted to such date falling 91 days prior
to the maturity date of the relevant Specified Indebtedness (as defined in the additional facility notice for that Extended
Revolving Credit Facility), or (b) seven months prior to the maturity of the April 2027 2L Facility (as defined in the additional
facility notice for that Extended Revolving Credit Facility), such amount outstanding under the April 2027 2L Facility is not


-----

repaid, refinanced (with debt that has a maturity date at least 182 days after the RCF/LC Extended Termination Date) or
extended (to a maturity date falling at least 182 days after the RCF/LC Extended Termination Date), the RCF/LC Extended
Termination Date shall be automatically adjusted to the date falling 182 days prior to the maturity date applicable to the April
2027 2L Facility.

**_Mandatory Prepayment_**

The Senior Credit Facilities Agreement will permit mandatory prepayment in full or in part in certain circumstances on at least
a pro rata basis together with any other Indebtedness ranking pari passu with the Senior Credit Facilities, including:

  - on an initial public offering which does not constitute a change of control (with the percentage of proceeds to be
prepaid subject to a ratchet based on the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio) (a “Listing Prepayment”); and

  - unless otherwise agreed by the majority lenders under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, for each financial year
(beginning with the financial year commencing on January 1, 2018), a percentage of excess cash flow in the event that
excess cash flow exceeds a minimum threshold amount, which percentage decreases as the Senior Secured Net
Leverage Ratio decreases (an “Excess Cash Flow Prepayment”).

Upon the occurrence of a change of control (as defined in the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement) or an initial public offering
which results in a change of control, each lender shall be entitled to require prepayment of its commitments within a prescribed
time period. A change of control shall include:

  - any person or group becoming the beneficial owner of more than 50% of the voting power of the Parent, subject to
certain conditions;

  - on a disposal of substantially all of the assets of the Group.

At the election of the Parent, amounts required to be prepaid pursuant to a Listing Prepayment or an Excess Cash Flow
Prepayment may instead be applied in repayment of any other indebtedness of the Group ranking pari passu with the Senior
Term Facilities.

**_Guarantees and Security_**

_Guarantor Coverage Test_

The Senior Credit Facilities are currently guaranteed by the Guarantors, EG Holdings (France) SAS and EG Retail (France)
SAS, and are secured by the Collateral and by security interests over certain assets of EG Holdings (France) SAS and EG Retail
(France) SAS.

Subject to certain adjustments and agreed security principles in the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, the Parent is required
to ensure that members of the Group that generate at least 80% of Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the section entitled
“Description of the Notes”) and that hold at least 80% of the aggregate gross assets of the Group are guarantors (the “Guarantor
_Coverage Test”) under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement within 60 days of the date on which the annual financial_
statements of the Parent are required to be delivered to the agent under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement.

Subject to certain adjustments and agreed security principles in the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, the Parent was required
to ensure that material real property representing at last 85% of the total aggregate net book value of the material real property
located in the United Kingdom was subject to Transaction Security no later than sixty (60) days following February 7, 2018
and that any material real property acquired by any member of the Group is made subject to Transaction Security within six
(6) months of the acquisition thereof, _provided that for these purposes, material real property is defined as (i) freehold or_
heritable property with a reinstatement value in excess of £1.0 million, and (ii) any leasehold property (including any ground
lease and building rights) that has an unexpired term of twenty-five (25) years or more from February 7, 2018 or, if acquired
after February 7, 2018, from the acquisition of such leasehold property interest (and excluding any leasehold property in respect
of which a rack rent is payable), in each case that is located in the United Kingdom and excluding any unregistered real property
which, if subject to any security, would be required to be registered under the relevant land registry laws (provided that such
real property shall only be excluded for so long as it remains unregistered).


-----

_Release of Guarantees and Security_

In addition to the circumstances described below under “Intercreditor Agreement—Distressed Disposals” and “Intercreditor
_Agreement—Non-Distressed Disposals,” the Parent may, subject to certain conditions, request the release of a Guarantor (other_
than the Parent or the Company) from its guarantee under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement if (i) such Guarantor is the
subject of a third party disposal or other permitted activity under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement pursuant to which such
Guarantor will cease to be a member of the Group, (ii) on a pro forma basis taking into account such release, the Guarantor
Coverage Test will continue to be satisfied, (iii) the lenders whose commitments under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement
aggregate 80% or more of the total commitments under such facilities have consented to the resignation of that Guarantor or
(iv) if the resignation is contemplated by a tax structure memorandum delivered in accordance with the Acquisitions. Upon the
effectiveness of a release pursuant to the foregoing sentence, the applicable Guarantor would have no further obligations under
the Finance Documents, including any obligations to grant Security in any Collateral owned by such Guarantor.

The provision and the terms of the security and guarantees set forth above will in all cases be subject to certain limitations and
are at all times and in all cases subject to the requirements of applicable law and the other matters set forth in the Intercreditor
Agreement and the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement.

**_Representations and Warranties_**

Certain representations and warranties were made on the date of the Senior Credit Facility Agreement and will be repeated on
the date of each utilization request, the date of each utilization, on the first day of each interest period and at certain other times.

**_Covenants_**

The Senior Credit Facilities Agreement contains certain of the incurrence covenants, information undertakings and related
definitions (with, in each case, certain adjustments and exceptions) that are set forth in the Indenture, including (i) limitations
on indebtedness; (ii) limitations on restricted payments; (iii) limitations on liens (which includes a restriction on designating
certain credit facilities and/or hedging obligations secured on the Collateral as Super Senior Liabilities (as defined in the section
entitled “—Intercreditor Agreement”)); (iv) limitation on restrictions on distributions from restricted subsidiaries;
(v) limitations on sale of assets and subsidiary stock; (vi) limitations on affiliate transactions; (vii) merger and consolidation;
(viii) limited condition acquisition and irrevocable payment; and (ix) IPO pushdown.

Under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, following the Conditions Satisfaction Date, the covenant titled “Limitation on
Sale of Assets and Subsidiary Stock” will contain certain restrictions for any Asset Disposition above the greater of €10 million
and 0.25% of Total Assets. In particular, in relation to any Asset Disposition (including any Sale and Leaseback Transaction),
within sixty (60) days, the Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, shall apply an amount equal to (x) if, after
giving _pro forma effect to such Asset Disposition and the receipt of Net Available Cash therefrom, the Consolidated Net_
Leverage Ratio for the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries is greater than 4.50 to 1.00, 100 per cent. of such Net Available
Cash or (y) if, after giving pro forma effect to such Asset Disposition and the receipt of Net Available Cash therefrom, the
Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio for the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries is equal to or less than 4.50 to 1.00, no less than
75 per cent. of such Net Available Cash to repay certain indebtedness of the Group (including, among others: (i) indebtedness
incurred under the credit facilities basket set out in the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement; (ii) indebtedness of a Restricted
Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor; and (iii) pari passu indebtedness secured on a first-lien basis), as described in the Senior
Credit Facilities Agreement. In relation to any Asset Disposition (including any Sale and Leaseback Transaction), if, after
giving _pro forma effect to such Asset Disposition and the receipt of Net Available Cash therefrom, the Consolidated Net_
Leverage Ratio for the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries is equal to or less than 4.50 to 1.00, the Parent or such Restricted
Subsidiary, as the case may be, may apply any portion of such Net Available Cash that has not been applied in accordance with
the preceding sentence, towards the investment in Additional Assets or the making of capital expenditures, or a combination


-----

of the two, as described in the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement (with each of the foregoing defined terms in this paragraph
as defined in the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement).

In addition, the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement also requires the Parent and certain of its restricted subsidiaries to observe
certain other customary positive and negative covenants, subject to certain exceptions and grace periods, including covenants
relating to: (i) authorizations and consents; (ii) compliance with laws; (iii) pari passu ranking; (iv) insurances; (v) payment of
taxes; (vi) pension schemes; (vii) provision of guarantees and security and further assurance; (viii) compliance with sanctions
and anti-corruption laws; (ix) ERISA, Federal Reserve Regulations and U.S. regulations; (x) maintenance of ratings;
(xi) holding company; (xii) people with significant control; (xiii) annual and quarterly financial statements; and
(xiv) compliance certificates.

Prior to the Conditions Satisfaction Date, solely for the benefit of the lenders participating in a Revolving Credit Facility, the
Senior Credit Facilities Agreement requires that, in the event that the aggregate amount of all cash loans drawn under the
relevant Revolving Credit Facility (excluding any utilizations by way of letters of credit (or bank guarantees) or ancillary
facilities or any amounts utilized to fund any original issue discount or flex related payments, fees or expenses) exceeds 40%
of the total commitments under the Revolving Credit Facilities on the relevant testing date or, if higher, the sum of the total
commitments under each Revolving Credit Facility as at the original date of its establishment (the “Revolving Test Condition”),
the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio does not exceed 8.80 to 1.00 (the “Financial Covenant”). The Senior Secured Net
Leverage Ratio is based on the definitions and adjustments in the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, which may differ from
similar definitions in the Indenture and the equivalent definitions described in this offering memorandum. On and from the
Conditions Satisfaction Date, in addition to being for the benefit of the lenders participating in a Revolving Credit Facility, the
Financial Covenant shall also be extended for the benefit of the lenders participating in an Letter of Credit Facility expressed
to benefit from such financial covenant.

The Senior Credit Facilities Agreement contains an equity cure provision enabling the shareholders of the Parent to make
shareholder injections by way of debt and/or equity to the Parent to (i) increase the consolidated pro forma EBITDA under the
Senior Credit Facilities Agreement (an “EBITDA Cure”), (ii) decrease consolidated senior secured net debt as defined in the
Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, or (iii) prepay the relevant Revolving Credit Facility so that the Revolving Test Condition
is no longer satisfied. The EBITDA Cure right may not be exercised on more than two occasions during the term of the Senior
Credit Facilities. The equity cure rights may not be exercised on more than five occasions during the term of the Senior Credit
Facilities, may not be exercised on more than two occasions in any financial year and may not be exercised in consecutive
financial quarters.

Prior to the Conditions Satisfaction Date, it is intended that certain agreed covenants and other provisions of the Senior Credit
Facilities Agreement will fall away on the satisfaction of certain release conditions, being (i) the occurrence of a listing (which
does not constitute a change of control) where the Group’s Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio (adjusted as if the proceeds of
that listing have been or will be applied in prepayment of the facilities) does not exceed 4.00:1; (ii) the Parent (or any holding
company of the Parent) having a long-term corporate credit rating equal to or better than Baa3 according to Moody’s Investor
Services Limited or BBB- according to Standard & Poor’s Rating Services; or (iii) the Senior Term Facilities (and any
additional facilities which are term loan facilities) have achieved and maintained investment-grade status. On and from the
Conditions Satisfaction Date, the intended fall away provisions mentioned above shall cease to be operative, such that certain
agreed covenants and other provisions of the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement will not fall away on the satisfaction of the
release conditions referred to in sub-paragraphs (i) through (iii) above.

**_Events of Default_**

The Senior Credit Facilities Agreement provides for substantially the same events of default as under the Notes. In addition,
the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement provides for additional events of default, subject to customary materiality qualifications
and grace periods, including (i) breach of the financial covenant subject to cure rights, provided that, in the event of such breach
which is not cured, (x) prior to the Conditions Satisfaction Date, only a majority of the lenders under each Revolving Credit
Facility shall initially be entitled to take enforcement action, or (y) on and from the Conditions Satisfaction Date, in addition
to the majority lenders under each Revolving Credit Facility, a majority of the lenders under each Letter of Credit Facility
expressed to benefit from such financial covenant shall initially be entitled to take enforcement action; (ii) inaccuracy of a
representation or statement when made; (iii) invalidity and unlawfulness of the Senior Credit Facilities financing documents;
and (iv) material failure to comply with the Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Governing Law_**

The Senior Credit Facilities Agreement and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with it, are governed
by, construed in accordance with and will be enforced in accordance with English law although the information undertakings,


-----

restrictive covenants, events of default and related definitions scheduled to the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement will be
interpreted in accordance with New York law (without prejudice to the fact that the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement is
governed by English law).

portion of the Existing Cirrus Notes. See “Summary—Recent Developments—Senior Credit Facilities Prepayment and Existing
_Notes Redemption.”_

_Terms of the Existing Notes_

The Existing Cirrus Notes and the Existing Murray Notes (together, the “Existing Notes”) benefit from substantially the same
guarantees and security as the Notes on an equal and ratable basis and subject to the same conditions and timing requirements.
However, the Existing Murray Notes are guaranteed by, and are secured by security interests over certain assets of, EG Holdings
(France) SAS and EG Retail (France) SAS, which do not guarantee or secure the Existing Cirrus Notes or the Notes, due to
exceptions linked to applicable French legal corporate benefit and other rules, as reflected in the Agreed Security Principles.

The guarantees benefitting the Existing Notes are provided by the same entities that guarantee, or will guarantee, the Notes,
the Senior Credit Facilities and the Second Lien Credit Facilities except for EG Holdings (France) SAS and EG Retail (France)


-----

SAS, which will not guarantee the Notes and do not guarantee the Existing Cirrus Notes. Accordingly, obligations in respect
of the Existing Note guarantees rank pari passu in right of payment to those guarantors’ obligations in respect of Notes, the
Senior Credit Facilities and the Second Lien Credit Facilities.

The security interests benefitting the Existing Notes, as applicable, are subject to limitations under applicable laws and may be
released under certain circumstances.

We have agreed to observe certain covenants with respect to the Existing Notes including limitations on dividend distributions
and other payments, indebtedness, asset sales, liens, guarantees, mergers and consolidations. In case of a change of control,
(including, among others, if all or substantially all of the properties or assets of the Issuer and certain of its subsidiaries taken
as a whole are sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of, or if any person acquires the majority of voting power of the Issuer),
holders of the Existing Notes have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase all or any part of their Existing Notes at a
purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Existing Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to
the date of purchase. In the event of certain asset sales, after which the proceeds are not reinvested in the form envisaged by
the Existing Indenture and as a result of which such proceeds exceed €70 million, the Issuer is required to make an offer to
repurchase the Existing Notes, as applicable, at 100% of the principal amount.

The Existing Notes contain various events of default, including, among others, non-payment, breach of certain covenants,
breach of other obligations set forth in the Existing Indenture, any security interest under the security document in an amount
greater than €100 million ceases to be in full force and effect after a grace period of 10 days, any guarantees of a Significant
Subsidiary cease to be in full force and effect, a cross-default in relation to certain indebtedness aggregating €150 million or
more at any time outstanding not being paid prior to the expiration of the grace period provided in such indebtedness or
indebtedness becoming due and payable before its specified maturity, failure to pay final judgments in excess of €150 million
following a grace period, and certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency, the occurrence of which, with respect to certain
events of default, would result in the Existing Notes becoming due and payable or, with respect to certain other events of
default, would allow holders of the Existing Notes to declare the Existing Notes due and payable.

The offerings of the Existing Notes were not registered under the Securities Act or any U.S. state securities laws. The Existing
Notes were offered and sold within the United States only to qualified institutional buyers as defined in Rule 144A under the
Securities Act and to non-U.S. persons outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act. The
Existing Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange.

**Second Lien Credit Facilities Agreement**

**_Overview and Structure_**

The Parent, on April 6, 2018, entered into the Second Lien Credit Facilities Agreement (as amended and restated pursuant to
an amendment and restatement agreement dated December 24, 2021) with, among others, Barclays Bank PLC as agent and the
security agent, and Bank of America Merrill Lynch International Limited, Barclays Bank PLC, Deutsche Bank AG, London
Branch, Lloyds Bank plc, Morgan Stanley Bank International Limited and UBS Europe SE (formerly UBS Limited), as
mandated lead arrangers. On March 21, 2021, the Parent, together with EG Finco Limited as the borrower and Barclays Bank
PLC as the additional facility lender and the agent, entered into the Second Lien Additional Facility Notice. The Second Lien
Additional Facility Notice, established pursuant to the Second Lien Credit Facilities Agreement, provided for a second lien
term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of €610,000,000.00 (the “Additional Second Lien Facility”for the purposes
of this description). The Additional Second Lien Facility refinanced all other facilities incurred pursuant to the Second Lien
Credit Facilities Agreement such that from the date of establishment of the Additional Second Lien Facility, the Additional
Second Lien Facility constitutes the only indebtedness outstanding pursuant to the Second Lien Credit Facilities Agreement.
As described under the heading “Capitalization”, the U.S. dollar-equivalent amount of indebtedness outstanding under the
Second Lien Credit Facilities Agreement (as supplemented by the Second Lien Additional Facility Notice) as of June 30, 2023
is $663 million.

The Additional Second Lien Facility has been utilized by EG Finco Limited and was originally applied in or towards (directly
or indirectly): (i) satisfaction of the consideration payable for (x) the acquisition by Euro Garages Limited of certain shares (the
“Asda Forecourt Target“) sold by Bellis Property Newco Limited pursuant to an acquisition agreement dated 3 February

**Intercreditor Agreement**

**_General_**

To establish the relative rights of certain of our creditors under our financing arrangements, each of the Parent the Guarantors,
the Issuer and the Trustee are party to an Intercreditor Agreement originally dated February 6, 2018 between, among others,
the Parent, the agent, arrangers and lenders under each of the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement and the Second Lien Credit
Facilities Agreement and the Security Agent.

By accepting a Note, holders of the Notes will be deemed to have agreed to, and accepted the terms and conditions of, the
Intercreditor Agreement.

The Intercreditor Agreement is governed by English law and sets out various matters governing the relationship of the creditors
to our group including the relative ranking of certain debt of the Issuer, the Guarantors and any other person that becomes party
to the Intercreditor Agreement as a Debtor or Third Party Security Provider, when payments can be made in respect of debt of
the Debtors or Third Party Security Providers, when enforcement action can be taken in respect of that debt, the terms pursuant
to which certain of that debt will be subordinated upon the occurrence of certain insolvency events and turnover provisions and
provisions related to the enforcement of shared security.

The following description is a summary of certain provisions contained in the Intercreditor Agreement. It does not restate the
Intercreditor Agreement in its entirety and we urge you to read that document because it, and not the discussion that follows,
defines certain rights of the holders of the Notes and of the Trustee. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the
meanings given to them in the Intercreditor Agreement.

For the purposes of this description:

References to the “Senior Secured Notes” shall include the Notes and any other notes, securities or other debt instruments
issued or to be issued by or in relation to which a New Debt Financing (as defined below) has been made available to or by a
member of the Group which are designated by the Parent as Senior Secured Notes under the Intercreditor Agreement and
references to the “Topco Notes” shall include any notes, securities or other debt instruments issued or to be issued by or in
relation to which a New Debt Financing has been made available to or by a Topco Borrower (as defined below) which are
designated by the Parent as Topco Notes.

“Senior Secured Notes Liabilities” to refer to the Notes and certain other indebtedness of the Issuer.

required by the Intercreditor Agreement shall not prevent the occurrence of an event of default under such applicable Senior
Secured Finance Documents.

Prior to the date which is the later of the Super Senior Discharge Date and the Senior Secured Discharge Date, the Parent, the
Issuer, Third Party Security Providers and other members of the Group may only make specified scheduled payments (including

amount is outstanding as a result of the accrual of cash interest payable in respect of the Second Lien
Liabilities during such period or any such amount described at (i)(C) above, provided that no such payment
may be made if certain events of default have occurred or would occur as a result of making such payment,
(H) for as long as an event of default under the Senior Secured Liabilities or Second Lien Liabilities is
continuing, all or part of the Second Lien Liabilities being released or otherwise discharged solely in
consideration for the issues of shares in any holding company of the Parent or Topco (a “Debt for Equity
Swap”) provided that no cash or cash equivalent payment is made in respect of the Second Lien Liabilities,
that it does not result in a Change of Control (as defined in any prior ranking finance agreement) and that any
liabilities under the Debt Documents owed by a member of the Group to another member of the Group, to
the Subordinated Creditors or to any other holding company of the Parent that arise as a result of any such
Debt for Equity Swap are subordinated to the Senior Secured Liabilities pursuant to the Intercreditor
Agreement and the Senior Secured Creditors are granted Transaction Security in respect of any of those
liabilities under the Debt Documents owed by any member of the Group to the extent such Transaction
Security is required to be granted pursuant to the terms of the Secured Debt Documents, (I) of non-cash
interest made by way of capitalizing interest or issuing a non-cash-pay instrument which is subordinated to

payment is of a principal amount of the Second Lien Liabilities and made in accordance with a provision in
a Second Lien Finance Document relating to prepayment upon illegality or in relation to the prepayment of
a single lender in the event of a tax gross-up, increased costs or other indemnity becoming payable and (L) if
no Senior Secured Payment Default has occurred and is continuing the payment is a payment of principal,
interest or any other amounts made on or after the final maturity of the relevant Second Lien Liabilities
(provided that such maturity date is no earlier than that contained in the original form of the relevant Second
Lien Finance Document) as of the first date of borrowing or issuance (as the case may be) of the applicable
Second Lien Liabilities; or

(iii) if the requisite Senior Secured Creditors and Super Senior Creditors give prior consent to that payment being
made.

On or after the later of the Super Senior Discharge Date and the Senior Secured Discharge Date, the Debtors and the Third
Party Security Providers may make payments in respect of the Second Lien Liabilities in accordance with the Second Lien
Finance Documents.

_Second Lien Liabilities Payment Block Provisions_

A Second Lien Payment Stop Notice (as defined below) is outstanding from the date on which, following the occurrence of
certain material events of default, the Security Agent (acting on the instructions of the requisite Super Senior Creditors or
Senior Secured Creditors) issues a notice (a “Second Lien Payment Stop Notice”) to the Second Lien Creditor Representative(s)


-----

advising that the relevant event of default is continuing and suspending payments of the Second Lien Liabilities, until the first
to occur of:

(i) the date falling 120 days after delivery of that Second Lien Payment Stop Notice;

(ii) the date on which a default occurs for failure to pay principal at the original scheduled maturity of the relevant
Second Lien Liabilities;

(iii) if a Second Lien Standstill Period (as defined below) commences after delivery of that Second Lien Payment
Stop Notice, the date on which such standstill period expires;

(iv) the date on which the relevant material event of default has been remedied or waived;

(v) the date on which the Security Agent (acting on the instructions of whichever of the Super Senior Creditors
or Senior Secured Creditors gave the instructions for the relevant stop notice to be delivered) delivers a notice
to the Parent and the Second Lien Creditor Representative cancelling the payment stop notice;

(vi) the later of the Super Senior Discharge Date and the Senior Secured Discharge Date; and

(vii) the date on which the Second Lien Creditors take any enforcement action that is permitted under the
Intercreditor Agreement (see “—Permitted Second Lien Enforcement” below).

No Second Lien Payment Stop Notice may be delivered by the Security Agent in reliance on a particular relevant event of
default more than 45 days after the occurrence of the relevant event of default. No more than one Second Lien Payment Stop
Notice may be served (i) with respect to the same event or set of circumstances or (ii) in any period of 360 days.

Any failure to make a payment due in respect of the Second Lien Liabilities as a result of the issue of a Second Lien Payment
Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior Secured Payment Default shall not prevent (i) the occurrence of an event of default
as a consequence of that failure to make a payment in relation to the relevant Second Lien Liabilities or (ii) the issue of an
enforcement notice in respect of an event of default under the finance documents documenting any Second Lien Liabilities (a
“Second Lien Enforcement Notice”) on behalf of the Second Lien Creditors.

_Payment Obligations and Capitalization of Interest Continue_

Nothing in the Second Lien or Topco payment block provisions will release any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider from
the liability to make any payment (including of default interest, which shall continue to accrue) under the applicable Debt
Documents even if its obligation to make such payment is restricted at any time. The accrual and capitalization of interest (if
any) in accordance with the applicable Debt Documents shall continue notwithstanding the issue of a payment stop notice.

_Cure of Payment Stop_

If:

(i) at any time following the issue of a Second Lien Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior Secured
Payment Default that Second Lien Payment Stop Notice ceases to be outstanding and/or (as the case may be)
the Senior Secured Payment Default ceases to be continuing; and

(ii) the relevant Debtor then promptly pays to the Second Lien Creditors an amount equal to any payments which
had accrued under the Second Lien Finance Documents and which would have been Permitted Second Lien
Payments but for that Second Lien Payment Stop Notice or Senior Secured Payment Default (as the case may
be),

then any event of default which may have occurred under a Second Lien Finance Document and any Second Lien Enforcement
Notice which may have been issued as a result of that suspension of payments shall be deemed automatically waived without
any further action being required by the Second Lien Creditors.

_Permitted Payments in Respect of Topco Liabilities_

Prior to the first date on which all of the Senior Liabilities, the Super Senior Liabilities, the Senior Secured Notes Liabilities
and the Second Lien Liabilities (together, the “Secured Liabilities”) have been discharged (the “Priority Discharge Date”), the


-----

Debtors may only make specified scheduled payments in respect of the Topco Liabilities, in accordance with the finance
documents governing such Topco Liabilities, subject to compliance with certain conditions in the Intercreditor Agreement.

The principal conditions are that the relevant payment (if it is a payment of principal or capitalized interest) is not prohibited
by any prior ranking financing agreement, including any Permitted Super Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, Permitted
Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, any Senior Secured Notes Indenture, any Second Lien Facility Agreement and any
Second Lien Notes Indenture (or if it is so prohibited, that all necessary consents have been obtained to permit it), no payment
stop notice has been issued to the agent or trustee for the relevant Topco Liabilities and no payment default (subject to a de
_minimis threshold in the case of amounts other than principal, interest or certain fees) is continuing under any Permitted Senior_
Secured Facilities Agreement, Permitted Super Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, Cash Management Facility document,
Senior Secured Notes document or Second Lien Facility Agreement.

Certain specified payments in respect of Topco Liabilities are also permitted at all times, notwithstanding that a payment stop
notice is outstanding or such a payment default is continuing. These payments and basket amounts are substantially similar to
those referenced for Second Lien Liabilities in (ii) of “—Permitted Payments in Respect of Second Lien Liabilities” above.

**_Turnover_**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that if, at any time prior to the latest to occur of the Super
Senior Discharge Date, the Senior Secured Discharge Date, the first date on which all of the Second Lien Liabilities have been
fully discharged (the “Second Lien Discharge Date”) and the first date on which all of the Topco Liabilities have been fully
discharged (the “Topco Discharge Date”) (the “Final Discharge Date”) any creditor (other than a Senior Secured Creditor on
or after the Designation Date) receives or recovers from any Debtor, member of the Group or Third Party Security Provider:

(i) any payment or distribution of, or on account of or in relation to, any of the liabilities owed to the creditors
under the Debt Documents other than any payment or distribution which is either (x) not prohibited under
the Intercreditor Agreement or (y) made in accordance with the provisions set out below under “—
_Application of Proceeds”;_

(ii) any amount by way of set-off which does not give effect to a payment permitted under the Intercreditor
Agreement;

(iii) any amount:

(A) on account of, or in relation to, any of the liabilities owed to the creditors under the Debt Documents
(I) after the occurrence of an acceleration event or the enforcement of any Transaction Security as
a result of such an acceleration event, or (II) as a result of any other litigation or proceedings against
a Debtor, member of the Group or any Third Party Security Provider (other than after the occurrence
of an Insolvency Event (as defined below)); or

(B) by way of set-off in respect of any of the liabilities owed to it after the occurrence of an acceleration
event or the enforcement of any Transaction Security as a result of such an acceleration event;

(iv) the proceeds of any enforcement of any of the Transaction Security except in accordance with the provisions
set out below under “Application of Proceeds”; or

(v) any distribution in cash or in kind or payment of, or on account of or in relation to, any of the liabilities owed
by any Debtor, any member of the Group or Third Party Security Provider which is not in accordance with
the provisions set out below under “—Application of Proceeds” and which is made as a result of, or after,
the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in respect of that Debtor, member of the Group or Third Party Security
Provider,

that creditor will:

(i) in relation to receipts and recoveries not received or recovered by way of set-off (x) hold an amount of that
receipt or recovery equal to the relevant liabilities (or if less, the amount received or recovered) on trust for
(or otherwise on behalf and for the account of) the Security Agent and promptly pay or distribute that amount
to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, and
(y) promptly pay or distribute an amount equal to the amount (if any) by which the receipt or recovery


-----

exceeds the relevant liabilities to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement; and

(ii) in relation to receipts and recoveries received or recovered by way of set-off, promptly pay an amount equal
to that recovery to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement.

A turnover mechanism on substantially the same terms applies in the event that, at any time on or after the Designation Date
but prior to the Final Discharge Date, any Senior Secured Creditor receives or recovers from any Debtor, any member of the
Group or Third Party Security Provider (x) any proceeds from the enforcement of security or from a Distressed Disposal (as
defined below) or following an acceleration event or the enforcement of security, any proceeds arising from any of the charged
property or (y) any other amounts which should otherwise be received or recovered by the Security Agent except in accordance
with the provisions set out below under “—Application of Proceeds.”

**_Effect of Insolvency Event_**

“Insolvency Event” is defined as, in relation to any Obligor, Material Subsidiary (each as defined in the Senior Credit Facilities
Agreement) or Third Party Security Provider, (a) the passing of any resolution or making of an order for insolvency,
bankruptcy, winding up, dissolution, administration, examination or reorganization (excluding solvent reorganizations), (b) a
composition, compromise, assignment or arrangement with any class of creditors generally (other than any Secured Party), (c)
a moratorium is declared in relation to any of its indebtedness, (d) the appointment of a liquidator, receiver, examiner,
administrative receiver, administrator, compulsory manager or other similar officer in respect of it or any of its assets, or (e) any
analogous procedure or step is taken in any jurisdiction, other than (in each case), frivolous or vexatious proceedings,
proceedings or appointments which the Security Agent is satisfied will be withdrawn or unsuccessful or as permitted under any
Senior Credit Facility Agreement or in any Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, Permitted Super Senior Secured
Facilities Agreement or a Second Lien Facility Agreement, or otherwise not constituting a default.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event, any party entitled to receive a
distribution out of the assets of an Obligor, Material Subsidiary or Third Party Security Provider (in the case of a Senior Secured
Creditor on or after the Designation Date, only to the extent such amounts constitute proceeds of enforcement) shall direct the
person responsible for the distribution to pay that distribution to the Security Agent until the liabilities owing to the Secured
Parties have been paid in full. The Security Agent shall apply all such distributions paid to it in accordance with the provisions
set out under “—Application of _Proceeds” below._

To the extent that any member of the Group or Third Party Security Provider’s liabilities to creditors are, with certain
exceptions, discharged by way of set-off (mandatory or otherwise and in the case of a Senior Secured Creditor on or after the
Designation Date, only to the extent such amounts constitute proceeds of enforcement) after the occurrence of an Insolvency
Event, any creditor benefiting from such set-off shall pay an amount equal to the amount of the liabilities owed to it which are
discharged by that set-off to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the provisions set out under “—Application
_of Proceeds” below._

If the Security Agent or any other Secured Party receives a distribution in a form other than in cash in respect of any liabilities,
the liabilities will not be reduced by that distribution until and except to the extent that the realization proceeds are actually
applied towards such liabilities.

Subject to certain netting and set-off rights under ancillary or cash management facilities, each creditor irrevocably authorizes
the Security Agent to take Enforcement Action (as defined below), make demands, collect and receive distributions, file claims
and take other actions necessary to make recovery after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in relation to an Obligor, member
of the Group or Third Party Security Provider. The creditors agree to do all things the Security Agent reasonably requests in
order to give effect to these provisions.

**_Security Enforcement Regime_**

_Instructing Group_

An “Instructing Group” means:

(a) if the Designation Date has not occurred:

(i) prior to the Senior Secured Discharge Date, the Majority Senior Secured Creditors;


-----

(ii) on or after the Senior Secured Discharge Date but before the Priority Discharge Date, the Majority Second
Lien Creditors; and

(iii) on or after the Priority Discharge Date but before the Topco Discharge Date, the Majority Topco Creditors
(as defined below); and

(b) at any time on or after the occurrence of the Designation Date and:

(i) prior to the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the first date on which the Super Senior Liabilities
have been fully and finally discharged (the “Super Senior Discharge Date”), the Senior Secured Creditors
(other than the Super Senior Creditors) representing more than 50% of the Senior Secured Liabilities (other
than the Super Senior Liabilities) (the “Majority Senior Secured Creditors”), and Super Senior Creditors
representing more than 50% of the Super Senior Liabilities (the “Majority Super Senior Creditors”) save that,
for instructions relating to enforcement, it shall mean the group of Secured Creditors entitled to give
instructions in accordance with the enforcement regime described under “—Enforcement of Transaction
Security Prior to the Designation Date” and “—Enforcement of Transaction Security on or After the
Designation Date” below;

(ii) on or after the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the Super Senior Discharge Date but before
the Priority Discharge Date, the Second Lien Creditors representing more than 50% of the Second Lien
Liabilities (the “Majority Second Lien Creditors”); and

(iii) on or after the Priority Discharge Date but before the Topco Discharge Date, the Topco Creditors representing
more than 50% of the Topco Liabilities (the “Majority Topco Creditors”).

_Enforcement of Transaction Security Prior to the Designation Date_

Prior to the Designation Date, the Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security unless instructed
otherwise by (i) the Instructing Group, (ii) if, prior to the Senior Secured Discharge Date, the Instructing Group has (A) given
no instructions or has instructed the Security Agent neither to enforce or cease enforcing and (B) not required any Debtor or
Third Party Security Provider to make a Distressed Disposal (as defined below), an agent or trustee under the Second Lien
Liabilities (acting on the instructions of the Majority Second Lien Creditors) where the rights of the Second Lien Creditors to
enforce have arisen under the Intercreditor Agreement, or (iii) if, prior to the Priority Discharge Date, the Instructing Group (or
Majority Second Lien Creditors as applicable) have (A) given no instructions or have instructed the Security Agent neither to
enforce or cease enforcing and (B) not required any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to make a Distressed Disposal, a
Topco Agent or the Topco Notes Trustee (acting on the instructions of the Majority Topco Creditors).

Subject to the Transaction Security having become enforceable in accordance with its terms, the Instructing Group or any other
persons entitled to give instructions in accordance with the preceding paragraph may give or refrain from giving instructions
to the Security Agent to enforce, or refrain from enforcing, the Transaction Security as they see fit. Notwithstanding the above
paragraphs, if at any time the agents or representatives of the Second Lien Creditors or Topco Creditors then entitled to give
the Security Agent instructions to enforce the Transaction Security either gives such instruction or indicates any intention to
give such instruction, then the Instructing Group may give instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the Transaction Security
as the Instructing Group sees fit and the Security Agent shall act on such instructions received from the Instructing Group.

Unless (i) the Transaction Security has become enforceable as a result of an Insolvency Event or (ii) the Instructing Group or
any agent of the creditors represented in the Instructing Group determines in good faith that to do so could reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on the Security Agent’s ability to enforce the Transaction Security or the realization
proceeds of any such enforcement, before giving any such instructions to enforce the Transaction Security or take any other
enforcement action the creditors represented by an Instructing Group will be required to consult with each other agent (provided
that any agent in respect of Topco Liabilities need only be consulted if such enforcement relates to Topco Shared Security) for
a period of up to ten business days or take any Enforcement Action (the “Consultation Period”) and the Instructing Group will
only be entitled to give the enforcement instructions described above or take any Enforcement Action after the expiry of such
Consultation Period.

_Enforcement of Transaction Security on or After the Designation Date_

On or after the Designation Date, the Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security unless instructed
otherwise in accordance with the provisions described in this paragraph. If the Transaction Security has become enforceable,
if either the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors wish to issue enforcement instructions


-----

they shall deliver a copy of those instructions (an “Initial Enforcement Notice”) to the Security Agent and to the other agents,
trustees and hedge counterparties.

The Security Agent will act in accordance with any instructions (provided they are consistent with the Enforcement Principles
(as defined below)) received from (i) the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, (ii) if the Majority Senior Secured Creditors have
not made a determination as to the method of enforcement they wish to instruct the Security Agent to pursue within three
months of the Initial Enforcement Notice or the Super Senior Discharge Date has not occurred within six months of the Initial
Enforcement Notice, the Majority Super Senior Creditors, until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred, (iii) if an
Insolvency Event (other than an Insolvency Event directly caused by enforcement action taken at the request of a Super Senior
Creditor) is continuing, the Super Senior Creditors, until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred, (iv) if the Majority
Senior Secured Creditors have not made a determination as to the method of enforcement they wish to instruct the Security
Agent to pursue and the Majority Super Senior Creditors determine in good faith that a delay could reasonably be expected to
have a material adverse effect on the Security Agent’s ability to enforce the Transaction Security or on the realization of
proceeds and the Majority Super Senior Creditors deliver instructions before the Security Agent has received any instructions
from the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, the Majority Super Senior Creditors, until the Super Senior Discharge Date has
occurred, (v) if, prior to the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the Super Senior Discharge Date, the Majority
Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors (as applicable) have not given instructions or they have
instructed the Security Agent (A) not to enforce or cease enforcing or (B) required any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider
to make a Distressed Disposal, any agent or trustee in relation to the Second Lien Liabilities (the “Second Lien Agent”) (acting
on the instructions of the Majority Second Lien Creditors) where the rights of the Second Lien Creditors to enforce have arisen
under the Intercreditor Agreement, or (vi) if, prior to the Priority Discharge Date, the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the
Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Second Lien Creditors (as applicable) have not given instructions or they have
instructed the Security Agent (A) not to enforce or cease enforcing or (B) required any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider
to make a Distressed Disposal, an agent or trustee under the Topco Finance Documents (acting on the instructions of the
Majority Topco Creditors).

Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, if at any time the agents or representatives of the Second Lien Creditors or Topco
Creditors then entitled to give the Security Agent instructions either give such instruction or indicate any intention to give such
instruction, then the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or Majority Super Senior Creditors to the extent that such group is
entitled to give enforcement instructions as described in the paragraph above may give instructions to the Security Agent to
enforce the Transaction Security as they see fit and the Security Agent shall act on such instructions.

“Enforcement Principles” means certain requirements as to the manner of enforcement, including that (i) to the extent consistent
with a prompt and expeditious realization of value, the method of enforcement chosen should maximize the value realized from
such enforcement, (ii) certain proceeds must be received in cash, and (iii) enforcement in relation to assets over €5,000,000 or
shares if not carried out by way of a public auction or other competitive sales process, shall (if the Security Agent is request to
do so by the Majority Super Senior Creditors or Majority Senior Secured Creditors) benefit from a fairness opinion from an
investment bank, firm of accountants or third-party financial adviser which is regularly engaged in issuing such opinions.

_Enforcement—Topco Independent Transaction Security_

Subject to the Topco Independent Transaction Security having become enforceable in accordance with its terms, an agent or
trustee under the Topco Finance Documents (acting on the instructions of the Majority Topco Creditors) may give or refrain
giving, instructions to the Security Agent to enforce or refrain from enforcing the Topco Independent Transaction Security as
they see fit.

_Manner of Enforcement_

If the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security is being enforced in accordance with any of the above
paragraphs, the Security Agent shall enforce the relevant Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security in
such manner (including, without limitation, the selection of any administrator of any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider
to be appointed by the Security Agent) as any persons entitled at any time under the above provisions shall instruct it or, in the
absence of any such instructions, as the Security Agent sees fit (which may include taking no action).

No Secured Party shall have any independent power to enforce, or to have recourse to enforce, any Transaction Security or
Topco Independent Transaction Security or to exercise any rights or powers arising under the security documents except
through the Security Agent.


-----

_Security Held by Other Creditors_

If any Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security is held by a creditor other than the Security Agent, then
creditors may only enforce that Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security in accordance with
instructions given by instructing creditors in accordance with the paragraphs above.

**_Enforcement Regime_**

_Restrictions on Enforcement by Second Lien Creditors_

Until the later of the Super Senior Discharge Date and the Senior Secured Discharge Date, except with the prior consent of or
as required by an Instructing Group, no Second Lien Creditor shall take or require the taking of any Enforcement Action against
a member of the Group or Third Party Security Provider in relation to the Second Lien Liabilities except as set out under “—
_Permitted Second Lien Enforcement” provided that no such action required by an Instructing Group need by taken except to_

offers or exchange offers not undertaken as part of an announced restructuring or turnaround plan or while a
default was outstanding under the relevant finance documents); or

(v) petitioning, applying, voting for or taking steps (including the appointment of any liquidator, receiver,
administrator or similar officer) in relation to the winding up, dissolution, administration or reorganization

security or guarantees in respect of liabilities owed to a creditor under the Intercreditor Agreement or any of
such Third Party Security Provider or member of the Topco Group’s assets or any suspension of payments

diluted and any relevant shares remain subject to the same Transaction Security as existed prior to the issue, and (F) proceedings
brought by an ancillary lender, a lender of Cash Management Facility Liabilities (a “Cash Management Facility Lender”),
hedge counterparty, issuing bank, or agent or trustee in respect of the Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Liabilities to obtain

-----

Document to which it is party with no claim for damages or in connection with any securities violation, securities or listing
regulations or common law fraud.

_Permitted Second Lien Enforcement_

The restrictions set out above under “—Restrictions on Enforcement by Second Lien Creditors” will not apply in respect of any
of the Second Lien Liabilities owed to it if at the same time as, or prior to, that action:

(i) a Super Senior Acceleration Event or a Senior Acceleration Event or a Senior Secured Notes Acceleration
Event has occurred in which case each Second Lien Creditor may take the same Enforcement Action (but in
respect of the Second Lien Liabilities) as constitutes that Super Senior Acceleration Event or Senior
Acceleration Event or Senior Secured Notes Acceleration Event;

(ii) a Second Lien Creditor Representative has given notice (a “Second Lien Enforcement Notice”) to the
Security Agent specifying that a second lien event of default (save and except arising pursuant to a breach of
any provisions in the relevant Second Lien Facility Agreement relating to cross default (including to the
Senior Credit Facilities Agreement or any Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement or Permitted Super
Senior Secured Facilities Agreement)) under the Second Lien Finance Documents in respect of which it is
an agent has occurred and is continuing and:

(A) a period (a “Second Lien Standstill Period”) of not less than:

(1) 90 days in the case of a failure to make a payment of an amount of principal, interest or
fees representing the Second Lien Liabilities; or

(2) 120 days in the case of an event of default under any financial maintenance covenant in
any Second Lien Facility Agreement substantially equivalent to the Financial Covenant of
the Senior Secured Credit Agreement; and

(3) 150 days in the case of any other second lien event of default,

or, in relation to any Second Lien Liabilities, such longer period (if any) as agreed between the
Company (in its discretion) and the Second Lien Creditor Representative in relation to such Second
Lien Liabilities and notified to the Security Agent in each case which has elapsed from the date on
which that Second Lien Enforcement Notice becomes effective in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement; and

(B) that second lien event of default is continuing at the end of the Second Lien Standstill Period; or

(iii) at the same time as or prior to that action the consent of the Majority Senior Secured Creditors and Majority
Super Senior Creditors for that Enforcement Action is obtained.

To the extent permitted under applicable law, after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event, each Second Lien Creditor may
(unless otherwise directed by the Security Agent or unless the Security Agent has taken, or has given notice that it intends to
take, action on behalf of that Second Lien Creditor) exercise any right they may otherwise have against that Obligor, Material
Subsidiary or Third Party Security Provider to:

(i) accelerate any of that Obligor’s or, as the case may be, Third Party Security Provider’s or Material
Subsidiary’s Second Lien Liabilities or declare them prematurely due and payable or payable on demand;

the case may be, Third Party Security Provider or Material Subsidiary in respect of any Second Lien
Liabilities;

of that Obligor or, as the case may be, Third Party Security Provider or Material Subsidiary; or

case may be, Third Party Security Provider or Material Subsidiary for the Second Lien Liabilities owing to
it.


-----

_Option to Purchase: Second Lien Creditors_

Following acceleration or the enforcement of Transaction Security upon acceleration under any Senior Secured Creditor
Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Liabilities, Second Lien Creditors may elect to purchase the Senior Lender
Liabilities, Super Senior Lender Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes Liabilities and the Cash Management Facility Liabilities for
the amount that would have been required to prepay or redeem such liabilities on such date plus certain costs and expenses.
Second Lien Creditors must also elect for the counterparties to hedging obligations to transfer their hedging obligations to
holders in exchange (subject to specified conditions) for the amount that would have been payable under such hedging
obligations had they been terminated on such date plus certain costs and expenses in connection with any such purchase.

_Restrictions on Enforcement by Topco Creditors_

Certain of the features set out above with respect to Second Lien Creditors apply to the Topco Creditors, with appropriate
modifications for the relative position in the capital structure.

**Non-Distressed Disposals**

The Security Agent (on behalf of itself and the other Secured Parties) and each other person party to a document evidencing
the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security agrees that it shall (and is irrevocably authorized,
instructed and obliged to do so without further consent, agreement or instruction from any creditor, other Secured Party or
Debtor) promptly following receipt of a written request from the Parent:

(i) release (or procure the release) from the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security:

(A) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any asset which the Parent has
confirmed is the subject of:

(1) a disposal not prohibited under the Finance Documents or where any applicable release
and/ or consent has been obtained under the applicable Finance Document including a
disposal to a member of the Group but without prejudice to any obligation of any member
of the Group in a Finance Document to provide replacement security; or

(2) any other transaction not prohibited by the Finance Documents pursuant to which that asset
will cease to be held or owned by a member of the Group; and

in each case where such disposal is not a Distressed Disposal (as defined below) (in each case, a “NonDistressed Disposal”);

(B) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any document or other agreement
requested in order for any member of the Group to effect any amendment or waiver or otherwise
exercise any rights, comply with any obligation or take any action in relation to such document or
agreement (to the extent that the Parent has confirmed that such action is not prohibited by any
Finance Document);

(C) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any asset of any member of the
Group which has ceased or will cease to be a Debtor or guarantor to the extent that the Parent has
confirmed that such ceasing to be a Debtor or guarantor in accordance with the terms of each Finance
Document or the Agreed Security Principles (as defined in the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement);
and

(D) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any other asset to the extent that
the Parent has confirmed that such security is not required to be given or such release in accordance
with the terms of any Finance Document or the Agreed Security Principles (as defined in the Senior
Credit Facilities Agreement); and

(ii) in the case of a disposal of share or ownership interest in a Debtor, other member of the Group or any holding
company of any Debtor or any other transaction pursuant to which a Debtor, other member of the Group or
any holding company of any Debtor will cease to be a member of the Topco Group or a Debtor, release or
procure the release of that Debtor or other member of the Group and its subsidiaries from all present and
future liabilities under the Secured Debt Documents and the respective assets of such Debtor and its


-----

subsidiaries from the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security and the Secured Debt
Documents (including any claim relating to a Debt Document).

When making any request for a release pursuant to paragraphs (i)(A) or (i)(B) above, the Parent shall confirm in writing to the
Security Agent, that the relevant disposal or other action is not prohibited as at the date of completion of such release or, at the
option of the Parent, on the date that the definitive agreement for such disposal or similar transaction is entered into.

When making any request for a release pursuant to paragraph (i)(C) or (i)(D) above, the Parent shall confirm in writing to the
Security Agent, that such security is not required to be given or the relevant release or cessation is otherwise in accordance
with the terms of the Finance Documents or the Agreed Security Principles (as defined in the Senior Credit Facilities
Agreement).

In the case of a disposal of shares or other ownership interests in a Debtor, member of the Group or holding company of any
Debtor or any other transaction pursuant to which a Debtor, member of the Group or holding company of any Debtor will cease
to be a member of Topco Group or a Debtor, to the extent the Parent has confirmed to the Security Agent that it is not prohibited
by the Finance Documents, if such member of the Topco Group or a Debtor is a borrower, issuer or primary debtor under any
Debt Document, such person shall have the right to voluntarily prepay all Liabilities outstanding under any Debt Document.

**_Distressed Disposals_**

“Distressed Disposal” means a disposal of an asset or shares of, or other financial securities issued by a member of the Group
or, in the case of a Third Party Security Provider, any assets or shares or financial securities which are subject to the Transaction
Security which is being effected (a) at the request of an Instructing Group in circumstances where the Transaction Security has
become enforceable as a result of an acceleration event, (b) by enforcement of the Transaction Security as a result of an
acceleration event, or (c) after the occurrence of an acceleration event or the enforcement of security as a result of an
acceleration event, by a Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to a person or persons which is not a member of the Group.

If a Distressed Disposal of any asset is being effected, the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized (at the cost of the relevant
Debtor, Third Party Security Provider and the Parent and without any consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from
any creditor under the Intercreditor Agreement, Third Party Security Provider or Debtor):

(i) to release the Transaction Security or any other claim over that asset, enter into any release of that Transaction
Security or claim and issue any letters of non-crystallization of any floating charge or any consent to dealing
that may, in the discretion of the Security Agent, be necessary or desirable;

(ii) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor to release:

(A) that Debtor and any subsidiary of that Debtor from all or any part of its borrowing, guarantee or
other liabilities;

(B) any Transaction Security granted by that Debtor or any subsidiary of that Debtor over any of its
assets; and

(C) any other claim of an intra-group lender, a Topco Investor, Subordinated Creditor or another Debtor
over that Debtor’s assets or over the assets of any subsidiary of that Debtor, on behalf of the relevant
creditors and Debtors;

(iii) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of any holding company of a Debtor to release
(A) that holding company and any subsidiary of that holding company from all or any part of its borrowing,
guarantee or other liabilities; (B) any Transaction Security granted by that holding company or any subsidiary
of that holding company over any of its assets, and (C) any other claim of an intra-group lender, a Topco
Investor, Subordinated Creditor or another Debtor over that holding company’s assets or over the assets of
any subsidiary of that Debtor, on behalf of the relevant creditors and Debtors;

(iv) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding company of a
Debtor and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) decides to dispose of
all or any part of the liabilities owed by such Debtor or holding company or any of their subsidiaries to
creditors or other Debtors:


-----

(A) if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does not intend that
any transferee of those liabilities (the “Transferee”) will be treated as a Secured Party for the
purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement, to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to
dispose of all or part of those liabilities, provided that, notwithstanding any other provision of any
Debt Document, the Transferee shall not be treated as a Secured Creditor or Secured Party for the
purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement; and

(B) if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does intend that any
Transferee will be treated as a Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement, to
execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to dispose of all (and not part only) of the liabilities
owed to the Secured Parties and all or part of any other liabilities,

on behalf of, in each case, the relevant creditors, Third Party Security Providers and Debtors;

(v) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding company of a
Debtor (the “Disposed Entity”) and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement) decides to transfer to another Debtor (the “Receiving Entity”) all or any part of the Disposed
Entity’s obligations or any obligations of a subsidiary of that Disposed Entity in respect of the intra-group
liabilities or liabilities owed to any Debtor, to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to:

(A) transfer all or part of the obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities or liabilities to any
Debtor on behalf of the relevant intra-group lenders and Debtors to which those obligations are
owed and on behalf of the Debtors which owe those obligations; and

(B) (provided the Receiving Entity is a holding company of the Disposed Entity which is also a
Guarantor of the Senior Secured Liabilities, the Second Lien Liabilities or the Topco Liabilities) to
accept the transfer of all or part of the obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities, liabilities
owed to Debtors on behalf of the Receiving Entity or Receiving Entities to which the obligations in
respect of those intra-group liabilities or liabilities owed to Debtors are to be transferred.

The net proceeds of each Distressed Disposal (and the net proceeds of any disposal of liabilities as described above) shall be
paid to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the provisions set out under “—Application of Proceeds” below
as if those proceeds were the proceeds of an enforcement of the Transaction Security and, to the extent that any disposal of
liabilities has occurred, as if that disposal of liabilities had not occurred.

In the case of a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities) effected by, or at the request of, the Security Agent, the Security
Agent shall take reasonable care to obtain a fair market price in the prevailing market conditions (although the Security Agent
shall not have any obligation to postpone any such Distressed Disposal or disposal of liabilities in order to achieve a higher
price).

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the Majority Second Lien Creditors are entitled to give and have given
instructions in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent is not authorized to release any Debtor,
subsidiary or holding company from any borrowing liabilities or guarantee liabilities owed to any Senior Secured Creditor
unless those borrowing liabilities or guarantee liabilities and any other Senior Secured Liabilities will be paid (or repaid) in full
(or, in the case of any contingent liability relating to a letter of credit, cash management facility or an ancillary facility, made
the subject of cash collateral arrangements acceptable to the relevant senior creditor) following that release.

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the Majority Topco Creditors are entitled to give, and have given
instructions in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent is not authorized to release any Debtor,
subsidiary or holding company from any borrowing liabilities or guarantee liabilities owed to any Senior Secured Creditor or
any Second Lien Creditor unless those borrowing liabilities or guarantee liabilities and any other Senior Secured Liabilities or
Second Lien Liabilities will be paid (or repaid) in full (or, in the case of any contingent liability relating to a letter of credit,
cash management facility or an ancillary facility, made the subject of cash collateral arrangements acceptable to the relevant
senior creditor) following that release.

Where borrowing liabilities in respect of any Senior Secured Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes
Proceeds Loan Liabilities, Topco Liabilities or unsecured liabilities would otherwise be released pursuant to the Intercreditor
Agreement, the creditor concerned may elect to have those borrowing liabilities transferred to a holding company of the Parent,
in which case the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized (at the cost of the relevant Debtor or the Parent and without any


-----

consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any creditor or Debtor) to execute such documents as are required to
so transfer those borrowing liabilities.

If before the Second Lien Discharge Date or the Topco Discharge Date, a Distressed Disposal is being effected such that the
Second Lien Liabilities or the Topco Liabilities and Transaction Security over shares in a borrower or issuer of, or over assets
of a borrower or issuer of, Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Liabilities will be released pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement,
it is a further condition to the release that either:

(i) the Second Lien Agent, second lien notes trustee, Topco Agent and Topco Notes Trustee (as applicable) have
approved the release; or

(ii) where shares or assets of a borrower, issuer or guarantor in respect of Second Lien Liabilities or Topco
Guarantor are sold:

(A) the proceeds of such sale or disposal are in cash (or substantially in cash) and/or other marketable
securities or, if the proceeds of such sale or disposal are not in cash (or substantially in cash) and/
or other marketable securities, a valuation opinion has been obtained in accordance with the
provisions set out below; and

(B) all claims of the Secured Creditors (other than in relation to performance bonds, guarantees or
similar instruments issued by a Secured Creditor on behalf of a member of the Group) against a
member of the Group (if any), all of whose shares (other than any minority interest not owned by
members of the Group) are pledged in favor of the Priority Secured Parties are sold or disposed of
pursuant to such Enforcement Action, are unconditionally released and discharged or sold or
disposed of concurrently with such sale (and are not assumed by the purchaser or one of its
affiliates), and all Transaction Security, Topco Independent Transaction Security or other security
in favor of the Secured Parties in respect of the assets that are sold or disposed of is simultaneously
and unconditionally released and discharged concurrently with such sale, provided that in the event
of a sale or disposal of any such claim (instead of a release or discharge):

(1) where the Senior Secured Creditors constitute the Instructing Group, the Senior Agent and
any senior secured notes trustee (i) determine, acting reasonably and in good faith, that the
Senior Secured Creditors will recover more than if such claim was released or discharged
but nevertheless less than the outstanding Senior Secured Liabilities, and (ii) serve a notice
on the Security Agent notifying the Security Agent of the same;

(2) where the Second Lien Creditors constitute the Instructing Group, the Second Lien Agent
and any second lien notes trustee (i) determine acting reasonably and in good faith that the
Priority Secured Parties (collectively) will recover more than if such claim was released or
discharged but nevertheless less than the outstanding amount of the liabilities owed to the
Priority Secured Parties (the “Priority Secured Liabilities”), and (ii) serve a notice on the
Security Agent notifying the Security Agent of the same; and

(3) where the Topco Creditors constitute the Instructing Group, the Topco Agent and the
Topco Notes Trustee (i) determine acting reasonably and in good faith that the Priority
Secured Parties and the Topco Creditors (collectively) will recover more than if such claim
was released or discharged but is nevertheless less than the outstanding Priority Secured
Liabilities and the Topco Liabilities (collectively), and serve a notice on the Security Agent
notifying the Security Agent of the same;

in which case the Security Agent shall be entitled immediately to sell and transfer such claim to such
purchaser (or an affiliate of such purchaser) and the consideration for such sale or transfer may be in the form
of non-cash consideration by way of the Senior Secured Creditors, Second Lien Creditors or Topco Creditors
(whichever constitutes the Instructing Group) bidding by an appropriate mechanic the Senior Secured
Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Liabilities (as applicable) such that the relevant liabilities would
on completion be discharged to the extent of an amount equal to the amount of the offer made by the relevant
creditors; and

(C) such sale or disposal (including any sale or disposal of any claim) is made:


-----

(1) pursuant to a public auction or other competitive sale process run in accordance with the
advice of a reputable, independent investment bank, firm of accountants or third-party
professional firm with a view to obtaining the best price reasonably obtainable taking into
account all relevant circumstances and in which creditors under the Second Lien Liabilities
and Topco Liabilities are entitled to participate as prospective buyers and/or financiers; or

(2) where a reputable, independent investment bank, firm of accountants or third-party
professional firm which is regularly engaged in providing such valuations has delivered an
opinion (including an enterprise valuation which can be relied upon by the Security Agent
and disclosed to the Senior Secured Creditors, the Second Lien Creditors and the Topco
Creditors) in respect of such sale or disposal that the amount is fair from a financial point
of view, taking into account all relevant circumstances including the method of
enforcement, provided that the liability of such investment bank, firm of accountants or
third-party professional firm in giving such opinion may be limited to the amount of its
fees in respect of such engagement.

**_Application of Proceeds_**

in priority to any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider; and

(v) the balance, if any, in payment to the relevant Debtor.

**_Equalization_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that if, for any reason, any liabilities relating to Super Senior Liabilities, Senior Secured
Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Liabilities remain unpaid after the first date on which certain types of Enforcement
Action are taken (the “Enforcement Date”) and the resulting losses are not borne by the creditors in any given specified class
in the proportions which their respective exposures at the Enforcement Date bore to the aggregate exposures of all the creditors
in that specified class at the Enforcement Date, the relevant class of creditors will make such payments amongst themselves as
the Security Agent shall require to put the relevant creditors in such a position that (after taking into account such payments)
those losses are borne in those proportions. The enforceability of these equalization provisions is uncertain.

**_Required Consents_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, subject to certain exceptions, its terms may be amended or waived only with the
consent of the Parent, the agents and trustees for the Secured Parties, and the Security Agent, provided that, to the extent that
an amendment, waiver or consent only affects one class of creditors, and such amendment, waiver or consent could not
reasonably be expected materially or adversely to affect the interests of the other classes of creditors, only written agreement
from the agent or trustee acting on behalf of the affected class (or, in the case of Hedge Counterparties, each affected Hedge
Counterparty) shall be required.

An amendment or waiver of the Intercreditor Agreement that has the effect of changing or which relates to, among other
matters, the provisions set out under “—Application of Proceeds” above and the order of priority or subordination under the
Intercreditor Agreement shall not be made without the consent of each of the agents or trustees (acting in accordance with the
relevant finance documents) under the Senior Liabilities, the Super Senior Liabilities, the Second Lien Liabilities and the Topco
Liabilities, each Cash Management Facility Lender (only to the extent that the proposed amendment or waiver would materially
adversely affect the rights and obligations of such Cash Management Facility Lender under the Intercreditor Agreement and
would not materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of any other creditor or class of creditors), each Hedge
Counterparty (only to the extent that the proposed amendment or waiver would materially adversely affect the rights and
obligations of such Hedge Counterparty under the Intercreditor Agreement and would not materially adversely affect the rights
and obligations of any other creditor or class of creditors), and the Parent.

Each agent or trustee shall, to the extent instructed to consent by the requisite percentage of creditors it represents or as
otherwise authorized by the Debt Documents to which it is party, act on such instructions or authorizations in accordance
therewith (save to the extent any amendments so consented or authorized to relate to any provision affecting the personal rights
and obligations of that agent or trustee in its capacity as such).

_Amendments and Waivers: Transaction Security Documents_

Subject to certain exceptions under the Intercreditor Agreement (as described below), the Security Agent may, if the Parent
consents, amend the terms of, release or waive any of the requirements of or grant consents under, any document creating
Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security which shall be binding on each party and any amendment,
release or waiver of, or consent under, any document creating Transaction Security which would adversely affect the nature or
scope of the assets subject to Transaction Security or the manner in which the proceeds of enforcement of the Transaction
Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security are distributed, shall not be made without the consent of:

(i) each of the Agents (other than the agent in respect of any Cash Management Facility) acting in accordance
with the provisions of the applicable Finance Documents;

(ii) each Cash Management Facility Lender (or the relevant Cash Management Facility Agent on its behalf, if
appointed) but only to the extent that such amendment or waiver would (i) materially adversely affect the
rights and obligations of the Cash Management Facility lenders under the Intercreditor Agreement in their


-----

capacity as such, and (ii) would not materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of any Creditor or
class of Creditors other than the Cash Management Facility lenders (solely in their capacity as such);

(iii) each Hedge Counterparty but only to the extent that such amendment or waiver would materially adversely
affect the rights and obligations of the Hedge Counterparties under the Intercreditor Agreement in their
capacity as such, and would not materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of any Creditor or class
of Creditors other than the Hedge Counterparties (solely in their capacity as such); and

(iv) the Parent.

_Exceptions_

Subject to the paragraph below, an amendment, waiver or consent which relates to the rights or obligations which are personal
to an agent, an arranger or the Security Agent in its capacity as such (including, without limitation, any ability of that Security
Agent to act in its discretion under the Intercreditor Agreement) may not be effected without the consent of that agent, arranger
or, as the case may be, Security Agent.

The preceding paragraph and the first paragraph above under “—Amendments and Waivers: Transaction Security Documents”
are subject to certain exceptions under the Intercreditor Agreement, relating in particular to (i) any release of Transaction
Security, claim or liabilities, or (ii) to any amendment waiver or consent, which, in each case, the Security Agent gives in
accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement relating to the incurrence of additional or refinancing debt or
the provisions set out under “—New Debt Financing.”

“Non-Distressed Disposals” and “—Distressed Disposals” above. Any release, amendment, waiver or consent effected in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Debt Documents relating to such matters can be effected solely by the Parent
and the Security Agent.

_Snooze/Lose_

If in relation to a request for a consent, to participate in a vote of a class of creditors, to approve any action or to provide any
confirmation or notification, in each case, under the Intercreditor Agreement or any other Debt Document which does not
contain a snooze/lose provision substantially similar to that contained in the Intercreditor Agreement, any creditor fails to
respond to the request within ten business days (or any other period of time notified by the Parent, with the agreement of each
of the agents or trustee in the case of a shorter period of time) of that request being made or fails to provide details of its credit
participation, such creditor will be disregarded or be deemed to have zero participation in respect of the matter or be deemed
to have provided the relevant confirmation or notification, as applicable, provided that the Snooze/Lose shall not apply to any
noteholder in respect of any request where such noteholder is not given the option to respond to such request in the negative,
but shall otherwise apply to all noteholders.

_Provisions Following an IPO_

Following an initial public offering of a member of the Group (or a holding company thereof) (an “IPO”), the Parent is entitled
to give notice that the terms of the Debt Documents will automatically operate so that, amongst other things, (i) the Group (and
all related provisions) will now refer to the member of the Group or holding company of the Parent who will issue shares or
whose shares are to be sold pursuant to such IPO (the “IPO Pushdown Entity,” and if any Topco Notes are not refinanced in
full on or before the date of such IPO, the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be any holding company of the Parent which is the issuer
or borrower of any Topco Liabilities) and its Restricted Subsidiaries, (ii) all financial ratio calculations shall be made excluding
any holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity, and (iii) certain provisions of the Debt Documents (including
representations, undertakings and events of default) will cease to apply to any holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity.

Each holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be released from all obligations under the Debt Documents (including
any Transaction Security) and each Subordinated Creditor, Third Party Security Provider, Investor (as defined in the Senior
Credit Facilities Agreement) or Topco Independent Obligor will be released from its obligations and restrictions under the
Intercreditor Agreement in the appropriate capacity.

Subject to the consent of the majority lenders under and as defined in the Senior Lender Liabilities, noteholders representing
more than 50% of any Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, the majority lenders under and as defined in any Second Lien Facility
Agreement, noteholders representing more than 50% of any Second Lien Notes Liabilities, the majority lenders under and as
defined in any Topco Facility and noteholders representing more than 50% of any Topco Notes Liabilities (following the
relevant IPO), each subsidiary of the IPO Pushdown Entity shall also be released from all obligations as Debtor and guarantor


-----

under the Debt Documents and from the Transaction Security (other than, in each case, borrowing liabilities). Each party to the
Intercreditor Agreement shall be required to enter into any amendment, release or replacement of any Debt Document required
to facilitate such matters.

_Agreement to Override_

Unless expressly stated otherwise therein, the Intercreditor Agreement overrides anything in any other Debt Documents to the
contrary (other than (a) any Transaction Security documents which are governed by German law and need to be notarized
(beurkundet) and (b) any provisions of mandatory Dutch law in respect of the Transaction Security Documents governed by
the laws of the Netherlands).

**The U.S. Sale and Leaseback Transaction**

On May 16, 2023, we completed the sale and leaseback of a portfolio of 414 sites across Cumberland Farms, Fastrac, Tom
Thumb and Sprint banners in the United States (the “U.S. Sale and Leaseback”) for a gross consideration of $1.5 billion. In
July 2023, as described below in “Summary—Recent Developments—Senior Credit Facilities Prepayment and Existing Notes
_Redemption,” we used a portion of these proceeds to partially redeem our Existing Notes and repay a portion of our Senior_
Credit Facilities. We intend to use the remaining net proceeds from the U.S. Sale and Leaseback, along with the proceeds from
the Non-Core Minit Mart Disposal (Missouri and Kansas) and the UK Disposal to Asda, to repay a portion of the Tranche A
Term Facilities (as defined herein) and Tranche B Term Facilities (as defined herein), as described in “Summary—Recent
_Developments—Senior Credit Facilities Amend and Extend” and to redeem a portion of our Existing Notes. See_
“Capitalization”.

For a description of the key terms of the U.S. Sale and Leaseback, see “The Transactions—Sale and Leaseback Transaction”.


-----

**DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES**

The following is a description of the €        million aggregate principal amount of       % Senior Secured Notes due
2028 (the “Euro Notes”) and the $       million aggregate principal amount of        % Senior Secured Notes due 2028
(the “Dollar Notes” and together with the Euro Notes, the “Notes”). The Notes will be issued by EG Global Finance plc (the
“Issuer”). You will find definitions of certain capitalized terms used in this “Description of the Notes” under the heading
“Certain Definitions.” For purposes of this “Description of the Notes,” (i) references to the “Parent” refer only to EG Group
Limited and not to any of its subsidiaries, (ii) references to the “Issuer” refer only to EG Global Finance plc, and (iii) references
to “we,” “our,” “us” or “Group” refer to the Parent and the Parent’s Restricted Subsidiaries, including the Issuer.

The Issuer will issue the Notes under an indenture to be dated as of the Issue Date (the “Indenture”), between, inter alios, the
Issuer, the Parent, Deutsche Trustee Company Limited, as trustee (in such capacity, the “Trustee”), Deutsche Bank AG, London
Branch, as paying agent and transfer agent with respect to the Euro Notes, Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as paying
agent and transfer with respect to the Dollar Notes, Barclays Bank PLC, as security agent (in such capacity, the “Security
Agent”), and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as registrar, in a private transaction that is not subject to the registration
requirements of the Securities Act. The Indenture will not be qualified under, incorporate by reference or include, or be subject
to, any of the provisions of the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, including Section 316(b) of such Act.
Consequently, the Holders will not be entitled to the protections provided under the Trust Indenture Act to holders of debt
securities issued under a qualified indenture, including among other things, those requiring the Trustee to resign in the event
of certain conflicts of interest and to inform Holders of certain relationships between it and us.

On or about the Issue Date, the Issuer will use the gross proceeds from the Offering and the Tranche E Term Facilities to (i)
redeem the Existing Notes and (ii) pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Offering Transactions.

The Indenture will be unlimited in aggregate principal amount. We may, subject to applicable law and the terms of the
Indenture, issue an unlimited principal amount of additional Euro Notes (the “Additional Euro Notes”) and additional Dollar
Notes (the “Additional Dollar Notes” and together with the Additional Euro Notes, the “Additional Notes”); provided that if
the Additional Euro Notes are not fungible (for U.S. federal income tax purposes) with the Euro Notes originally issued or the
Additional Dollar Notes are not fungible (for U.S. federal income tax purposes) with the Dollar Notes originally issued,
respectively, such Additional Euro Notes or Additional Dollar Notes, as applicable, will be issued with a separate ISIN code
or common code or other identifying number, as applicable, from the Euro Notes or Dollar Notes, as applicable, originally
issued.

We will only be permitted to issue Additional Notes in compliance with the covenants contained in the Indenture, including
the covenants restricting the Incurrence of Indebtedness and the Incurrence of Liens. See “—Certain Covenants—Limitation
_on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens.” Except as otherwise provided for in the Indenture, the Euro_
Notes (together with any Additional Euro Notes) and the Dollar Notes (together with any Additional Dollar Notes) will
constitute a separate series of Notes, but shall be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture, including in
respect of any amendment, waiver or other modification of the Indenture, redemption and offers to purchase or any other action
by the Holders thereunder. Unless the context otherwise requires, in this “Description of the Notes,” references to the “Notes”
include the Euro Notes and the Dollar Notes and any Additional Euro Notes and Additional Dollar Notes that are actually
issued under the Indenture.

The Indenture will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreements (as
defined below), and in the case of certain conflicts between the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement will prevail. The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to understanding the
relative ranking of indebtedness and security, the ability to make payments in respect of the indebtedness, the procedures for
undertaking enforcement action, the subordination of certain indebtedness, turnover obligations, release of security and
guarantees, and the payment waterfall for amounts received by the Security Agent. See “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” for a description of certain terms of the Intercreditor Agreement._

This “Description of the Notes” is intended to be an overview of the material provisions of the Notes and the Indenture and
refers to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents. Since this description of the terms of the Notes is only a
summary, you should refer to the Notes, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents for complete
descriptions of the obligations of the Issuer and your rights. Copies of such documents will be available as set forth under
“Listing and General Information.”

The registered Holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered Holders will have rights
under the Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to enforcement and the pursuit of other remedies. The Notes
have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act and will be subject to certain transfer restrictions.


-----

**General**

**_The Notes_**

The Notes will:

- be general senior obligations of the Issuer, secured as set forth under “—Security”;

- rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer that is not subordinated in right
of payment to the Notes, including the obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, the Existing Notes, the
Second Lien Credit Facilities Agreement, certain Hedging Obligations, if any, and certain other future senior indebtedness
permitted to be incurred under the Indenture;

- rank senior in right of payment to all of the Issuer’s existing and future debt that is expressly subordinated in right of
payment to the Notes;

- be guaranteed on or around the Issue Date by the Guarantors on a senior basis and subject to the Agreed Security Principles,
as described below under “—Notes Guarantees;”

- be effectively senior to any existing or future indebtedness or obligation of the Issuer that is secured on the Collateral on
a junior basis to the Notes, including the Second Lien Credit Facilities, or that is not secured by the Collateral owned by
the Issuer, in each case, to the extent of the value of such Collateral that is available to satisfy the obligations under the
Notes;

- be effectively subordinated to any existing and future indebtedness or obligation of the Issuer that is secured by property
or assets that do not constitute Collateral, to the extent of the value of the property or assets securing such obligation or
indebtedness;

- be structurally subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness of Subsidiaries of the Parent (including obligations to
trade creditors) that do not guarantee the Notes; and

- be represented by one or more registered Notes in global form, but in certain circumstances may be represented by
Definitive Registered Notes (as defined herein). See “Book-Entry; Delivery and Form.”

The Notes will mature on        , 2028, subject to adjustment as described under “—Principal, Maturity and Interest.”

Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Holders will receive proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral (as
defined below) on a pari passu basis with all indebtedness that is secured on an equal and ratable basis with the Notes, including
obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, the Existing Notes and certain Hedging Obligations, and in priority
to any indebtedness that is secured on a junior basis to the Notes, including obligations under the Second Lien Credit Facilities
Agreement; provided, however, that under certain circumstances, certain Indebtedness and Hedging Obligations may be redesignated as “super senior” obligations under the Intercreditor Agreement, and following such re-designation, Holders will
only receive proceeds from the Collateral after such super senior obligations have been paid in full. See “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements —Intercreditor Agreement” and “—Certain Definitions—Permitted Collateral Liens.”_

The Issuer is a finance subsidiary of the Parent. The Issuer does not directly engage in any material business operations and
has limited assets. Accordingly, the Issuer will depend on the receipt of funds from the other Subsidiaries of the Parent to meet
its obligations, including its obligations under the Notes and the Existing Notes. The Notes will be structurally subordinated in
right of payments to all Indebtedness and other liabilities and commitments (including trade payables and lease obligations) of
the Parent’s Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors.

As of the Issue Date, all of the Parent’s Subsidiaries will be “Restricted Subsidiaries” for purposes of the Indenture. However,
under the circumstances described below under “—Certain Covenants—Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted
_Subsidiaries” and consistent with the definition set forth under “—Certain Definitions—Unrestricted Subsidiary,” we will be_
permitted to designate certain of our Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries. Our Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject
to any of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture and will not guarantee the Notes.


-----

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

On the Issue Date, the Issuer will issue €    million in aggregate principal amount of Euro Notes and $     million in
aggregate principal amount of Dollar Notes. The Euro Notes and the Dollar Notes will mature on         , 2028 (the “Initial
Maturity Date”), provided that if at the date (a “Determination Date”) that is four months prior to the maturity date of any class
of outstanding Specified Indebtedness which is in an aggregate amount that, together with any outstanding Specified
Indebtedness in respect of a prior Determination Date, exceeds $250 million (or its equivalent in other currencies) and such
amount in excess of $250 million is not repaid, refinanced (with debt that has a maturity date falling at least 91 days after
February 7, 2028) or extended (to a maturity date falling at least 91 days after February 7, 2028) by such Determination Date,
the Initial Maturity Date shall be automatically adjusted to the maturity date of the Specified Indebtedness referred to in
paragraphs (a) to (d) below which is the earliest maturity date to follow such Determination Date: (a) to the extent such excess
outstanding Specified Indebtedness is in respect of the Second Lien Credit Facilities, such date falling 91 days prior to the
maturity date applicable to the Second Lien Credit Facilities; (b) to the extent such excess outstanding Specified Indebtedness
is in respect of the Existing Murray Notes, the maturity date applicable to the Existing Murray Notes; (c) to the extent such
excess outstanding Specified Indebtedness is in respect of the Existing Cirrus Notes, the maturity date applicable to the Existing
Cirrus Notes; or (d) to the extent such excess outstanding Specified Indebtedness is in respect of a Stub Facility remains
outstanding, the maturity date applicable to such Stub Facility. The Issuer will promptly provide notice to the Holders and the
Trustee of the occurrence of any adjustment to the Initial Maturity Date.

The Euro Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.
The Dollar Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of $200,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.
Interest on the Euro Notes and the Dollar Notes will be calculated on the aggregate principal amount of Euro Notes outstanding
and the aggregate principal amount of Dollar Notes outstanding, respectively.

Interest on the Euro Notes will accrue at the rate of          % per annum. Interest on the Dollar Notes will accrue at the rate
of          % per annum. Interest on the Notes will be payable semi-annually in arrears on          and          of each
year, commencing on         , 2024. Accrued and unpaid interest on each series of Notes will also be payable on the
maturity date for such series of Notes. The Issuer will make each interest payment to the Holders of record on the Business
Day immediately preceding the related interest payment date. Interest on the Notes will accrue from the Issue Date or, if interest
has already been paid, from the date it was most recently paid. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year
comprised of twelve 30-day months.

**Methods of Receiving Payments on the Notes**

The rights of Holders to receive the payments of interest on the Notes are subject to applicable procedures of DTC, Euroclear
and Clearstream. If the due date for any payment in respect of any Notes is not a Business Day at the place at which such
payment is due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due until the next succeeding
Business Day at such place, and will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result of any such delay.

Principal, interest and premium and Additional Amounts (as defined herein), if any, on the Global Notes (as defined below)
will be made by one or more Paying Agents by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account specified by the
registered Holder thereof (initially being Cede & Co., as nominee for DTC, in respect of the Dollar Notes and the common
depositary or its nominee for Euroclear and Clearstream, in respect of the Euro Notes, as applicable).

Principal, interest and premium, and Additional Amounts, if any, on any certificated securities (“Definitive Registered Notes”)
will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents maintained for such purposes in London, United
Kingdom. In addition, interest on the Definitive Registered Notes may be paid, at the option of the Issuer, by check mailed to
the address of the Holder entitled thereto as shown on the register of Holders of Notes for the Definitive Registered Notes. See
“—Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes” below.

**_Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes_**

The Issuer will maintain one or more Paying Agents for the Notes in each of (i) London, United Kingdom (the “Principal
Paying Agent”) and (ii) the borough of Manhattan, city of New York, New York State (the “U.S. Paying Agent”). The initial
Paying Agents will be Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch (as Principal Paying Agent) and Deutsche Bank Trust Company
Americas (as U.S. Paying Agent).

The Issuer will also maintain a registrar (the “Registrar”), a transfer agent with respect to the Euro Notes (the “Euro Notes
Transfer Agent”) and a transfer agent with respect to the Dollar Notes (the “Dollar Notes Transfer Agent” and together with
the Euro Notes Transfer Agent, the “Transfer Agents”). The initial Registrar will be Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas,


-----

the initial Euro Notes Transfer Agent will be Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, and the initial Dollar Notes Transfer Agent
will be Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas. The Registrar will maintain a register reflecting ownership of the Notes
outstanding from time to time, if any, and together with the Transfer Agents, will facilitate transfers of the Notes on behalf of
the Issuer.

The Issuer may change any Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent for the Notes without prior notice to the Holders of such
Notes. The Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar in respect of the Notes.

**Notes Guarantees**

**_General_**

Subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles, the obligations of the Issuer pursuant
to the Notes, including any payment obligation resulting from a Change of Control, will be guaranteed jointly and severally,
on a senior basis (each, a “Notes Guarantee” and together, the “Notes Guarantees”) on or around the Issue Date, by the Parent,
EG Finco Limited, EG Dutch Finco B.V., EG America, LLC, EG Retail (America), LLC, Cumberland Farms, Inc., Cumberland
Farms of Vermont, Inc., Cumberland Farms of Massachusetts, Inc., CFI GC LLC, Minit Mart LLC, Mini Mart, Inc., Quik Stop
Markets, Inc., TH Minit Markets LLC, EG Holdings B.V., EG Europe B.V., EG Retail B.V., EG (Benelux) B.V., EG Retail
(Belgium) BV, EG Services (Belgium Property) BV, EG Retail (Netherlands) B.V., EG Services (Netherlands) B.V., EG (Italy)
B.V., EG (France) B.V., EG Italia S.p.A., EG (Germany) B.V., EG Deutschland GmbH, Echo Tankstellen GmbH, Retail
Operating Company Deutschland GmbH, EG Group Australia Pty Ltd, EG AsiaPac Ltd, EG FuelCo (Australia) Limited and
EG Deutschland Retail & Energy GmbH (each, a “Guarantor” and together, the “Guarantors”). In addition, if required by the
covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Additional Notes Guarantees,” certain other Restricted Subsidiaries may
provide a Notes Guarantee in the future.

Subject to certain guarantee limitations set out therein, the Guarantors also guarantee the Existing Notes, the Senior Credit
Facilities and the Second Lien Credit Facilities on a senior basis.

The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the Existing
Notes, the Senior Credit Facilities, the Second Lien Credit Facilities and the Notes. The Agreed Security Principles include
limitations on our obligations to grant guarantees where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by general statutory
or other legal limitations or requirements, financial assistance rules, corporate benefit rules, fraudulent preference rules, “thin
_capitalization” rules, capital maintenance rules, retention of title claims and similar matters, or where the time and cost of_
granting the guarantee would be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the Holders.

As described below “—Certain Covenants—Additional Notes Guarantees” and subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and the
Agreed Security Principles, certain Subsidiaries of the Parent that guarantee the Existing Notes, the Senior Credit Facilities,
the Second Lien Credit Facilities, any Credit Facilities that refinance or replace any amounts outstanding under such Facilities,
any successor facilities thereof or any Existing Notes, or any Public Debt issued in the future, in each case of the Issuer or a
Guarantor, shall also enter into a supplemental indenture as a Guarantor of the Notes and accede to the Intercreditor Agreement.

Once granted, the Notes Guarantee of each of the Guarantors will:

- be a general senior obligation of that Guarantor, secured as set forth under “—Security”;

- rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future Indebtedness of that Guarantor that is not subordinated in
right of payment to such Notes Guarantee (including obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, the Existing
Notes, the Second Lien Credit Facilities Agreement and certain Hedging Obligations);

- rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future Indebtedness of that Guarantor that is expressly subordinated in
right of payment to such Notes Guarantee;

- be effectively senior to any existing or future indebtedness or obligation of that Guarantor that is secured on the Collateral
on a junior basis, including the Second Lien Credit Facilities, or that is not secured by the Collateral owned by that
Guarantor, in each case, to the extent of the value of such Collateral;

- be effectively subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or obligation of such Guarantor that is secured by
property or assets that do not secure such Notes Guarantee, to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing
such indebtedness or obligations; and


-----

- be structurally subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness (including obligations to trade creditors) of the
Subsidiaries of such Guarantor that are not Guarantors.

The obligations of a Guarantor under its Notes Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the relevant Notes Guarantee
from constituting a fraudulent conveyance or unlawful financial assistance under applicable law, or otherwise to reflect
limitations under applicable law. In addition, the Notes Guarantees will be further limited as required under the Agreed Security
Principles. By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Notes Guarantee could be significantly less than
amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Notes Guarantee. See
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—The Notes and the Guarantees will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement
_and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability.” The_
validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the liability of each Guarantor will be subject to the limitations
described in “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees
_and the Security Interests.”_

A portion of the operations of the Group will be conducted through Restricted Subsidiaries of the Parent that will not be
Guarantors. Claims of creditors of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries, including trade creditors and creditors holding debt
and guarantees issued by those Restricted Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred stockholders (if any) of those Restricted
Subsidiaries and minority stockholders of Subsidiaries of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries (if any) generally will have
priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Restricted Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Issuer and
the Guarantors, including the Holders. The Notes and each Notes Guarantee therefore will be structurally subordinated to
creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred stockholders (if any) of Restricted Subsidiaries of the Parent (other than the
Guarantors) and minority stockholders of Subsidiaries of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries (if any).

As of and for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, the Issuer and the Guarantors, as adjusted for the Pre-Offering
Transactions and excluding any intercompany balances and transactions, accounted for 79% of the total assets of the Group
and 83% of the Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16 of the Group.

As of June 30, 2023, and after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions, as if they had occurred on such date, (i) the Parent
and its consolidated Subsidiaries would have had $6,214 million (equivalent) of Indebtedness secured by the Collateral (as
defined below), including $663 million under the Second Lien Credit Facilities and $8 million (equivalent) of other financial
indebtedness outstanding and (ii) the non-Guarantor subsidiaries of the Parent would have had $3 of outstanding indebtedness,
in each case net of unamortized finance costs.

Although the Indenture will limit the Incurrence of Indebtedness and Disqualified Stock of the Parent and its Restricted
Subsidiaries and the Incurrence of Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a number of significant
exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture will not impose any limitation on the Incurrence by the Parent or Restricted Subsidiaries
of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the Indenture. See “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness.”_

**_Notes Guarantees Release_**

The Notes Guarantee of a Guarantor will terminate and be released:

- upon (a) a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of any Capital Stock of the relevant
Guarantor (whether by direct sale or sale of a holding company of such Guarantor) as a result of which such Guarantor
would no longer be a Restricted Subsidiary, or (b) the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Guarantor
(including by way of merger, consolidation, amalgamation or combination) (other than to the Parent or a Restricted
Subsidiary), otherwise not prohibited by the Indenture;

- upon the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary;

- upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes in accordance with the Indenture,
as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge”;

- in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

- as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”;

- (i) upon the release or discharge of the Guarantee and any other obligations of such Guarantor under the Senior Credit
Facilities Agreement and the Second Lien Credit Facilities Agreement, except a release or discharge by or as a result of


-----

the repayment of any such facilities (other than pursuant to a refinancing in which such Guarantor does not provide a
Guarantee); _provided that the Guarantee of such Guarantor under any outstanding Existing Notes is also released or_
discharged at such time (or will be released or discharged substantially concurrently with the release or discharge of the
Notes Guarantee of such Guarantor); or (ii) as otherwise described in the second paragraph of the covenant described
below under “—Certain Covenants—Additional Notes Guarantees”;

- as a result of a transaction permitted by “—Merger and Consolidation”;

- in connection with a Permitted Reorganization; or

- upon the full and final payment and performance of all obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Indenture
and the Notes.

The Trustee and the Security Agent (as applicable) shall each take all necessary actions reasonably requested by the Issuer,
including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and
delivery of evidence of release, to effectuate any release of a Notes Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to
customary protections and indemnifications. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Trustee without the
consent of the Holders and will not require any other action or consent on the part of the Trustee. The Trustee and the Security
Agent shall be entitled to request and rely conclusively upon an Officer’s Certificate and Opinion of Counsel, each certifying
which circumstance, as described above, giving rise to a release of the Notes Guarantee has occurred and that such release
complies with the Indenture. Neither the Trustee nor the Issuer will be required to make a notation on the Notes to reflect any
such release, termination or discharge. The Issuer may in its sole discretion elect to have any Notes Guarantee remain in place,
as opposed to being released.

**Security**

**_General_**

The Notes and the Notes Guarantees in respect thereof will be secured on a first-priority basis within 90 days from the
Conditions Satisfaction Date, subject to and without prejudice to the below with reference to the Italian Law Share Pledge, by:

- certain assets, including material bank accounts, structural intercompany receivables and certain properties of the Issuer,
Midco, the Parent, EG Finco Limited, EG AsiaPac Ltd., EVPoint Services Limited, EG On The Move Limited, EG
Corporate Services Limited, EG Property Limited, Clokken Limited and EGspresso Limited;

- the issued shares in the Issuer, the Parent, EG Finco Limited, EG Retail (America), LLC, Minit Mart, LLC, Mini Mart,
Inc., Quik Stop Markets, Inc., TH Minit Markets LLC, Cumberland Farms, Inc., Cumberland Farms of Vermont, Inc.,
Cumberland Farms of Massachusetts, Inc., CFI GC LLC, EG Dutch Finco B.V., EG Retail (Netherlands) B.V., EG
Services (Netherlands) B.V., EG (Germany) B.V., EG Retail (Belgium) BV, EG America, LLC, EG Deutschland GmbH,
Echo Tankstellen GmbH, Retail Operating Company Deutschland GmbH, EG Deutschland Retail & Energy GmbH, EG
Group Australia Pty Ltd. and EG FuelCo (Australia) Limited;

- the structural intercompany receivables (if any) owed to EG Dutch Finco B.V., EG Holdings B.V., EG Europe B.V., EG
Retail B.V., EG (Benelux) B.V., EG (France) B.V., EG (Italy) B.V., EG Retail (Netherlands) B.V., EG Services
(Netherlands) B.V., EG (Germany) B.V., EG Retail (Belgium) BV, EG Services (Belgium Property) BV, EG Deutschland
GmbH, Echo Tankstellen GmbH, Retail Operating Company Deutschland GmbH and EG Deutschland Retail & Energy
GmbH;

- the material bank accounts of EG Dutch Finco B.V., EG Holdings B.V., EG Europe B.V., EG Retail B.V., EG (Benelux)
B.V., EG (France) B.V., EG (Italy) B.V., EG Retail (Netherlands) B.V., EG Services (Netherlands) B.V., EG (Germany)
B.V., EG Retail (Belgium) BV, EG Services (Belgium Property) BV, EG Italia S.p.A., EG Deutschland GmbH, Echo
Tankstellen GmbH, Retail Operating Company Deutschland GmbH and EG Deutschland Retail & Energy GmbH; and

- certain assets of EG America, LLC, EG Retail (America), LLC, Minit Mart, LLC, Mini Mart, Inc., Quik Stop Markets,
Inc., TH Minit Markets LLC, Cumberland Farms, Inc., Cumberland Farms of Vermont, Inc., Cumberland Farms of
Massachusetts, Inc., CFI GC LLC, EG FuelCo (Australia) Limited, and EG Group Australia Pty Ltd. (together, the
“Collateral”).

As soon as reasonably practicable and no later than 10 Business Days following the Issue Date, we will submit an application
with the Italian Golden Power Authority pursuant to the Italian Golden Power Legislation in order for the Italian Law Share


-----

Pledge to be extended as security for the Notes and Guarantees. On the date that is the later of (a) 90 days following the
Conditions Satisfaction Date and (b) 10 days following receipt of the Italian Golden Power Clearance, the Notes and Guarantees
will be secured by first-ranking security interests (to be granted or reconfirmed and extended) over all of the issued shares of
EG Italia S.p.A. (the “Italian Law Share Pledge”), subject to the Agreed Security Principles and the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Security Interests in the Collateral are or will be granted to the Security Agent on behalf of and for the benefit of the
Holders pursuant to the Security Documents. Any other security interests that may in the future be granted to secure obligations
under the Notes, any Notes Guarantees and the Indenture would also constitute “Collateral.” All Collateral is or will be subject
to the operation of the Agreed Security Principles and any Permitted Collateral Liens. References to first-priority Security
Interests include Security Interests that were created at different points in time and thus with different chronological priority,
but are contractually treated as being pari passu with prior-ranking Security interests and entitled to equal treatment with other
prior-ranking security secured creditors pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement.

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Collateral also secures (i) the Existing Notes, the Senior Credit Facilities, certain
Hedging Obligations and certain other future indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the Indenture on a first-priority basis
and (ii) the Second Lien Credit Facilities on a junior priority basis. In addition, under certain circumstances, including a
repayment in full of the amounts outstanding under the Senior Credit Facilities, certain Indebtedness and Hedging Obligations
may be re-designated as “super senior” obligations under the Intercreditor Agreement, and following such re-designation,
Holders will only receive proceeds from the Collateral after such super senior obligations have been paid in full. See
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements —Intercreditor Agreement” and “Certain Definitions—Permitted Collateral
_Liens.”_

Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of
_Security Interests” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens,” the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries will be permitted_
to grant security over the Collateral in connection with future issuances of Indebtedness, including Additional Notes, as
permitted under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Liens on the Collateral will be limited as necessary to recognize certain limitations arising under or imposed by local law
and defenses generally available to providers of Collateral (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer,
voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or
defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law. For a brief description of such
limitations, see “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees
_and the Security Interests” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—The enforcement and, according to a prudential_
_interpretation, the granting/extension of the pledge over the shares of EG Italia will require clearance under the Italian Golden_
_Power Legislation.”_

Without limiting the foregoing and the provisions of the covenant described below under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation
_on Liens,” certain property, rights and assets may not be pledged, and any pledge over property, rights and assets may be limited_
(or the Liens not perfected), in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles. The following is a non-exhaustive summary of
certain terms of the Agreed Security Principles, which include, among others:

- general legal and statutory limitations, regulatory restrictions, financial assistance, anti-trust and other competition
authority restrictions, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, equitable subordination, “transfer pricing,” “thin
_capitalization,” “earnings stripping,” “controlled foreign corporation” and other tax restrictions, “exchange control_
_restrictions,” “capital maintenance” rules and “liquidity impairment” rules, tax restrictions, retention of title claims,_
employee consultation or approval requirements and similar principles may limit the ability of the Group to provide a
guarantee or security or may require that the guarantee or security be limited as to amount or otherwise and, if so, the
guarantee or security will be limited accordingly; _provided_ that, to the extent requested by the Security Agent before
signing any applicable security or accession document, the relevant member of the Group shall use reasonable endeavors
(but without incurring material cost and without adverse impact on relationships with third parties) to overcome any such
obstacle or otherwise such guarantee or security document shall be subject to such limit;

- a key factor in determining whether or not a guarantee or security will be taken (and in respect of the security, the extent
of its perfection and/or registration) is the applicable time and cost (including adverse effects on taxes, interest
deductibility, stamp duty, registration taxes, notarial costs and all applicable legal fees) which will not be disproportionate
to the benefit accruing to the secured parties of obtaining such guarantee or security;

- members of the Group will not be required to give guarantees or enter into security documents if they are not whollyowned by another member of the Group or if it is not within the legal capacity of the relevant members of the Group or if


-----

it would conflict with the fiduciary or statutory duties of their directors or contravene any applicable legal, regulatory or
contractual prohibition or restriction or have the potential to result in a material risk of personal or criminal liability for
any director or officer of or for any member of the Group; _provided that, to the extent requested by the Security Agent_
before signing any applicable security document or accession document, the relevant member of the Group shall use
reasonable endeavors (but without incurring material cost and without adverse impact on relationships with third parties)
to overcome any such obstacle or otherwise such guarantee or security document shall be subject to such limit;

- guarantees and security will be limited so that the aggregate of notarial costs and all registration and like taxes and duties
relating to the provision of security will not exceed an amount to be agreed between the grantor of the security and the
Security Agent;

- where a class of assets to be secured includes material and immaterial assets, if the cost of granting security over the
immaterial assets is disproportionate to the benefit of such security, security is or will be granted over the material assets
only;

- it is expressly acknowledged that it may be either impossible or impractical to create security over certain categories of
assets in which event security will not be taken over such assets;

- any asset subject to a legal requirement, contract, lease, license, instrument, regulatory constraint (including any agreement
with any government or regulatory body) or other third party arrangement, which may prevent or condition the asset from
being charged, secured or being subject to the applicable security document (including requiring a consent of any third
party, supervisory board or works council (or equivalent)) and any asset which, if subject to the applicable security
document, would give a third party the right to terminate or otherwise amend any rights, benefits and/or obligations with
respect to any member of the Group in respect of the asset or require the relevant chargor to take any action materially
adverse to the interests of the Group or any member thereof, in each case will be excluded from a guarantee or security
document; provided that reasonable endeavors (exercised for a specified period of time) to obtain consent to charging any
asset (where otherwise prohibited) shall be used by the Group if the Security Agent specifies prior to the date of the security
or accession document that the asset is material and the Parent is satisfied that such endeavors will not involve placing
relationships with third parties in jeopardy;

- the giving of a guarantee, the granting of security and the registration and/or the perfection of the security granted will not
be required if it would have a material adverse effect on the ability of the relevant member of the Group to conduct its
operations and business in the ordinary course as otherwise permitted by the Finance Documents (as defined in the section
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements —Intercreditor Agreement” above) (including dealing with the secured
assets and all contractual counterparties or amending, waiving or terminating (or allowing to lapse) any rights, benefits or
obligations, in each case prior to an Acceleration Event (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) which is continuing),
and any requirement under the Agreed Security Principles to seek consent of any person or take or not take any other action
shall be subject to the Agreed Security Principles;

- security will not be required over any assets subject to security in favor of a third party (other than in relation to security
under general business conditions of account banks which do not prohibit or prevent the creation of security over such
accounts) or any cash constituting regulatory capital or customer cash (and such assets or cash shall be excluded from any
relevant security document);

- to the extent legally effective, all security shall be given in favor of the Security Agent and not the secured parties
individually (with the Security Agent to hold one set of security documents for all the secured parties); “parallel debt”
provisions will be used where necessary (and included in the Intercreditor Agreement and not the individual security
documents); no member of the Group will be required to take any action in relation to any guarantees or security as a result
of any assignment or transfer by a Secured Party;

- guarantees and security will not be required from or over the assets of, any joint venture or similar arrangement, any
minority interest or any member of the Group that is not wholly-owned by another member of the Group; and

- no security may be provided on terms which are inconsistent with the turnover or sharing provisions in the Intercreditor
Agreement.

The Agreed Security Principles with respect to the Notes will be interpreted and applied in good faith by the Issuer.


-----

As described above, all of the Collateral also secures the liabilities under the Existing Notes, the Senior Credit Facilities
Agreement and the Second Lien Credit Facilities Agreement and may also secure certain Hedging Obligations, any Additional
Notes as well as certain other future Indebtedness, certain of which may be entitled to payment from the proceeds of an
enforcement of the Collateral in priority to the Notes. The proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral may not be sufficient
to satisfy the obligations owed to the Holders.

No appraisals of the Collateral have been made in connection with this Offering of the Notes. By its nature, some or all of the
Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, the Collateral may not be able to
be sold in a short period of time, or at all. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—It may be difficult to realize the value
_of the Collateral securing the Notes.”_

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Indenture, no property or asset of Midco, the Parent, or any Restricted
Subsidiary that is subject to a floating charge only (and not to any other Lien) under any Security Document shall be deemed
Collateral (including for purposes of determining whether a Permitted Lien is permitted over such asset or property) pursuant
to the covenant under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens,” and the granting or existence of such Permitted Lien over
such asset or property shall be deemed neither to be a breach of the covenant under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of
_Security Interest,” nor a Default or an Event of Default under the security default provision set forth in “—Events of Default,”_
in each case for so long as such floating charge has not crystallized into a fixed charge.

**_Priority_**

The relative priority with regard to the security interests in the Collateral that are created by the Security Documents (the
“Security Interests” and each, a “Security Interest”) as between (a) the lenders under the Senior Credit Facilities, (b) the
counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations, (c) the Trustee, the Security Agent, the Paying Agents, the Transfer Agents,
the Registrar and the Holders under the Indenture, (d) the corresponding parties under the Existing Indentures and the holders
of the Existing Notes, (e) the lenders under the Second Lien Credit Facilities and (f) the creditors of certain other Indebtedness
(including Indebtedness that may be Incurred in the future) permitted to be secured by the Collateral, respectively, will be
established by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, which will provide, among other things, that the first priority security
interests securing the Notes are contractually deemed to rank (A) equally with the security interests that secure (but only to the
extent that such security is expressed to secure those liabilities) (i) obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities, (ii) the
Existing Notes, (iii) certain obligations under hedging arrangements and (iv) certain other future indebtedness permitted to be
incurred under the Indenture and (B) senior to the security interests that secure obligations under the Second Lien Credit
Facilities Agreement.

In addition, under certain circumstances, including a repayment in full of the amounts outstanding under the Senior Credit
Facilities, the Revolving Credit Facility may be re-designated as a “super senior” obligation under the Intercreditor Agreement,
and following such re-designation, Holders will only receive proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral after such super
senior obligations (and certain super senior Hedging Obligations) have been paid in full. See “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements —Intercreditor Agreement,” “—Security—Release of Liens,” “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security_
_Interests” and “—Certain Definitions—Permitted Collateral Liens.”_

**_Security Documents_**

Under the Security Documents, the relevant security providers have granted or will grant security over the Collateral to secure
the payment when due of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ payment obligations under the Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the
Indenture. The Security Documents have been or will be entered into by the relevant security provider and the Security Agent
as agent for the secured parties. When entering into the Security Documents, the Security Agent has acted or will act in its own
name, but for the benefit of the secured parties (including itself, the Trustee and the Holders from time to time). Under the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent also acts as an agent of the lenders under the Senior Credit Facilities and the
Second Lien Credit Facilities and the holders of the Existing Notes in relation to the Security Interests created in favor of such
parties.

The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, to the extent permitted by the applicable laws, only the
Security Agent will have the right to enforce the Security Documents on behalf of the Trustee and the Holders. As a
consequence of such contractual provisions, Holders will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral,
except through the Trustee under the Indenture, who will (subject to the provisions of the Indenture) provide instructions to the
Security Agent for the Collateral. In certain jurisdictions, due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the creation and
perfection of Security Interests, the relevant Security Documents secure or will secure “parallel debt” obligations created under
the Intercreditor Agreement in favor of the Security Agent (and not the obligations under the Notes and the Notes Guarantees).
The parallel debt construct has not been fully tested under law in certain of these jurisdictions. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related


-----

_to the Notes—The security over the Collateral will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes and the concept of “trust”_
_is not a recognized concept in certain jurisdictions.”_

The Indenture will provide that, subject to the terms thereof and of the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement,
the Notes and the Indenture, as applicable, will be secured by Security Interests in the Collateral until all obligations under the
Notes and the Indenture have been discharged. However, the Security Interests with respect to the Notes and the Indenture may
be released under certain circumstances as provided under “—Security—Release of Liens.”

In the event that the Parent or its Subsidiaries enter into insolvency, bankruptcy or similar proceedings, the Security Interests
created under the Security Documents or the rights and obligations enumerated in the Intercreditor Agreement could be subject
to potential challenges. If any challenge to the validity of the Security Interests or the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement was
successful, the Holders may not be able to recover any amounts under the Security Documents. See “Risk Factors—Risks
_Related to the Notes—The granting of the security interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes, or the incurrence of_
_permitted debt in the future, may create or restart hardening periods.”_

**_Enforcement of Security Interest_**

The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will restrict the ability of the Holders or the Trustee to enforce the Security
Interests and provide for the release of the Security Interests created by the Security Documents in certain circumstances upon
enforcement by the Security Agent in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. These limitations are described
under “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements —Intercreditor Agreement” and “Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests.” The ability to_
enforce may also be restricted by similar arrangements in relation to future Indebtedness that is secured on the Collateral in
compliance with the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.

The creditors under the Senior Credit Facilities and the Second Lien Credit Facilities, the counterparties to Hedging Obligations
secured by the Collateral, the Existing Notes Trustee and the Trustee have and, by accepting a Note, each Holder will be deemed
to have, appointed the Security Agent to act as its agent under the Intercreditor Agreement and the security documents securing
such Indebtedness, including the Security Documents. The creditors under the Senior Credit Facilities and the Second Lien
Credit Facilities, the counterparties to Hedging Obligations secured by the Collateral, the Existing Notes Trustee and the Trustee
have and, by accepting a Note, each Holder will be deemed to have, authorized the Security Agent to (i) perform the duties and
exercise the rights, powers and discretions that are specifically given to it under the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security
Documents securing such Indebtedness, together with any other incidental rights, power and discretions and (ii) execute each
Security Document, waiver, modification, amendment, renewal or replacement expressed to be executed by the Security Agent
on its behalf.

**_Intercreditor Agreement; Additional Intercreditor Agreements; Agreement to be Bound_**

The Indenture will provide that the Issuer and the Trustee will be authorized (without any further consent of the Holders) to
enter into the Intercreditor Agreement to give effect to the provisions described in the section entitled “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements —Intercreditor Agreement.”_

The Indenture will also provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, will be deemed to have:

(1) appointed and authorized the Security Agent and the Trustee to give effect to the provisions in the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents and perform
the duties and exercise the rights, powers and discretions that are specifically given to it under the
Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents securing such Indebtedness, together with any other
incidental rights, power and discretions;

(2) agreed to be bound by the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements
and the Security Documents; and

(3) irrevocably appointed the Security Agent and the Trustee to act on its behalf to enter into and comply with
the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the Security
Documents (including the execution of, and compliance with, any waiver, modification, amendment, renewal
or replacement expressed to be executed by the Trustee or the Security Agent on its behalf).

See the section entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—The security over the Collateral will not be granted directly
_to the holders of the Notes and the concept of “trust” is not a recognized concept in certain jurisdictions.”_


-----

Similar provisions to those described above may be included in any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (as defined below)
entered into in compliance with the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements.”

**_Release of Liens_**

Release of the Security Interests in respect of the Collateral will be permitted under any one or more of the following
circumstances:

(1) other than with respect to the Liens granted over the Capital Stock of the Parent held by Midco, in connection
with any sale or other disposition of Collateral to (a) a Person that is not the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary
(but excluding any transaction subject to “—Merger and _Consolidation”), if such sale or other disposition_
does not violate the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and
_Subsidiary Stock” and is otherwise not prohibited by the Indenture or (b) any Restricted Subsidiary; provided_
that this clause 1(b) shall not be relied upon in the case of a transfer of Capital Stock or intercompany loan
receivables to a Restricted Subsidiary (except to a Receivables Subsidiary) unless the relevant property and
assets remain subject to, or otherwise become subject to, a senior ranking Lien in favor of the Notes following
such sale or disposal;

(2) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Notes Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the Indenture,
the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Guarantor;

(3) with respect to any Collateral, upon the release or discharge of the security interests granted over such
Collateral in favor of the lenders under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement and the Second Lien Credit
Facilities Agreement, except a release or discharge by or as a result of the repayment of any such facilities
(other than pursuant to a refinancing in which the refinancing Indebtedness does not benefit from any security
interest in such Collateral); provided that the security interests over such Collateral granted in favor of the
holders of any outstanding Existing Notes are also released or discharged at such time (or will be released or
discharged substantially concurrently with the release or discharge of the security interests over such
Collateral granted in favor of the Holders of the Notes);

(4) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens”;

(5) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Notes or legal defeasance, covenant
defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes, as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and
_Discharge”;_

(6) if the Issuer designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such
Unrestricted Subsidiary, and the release of any assets designated by the Issuer as Receivables Assets in
connection with a Receivables Financing;

(7) in connection with a Permitted Reorganization; or

(8) as otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture.

In addition, the Liens created by the Security Documents will be released (a) in accordance with the provisions of the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and (b) as may be permitted by the covenant described
under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interests.”

The Security Agent and, to the extent reasonably required, the Trustee will take all necessary action reasonably requested by
the Issuer to effectuate any release of Collateral securing the Notes and the Notes Guarantees, in accordance with the provisions
of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant Security Document.
Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Security Agent without the consent of the Holders or any action on
the part of the Trustee (unless action is required by it to effect such release). The Security Agent and the Trustee shall be entitled
to request and rely conclusively upon an Officer’s Certificate and Opinion of Counsel, each certifying which circumstance, as
described above, giving rise to a release of the Security Interests has occurred, and that such release complies with the Indenture.

**Transfer and Exchange**

The Notes will initially be issued as follows:


-----

- each series of Euro Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the
Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached
(the “144A Global Euro Notes”) and each series of Dollar Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional
buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered
form without interest coupons attached (the “144A Global Dollar Notes” and together with the 144A Global Euro Notes,
the “144A Global Notes”). The 144A Global Euro Notes will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with and registered in the
name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable. The 144A
Global Dollar Notes will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with and registered in the name of the nominee for DTC; and

- each series of Euro Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act will initially be
represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Temporary Regulation
S Global Euro Notes”) and each series of Dollar Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the
Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached
(the “Temporary Regulation S Global Dollar Notes”). After the 40th day following the later of the commencement of this
offering and the closing of this offering, the Temporary Regulation S Global Euro Notes will be exchanged for permanent
Regulation S global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Permanent Regulation S Global Euro
Notes”) and the Temporary Regulation S Global Dollar Notes will be exchanged for permanent Regulation S global notes
in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Permanent Regulation S Global Dollar Notes”, together with
the Permanent Regulation S Global Euro Notes, the Temporary Regulation S Global Euro Notes and the Temporary
Regulation S Global Dollar Notes, the “Regulation S Global Notes,” and, together with the 144A Global Notes, the “Global
Notes”). The Temporary Regulation S Global Euro Notes will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with and registered in the
name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable. The
Temporary Regulation S Global Dollar Notes will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with and registered in the name of the
nominee for DTC.

Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (“Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have accounts with DTC,
Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, or persons that may hold interests through such participants.

Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions on transfer and
certification requirements summarized below and described more fully under “Notice to Investors” In addition, transfers of
Book-Entry Interests between participants in DTC, participants in Euroclear or participants in Clearstream will be effected by
DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream pursuant to customary procedures and subject to the applicable rules and procedures
established by DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream and their respective participants.

Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes (the “144A Book-Entry Interests”) may be transferred to a Person who takes
delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests”)
representing Notes of the same series only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the
Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act.

Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a Person who takes delivery in the form of 144A Book-Entry Interests
representing Notes of the same series only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the
Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a Person who the transferor reasonably believes is a “qualified
institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A and in accordance
with any applicable state securities law.

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will, upon transfer, cease to
be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and will become a Book-Entry Interest in the Global
Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if
any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in the Global Note to which it was transferred.

No Book-Entry Interest in any Global Note representing the Euro Notes (the “Global Euro Notes”), and no Definitive
Registered Note issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Euro Notes (the “Definitive Registered Euro
Notes”), may be transferred or exchanged for any Book-Entry Interest in any Global Note representing the Dollar Notes (the
“Global Dollar Notes”) or any Definitive Registered Note issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Dollar
Notes (the “Definitive Registered Dollar Notes”), and no Book-Entry Interest in the Global Dollar Notes and no Definitive
Registered Dollar Note may be transferred or exchanged for any Book-Entry Interest in any Global Euro Note or any Definitive
Registered Euro Note.


-----

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of €100,000 principal amount,
and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof (in the case of the Euro Notes) and $200,000 principal amount, and integral
multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof (in the case of the Dollar Notes), upon receipt by the Registrar of instructions relating
thereto and any certificates, opinions and other documentation required by the Indenture. It is expected that such instructions
will be based upon directions received by DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, from the participant which owns the
relevant Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest will, except as set
forth in the Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Issuer in compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and will have
a legend with respect to, the restrictions on transfer summarized above and described more fully under “Notice to Investors.”
Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Euro Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred
or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of €100,000 in principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000
in excess thereof and Dollar Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part,
in minimum denominations of $200,000 in principal amount and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. In connection
with any such transfer or exchange, the Indenture will require the transferring or exchanging Holder to, among other things,
furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, to furnish information regarding the account of the transferee at
DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, where appropriate, to furnish certain certificates and opinions, and to pay any Taxes in
connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made without charge to the Holder, other
than any Taxes payable in connection with such transfer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Registrar and the Transfer Agents are not required to register the transfer or exchange of
any Definitive Registered Notes:

(1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of the Notes;

(2) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of Notes to be redeemed in part;

(3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date; or

(4) which the Holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of Control
Offer or an Asset Disposition Offer.

The Issuer, the Trustee, the Security Agent, the Paying Agents, the Transfer Agents and the Registrar will be entitled to treat
the registered Holder as the owner thereof for all purposes.

**Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries**

Immediately after the Issue Date, all of the Parent’s Subsidiaries will be Restricted Subsidiaries. However, in the circumstances
described below under “—Certain Covenants—Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries,” subject to the last
paragraph of the covenant described under _“—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments,” the Parent will be_
permitted to designate Restricted Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries. Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any
of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture and will not guarantee, or provide security with respect to, the Notes.

**_General_**

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for the Notes, including a Change of Control Offer or Asset
Disposition Offer, if Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the applicable outstanding Notes validly
tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer, or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu
of the Issuer, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer or such third party will
have the right upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such tender
offer expiration date, to redeem the Notes that remain outstanding in whole, but not in part following such purchase at a price
equal to the price offered to each other Holder (excluding any early tender or incentive fee) in such tender offer, plus, to the


-----

extent not included in the tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, thereon, to, but
excluding, such redemption date.

Subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Notes may be
repurchased at any time and from time to time by us or our Affiliates in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions
with third parties or pursuant to one or more tender or exchange offers or otherwise, upon such terms and at such prices as well
as with such consideration as the Parent or any such Affiliates may determine.

Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under “—Selection and Notice” below.

If the optional redemption date is on or after a record date and on or before the corresponding interest payment date, the accrued
and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date will be paid on the redemption date to the Holder in whose name
the Note is registered at the close of business on such record date in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC,
Euroclear and Clearstream, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Notes will be subject to redemption by
the Issuer.

Unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions thereof
called for redemption on the applicable redemption date.

**Mandatory Redemption or Sinking Fund**

The Issuer is not required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes.
However, under certain circumstances, the Issuer may be required to offer to purchase Notes as described under “—Change of
_Control” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock.”_

**Selection and Notice**

In the event that any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, will
redeem an equal amount of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note from the amount received by them in respect of the
redemption of such Global Note. The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry Interests
will be equal to the amount received by DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of
such Global Note (or any portion thereof). Under the existing practices and procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, if
fewer than all of the Euro Notes or the Dollar Notes, as applicable, are to be redeemed at any time, DTC, Euroclear or
Clearstream will credit their respective participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions),
including by way of pool factor (to the extent applicable), unless otherwise required by law or applicable stock exchange,
clearing system or depositary requirements; provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest of less than €100,000 principal
amount with respect to the applicable Euro Notes and less than $200,000 principal amount with respect to Dollar Notes may
be redeemed in part. If the Notes are not held through DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, the Notes will be selected on a _pro_
_rata basis, subject to adjustments so that no Note in an unauthorized denomination remains outstanding after such redemption;_
_provided, however, that no Euro Note of €100,000 in aggregate principal amount or less shall be redeemed in part and only_
Euro Notes in integral multiples of €1,000 shall be redeemed and that no Dollar Note of $200,000 in aggregate principal amount
or less shall be redeemed in part and only Dollar Notes in integral multiples of $1,000 shall be redeemed. The Trustee, the
Paying Agents and the Registrar shall not be liable for selections made under this paragraph.

Notices of redemption will be delivered electronically or mailed by first-class mail at least 10 days but not more than 60 days
before the redemption date to each Holder of Notes to be redeemed at the address of such Holder appearing in the security
register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, except that redemption
notices may be delivered electronically or mailed more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in
connection with a defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture.

Notice of any redemption of Notes may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be given prior to the completion of a transaction (including,
but not limited to, an Equity Offering, an Incurrence of Indebtedness, a Change of Control or other transaction) and any
redemption notice may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent, including, but not limited to,
completion of a related transaction. If such redemption or purchase is so subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions
precedent, such notice shall describe each such condition, and if applicable, shall state that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the
redemption date may be delayed until such time (provided, however, that any redemption date shall not be more than 60 days
after the date of the notice of redemption) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied or waived, or such redemption or
purchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been
satisfied or waived by the redemption date, or by the redemption date as so delayed. In addition, the Issuer may provide in such
notice that payment of the redemption price and performance of the Issuer’s obligations with respect to such redemption may


-----

be performed by another Person, and such notice of redemption may be extended or waived by the Issuer by notice to the
Holders.

If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note shall state the portion of the
principal amount thereof to be redeemed, in which case a portion of the original Note will be issued in the name of the Holder
thereof upon cancellation of the original Note. In the case of a Global Note, an appropriate notation will be made on such Note
to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the
applicable redemption notice (including any conditions contained therein), Notes called for redemption become due on the date
fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date, unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price,
interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of them called for redemption.

If requested by the Issuer in writing to the Trustee and Principal Paying Agent (which request may be included in the applicable
notice of redemption or pursuant to the above referenced Officer’s Certificate) no later than four Business Days prior to such
distribution, the Trustee shall distribute any amount deposited in trust to the Holders prior to the applicable redemption date.
For the avoidance of doubt, the distribution and payment to Holders prior to the applicable redemption date as set forth above
will not include any negative interest, present value adjustment, break costs or any other premium on such amounts. To the
extent the Notes are represented by Global Notes deposited with a common depositary for a clearing system, any payment to
the beneficial holders holding Book-Entry Interests as participants of such clearing system will be subject to the then applicable
procedures of such clearing system.

**Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

The Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at its discretion at any time upon giving not less than 10 nor more
than 60 days’ prior written notice to the Holders (which notice will be irrevocable) at a redemption price equal to 100% of the
principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date fixed for redemption (a
“Tax Redemption Date”) (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the
relevant interest payment date) and all Additional Amounts, as defined below under “—Withholding Taxes,” if any, then due
and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise, if the Issuer determines
that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations, protocols, official guidance or rulings
promulgated thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below) affecting taxation; or

(2) any amendment to, or change in an official application, administration or written interpretation of such laws,
treaties, regulations, protocols, official guidance or rulings (including by reason of a holding, judgment or
order by a court of competent jurisdiction or a change in published administrative practice) (each of the
foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a “Change in Tax Law”),

a Payor (as defined below) is, or on the next interest payment date in respect of the Notes would be, required to pay Additional
Amounts with respect to the Notes or the Note Guarantee, as applicable (but, in the case of a Guarantor, only if the payment
giving rise to such requirement cannot be made by the Issuer or another Guarantor who can make such payment without the
obligation to pay Additional Amounts), and such obligation cannot be avoided by taking reasonable measures available to the
Payor (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the appointment of a new Paying Agent where this would be reasonable). Such
Change in Tax Law must be formally announced and become effective on or after the Issue Date (or if the applicable Relevant
Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date, such later date). The foregoing
provisions shall apply (a) to a Guarantor only after such time as such Guarantor is obligated to make at least one payment on
the Notes and (b) mutatis mutandis to any successor Person, after such successor Person becomes a party to the Indenture, with
respect to a Change in Tax Law occurring after the time such successor Person becomes a party to the Indenture.

Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described under “—Selection
_and Notice.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest_
date on which the Payor would be obligated to make such payment of Additional Amounts. Prior to the publication or mailing
of any notice of redemption of Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate
stating that it is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent
to its right to so redeem have been satisfied and that the obligation to pay Additional Amounts cannot be avoided by the relevant
Payor taking reasonable measures available to it and (b) a written opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognized standing
qualified under the laws of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below in “—Withholding Taxes”) and satisfactory to
the Trustee (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld) to the effect that the Payor has been or will become obligated to
pay Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely conclusively


-----

on such Officer’s Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above,
without further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

**Withholding Taxes**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor (including any successor entity) (each, a “Payor”) in respect
of the Notes or with respect to any Notes Guarantee, as applicable, will be made free and clear of and without withholding or
deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required by law or by the
relevant taxing authority’s interpretation or administration thereof. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any
Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Note is made or any political subdivision or
governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (including the jurisdiction of the Paying
Agent); or

(2) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax purposes, or
otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or governmental authority
thereof or therein having the power to tax (each of clause (1) and (2), a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”),

will at any time be required by law to be made from any payments made by or on behalf of the Payor with respect to any Note
or any Notes Guarantee, including (without limitation) payments of principal, redemption price, interest or premium, if any,
the Payor will pay (together with such payments) such additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary in
order that the net amounts received by each Holder in respect of such payments, after such withholding or deduction (including
any such withholding or deduction from such Additional Amounts), will not be less than the amounts which would have been
received by each Holder in respect of such payments on any such Note or Notes Guarantee in the absence of such withholding
or deduction; provided, however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of:

(1) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or
former connection between the relevant Holder (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member, partner
or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder, if the relevant Holder is an estate, nominee,
trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including,
without limitation, being resident for tax purposes, or being a citizen or resident or national of, or carrying
on a business or maintaining a permanent establishment in or place of management present or deemed present
in, or being physically present in, the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any
connection arising solely from the acquisition, ownership or holding of such Note or the receipt of any
payment or the exercise or enforcement of rights under such Note, the Indenture or a Notes Guarantee;

(2) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or the
beneficial owner of the Note to comply with a written request by or on behalf of the Payor addressed to the
Holder or beneficial owner, after reasonable notice (at least 30 days before any such withholding or deduction
would be payable), to provide certification, information, documents or other evidence concerning the
nationality, residence or identity of the Holder or such beneficial owner or to make any declaration or similar
claim or satisfy any other reporting requirement relating to such matters, which is required by a law, statute,
treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to
exemption from, or reduction in the rate of deduction or withholding of, all or part of such Tax, but, in each
case, only to the extent the Holder or beneficial owner is legally entitled to do so;

(3) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed as a result of the presentation of the Note for payment (where
Notes are in the form of Definitive Registered Notes and presentation is required) more than 30 days after
the later of the applicable payment date or the date the relevant payment is first made available for payment
to the Holder;

(4) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment with respect to the
Notes or with respect to any Notes Guarantee;

(5) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, excise, transfer, personal property or similar Taxes;

(6) any Taxes imposed, deducted or withheld pursuant to section 1471(b) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code or
otherwise imposed pursuant to sections 1471 through 1474 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, in each case,
as of the Issue Date (and any amended or successor version that is substantively comparable), any current or


-----

future regulations or agreements thereunder, official interpretations thereof or similar law or regulation
implementing an intergovernmental agreement relating thereto;

(7) any tax that is imposed or levied by the Netherlands pursuant to the Dutch Withholding Tax Act 2021 (Wet
_bronbelasting 2021); or_

(8) any combination of the items (1) through (7) above.

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to a Holder who is a fiduciary or a partnership or any Person
other than the beneficial owner of the Notes, to the extent that the beneficiary or settler with respect to such fiduciary, the
member of such partnership or the beneficial owner would not have been entitled to Additional Amounts had such beneficiary,
settler, member or beneficial owner held such Notes directly.

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the
relevant tax authority in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will use reasonable endeavors to obtain and provide
certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, or if such tax receipts are not available, certified copies of other reasonable evidence of such
payments as soon as reasonably practicable to the Trustee (with a copy to the Principal Paying Agent). Such copies shall be
made available to the Holders upon reasonable request and will be made available at the offices of the Principal Paying Agent.

If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to any payment made on any Note or any Notes Guarantee,
at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee and the relevant Paying Agent an
Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount estimated to be so payable and
such other information necessary to enable the relevant Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts on the relevant payment date
(unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case
the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable after the date that is 30 days prior to the payment
date). The Trustee and the relevant Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely conclusively on such Officer’s Certificate as
conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.

Wherever in the Indenture, the Notes or this “Description of the Notes” there is mentioned, in any context:

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) redemption prices or purchase prices in connection with a redemption or purchase of the Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes or any Notes Guarantee,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context, Additional
Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will pay each applicable Holder for any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court or documentary taxes, or
similar charges or levies (including any related interest or penalties with respect thereto) or any other excise, property or similar
taxes or similar charges or levies (including any related interest or penalties with respect thereto) that arise in a Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction from the execution, issuance, delivery, registration, enforcement of, or receipt of payments with respect to any
Notes, any Notes Guarantee, the Indenture, or any other document or instrument in relation thereto (in each case, other than in
connection with a transfer of the Notes after this Offering) and limited, solely to the extent of such taxes or similar charges or
levies imposed in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction that arise from the receipt of any payments of principal or interest on the
Notes, to any such taxes or similar charges or levies that are not excluded under clauses (1) through (3) and (5) through (8) (for
purposes of this sentence, with clause (8) not including a reference to clause (4)) of the first paragraph under this section
captioned “—Withholding Taxes.”

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture, any transfer by a Holder or
beneficial owner, and will apply _mutatis mutandis_ to any jurisdiction in which any successor to a Payor is incorporated or
organized, engaged in business for tax purposes or otherwise resident for tax purposes, or any jurisdiction from or through
which any payment under, or with respect to the Notes (or any Notes Guarantee) is made by or on behalf of such Person, or
any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.

**Change of Control**

The Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control occurs, unless (i) a third party makes a change of control offer as
described herein or (ii) the Issuer has previously or substantially concurrently therewith delivered a redemption notice with
respect to all the outstanding Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption,” the Issuer will make an offer to purchase all
of the Notes (provided that Euro Notes of €100,000 or less and Dollar Notes of $200,000 or less may only be tendered and
repurchased in whole and not in part) pursuant to the offer described below (the “Change of Control Offer”) at a price in cash
equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to
but excluding the date of repurchase; provided that if the repurchase date is on or after the record date and on or before the
corresponding interest payment date, then Holders in whose name the Notes are registered at the close of business on such
record date will receive interest on the repurchase date. Within 60 days following any Change of Control, the Issuer will deliver
or cause to be delivered a notice of such Change of Control Offer electronically in accordance with the applicable procedures
of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder at the address of such
Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC, Euroclear and
Clearstream, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control and offering to repurchase the
Notes for the specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later
than the later of (x) 60 days from the date such notice is delivered and (y) the date of completion of the Change of Control,
pursuant to the procedures required by the Indenture and described in such notice, except in the case of a conditional Change
of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control as described below.

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws, rules or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act,
conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and
shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. The Issuer may rely on any
no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a
tender offer satisfies certain conditions.

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the
Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar
transaction.

The occurrence of events which would constitute a Change of Control may constitute mandatory prepayment events under the
Senior Credit Facilities or the Second Lien Credit Facilities and may trigger a change of control offer requirement under the
Existing Indentures and may ultimately permit holders of the Existing Notes or the lenders under the Senior Credit Facilities
and the Second Lien Credit Facilities to accelerate the maturity of borrowings thereunder. Furthermore, future Indebtedness of
the Parent or its Restricted Subsidiaries may contain prohibitions on certain events which would constitute a Change of Control
or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right
to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself
does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer.

The Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by its
then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required
repurchases. The Change of Control purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or
discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control purchase feature
is a result of negotiations between the initial purchasers of the Notes and us.

Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Issuer could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions,
refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could
increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings.
Restrictions on our ability to Incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens.” Such restrictions in the Indenture_
can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for
the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may
afford Holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if (i) a third party makes the
Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture
applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under
such Change of Control Offer or (ii) a notice of redemption of all outstanding Notes has been given pursuant to the Indenture
as described under “—Optional Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in the payment of the applicable redemption


-----

price on the applicable redemption date or the redemption is not consummated due to the failure of a condition precedent
contained in the applicable redemption notice to be satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of
Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control; _provided, however, that such Change of Control Offer is_
conditional upon such Change of Control.

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Parent and its
Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any Person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase
“substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of such phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain
circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all
_or substantially all” of the assets of the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear_
as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase
the Notes as described above.

The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a
Change of Control may be waived or modified with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes
then outstanding.

**IPO Pushdown**

On, in contemplation of, or following an IPO Event, the Parent shall be entitled to require (by written notice to the Trustee (a
“Pushdown Notice”)) that the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement) shall operate (with effect from the date specified in the relevant Pushdown Notice) on the basis that:

(1) references to the Parent and Restricted Subsidiaries (and all related provisions) shall apply only to the IPO
Pushdown Entity (as defined below) and its Restricted Subsidiaries from time to time;

(2) all financial ratio, basket calculations and financial definitions shall exclude any Parent Entity of the IPO
Pushdown Entity and, subject to the provisions of the covenant set forth under “Certain Covenants—
_Reports,” all reporting obligations shall be assumed at the level of the IPO Pushdown Entity;_

(3) each reference in the Indenture and/or the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement) to the “Parent” shall be deemed to be a reference to the IPO Pushdown Entity (to the extent
applicable and unless the context requires otherwise); provided that nothing in this paragraph, including the
deeming construct contemplated by this clause (3) and any action taken by the IPO Pushdown Entity prior to
it being deemed to be the Parent, shall, or shall be deemed to, directly or indirectly constitute or result in a
breach of any covenant or other term in the Indenture or a Default or an Event of Default;

(4) none of the representations, warranties, undertakings, covenants or Events of Default in the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) or the Security Documents shall apply
to any entity of which the IPO Pushdown Entity is a Subsidiary (whether in its capacity as a Guarantor in
respect of the Notes or otherwise);

(5) no event, matter or circumstance relating to any Parent Entity of the IPO Pushdown Entity (whether in its
capacity as a Guarantor in respect of the Notes or otherwise) shall, or shall be deemed to, directly or indirectly
constitute or result in a breach of any covenant or other term in the Indenture or a Default or an Event of
Default;

(6) each Parent Entity of the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be irrevocably and unconditionally released from all
obligations under the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) and
any security granted by any such Parent Entity (subject to clause (1) above);

(7) unless otherwise notified by the Parent: (a) each person which is party to the Intercreditor Agreement (or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as a “Subordinated Creditor” (as such term is defined in the Intercreditor
Agreement) shall be irrevocably and unconditionally released from the Intercreditor Agreement (or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement) and all obligations and restrictions under the Intercreditor Agreement
or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (and from the date specified by the Parent that Person shall cease
to be party to the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as a Subordinated
Creditor and shall have no further rights or obligations under the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement) as a Subordinated Creditor); and (b) there shall be no obligation or requirement for


-----

any Person to become party to the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as a
Subordinated Creditor; and

(8) in the event that any Person is released from or does not become party to the Intercreditor Agreement (or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as a Subordinated Creditor as a consequence of this first paragraph, any
term of the Indenture and/or the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) which
requires or assumes that any Person be a Subordinated Creditor or that any liabilities or obligations to such
Person be subject to the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) or otherwise
subordinated shall cease to apply.

A Pushdown Notice may not be delivered if a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (disregarding any
Default or Event of Default that could be deemed to arise in connection with the transactions contemplated by this provision).

The Trustee and the Security Agent, as applicable, shall be required to enter into any amendment to the Indenture or amendment
to or replacement of the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) or the Security Documents, as
applicable, required by the Parent in writing and/or take such other action as is required by the Parent in order to facilitate or
reflect any of the matters contemplated by the first paragraph of this covenant (the “IPO Pushdown”); _provided_ that such
amendment, replacement or other document or instrument does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or the
Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or the Security Agent, does not affect the rights, duties, liabilities,
indemnification or immunities of the Trustee or the Security Agent under such amendment replacement or other document or
instrument. The Trustee, the Security Agent and any other agents party thereto are each irrevocably authorized and instructed
by the Holders (without any consent by the Holders) to execute any such amended or replacement documents and/or take other
such action on behalf of the Holders (and shall do so on the request of and at the cost of the Parent).

For the purpose of this covenant, the “IPO Pushdown Entity” shall be any Restricted Subsidiary notified to the Trustee by the
Parent in writing as the Person to be treated as the IPO Pushdown Entity in relation to the relevant IPO Event; _provided that_
(a) the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be a Restricted Subsidiary which will issue shares, or whose shares are to be sold, pursuant
to that IPO Event (or a Parent Entity of such member of the Group); (b) the Issuer shall become a Restricted Subsidiary of the
IPO Pushdown Entity and references to the Issuer shall be deemed to be references to the new Issuer designated by the Parent;
_provided that in no circumstance shall the Issuer be organized in a jurisdiction other than a Permissible Company Jurisdiction;_
and (c) the Parent may not designate as the IPO Pushdown Entity any entity which is not a direct or indirect Parent Entity of
the Restricted Subsidiaries constituting all or substantially all of the Group’s assets.

If the Parent delivers a Pushdown Notice to the Trustee pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant in relation to a
contemplated IPO Event, it shall be entitled to revoke that Pushdown Notice at any time prior to the occurrence of the relevant
IPO Event by written notice to the Trustee. In the event that any Pushdown Notice is revoked in accordance with this paragraph:
(a) the provisions of clauses (1) to (8) of the first paragraph of this covenant shall cease to apply in relation to that Pushdown
Notice; (b) if any security has been released pursuant to first paragraph of this covenant in reliance on that Pushdown Notice,
subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Parent or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary shall as soon as reasonably practicable
execute a replacement Security Document in respect of that security; and (c) if any Person party to the Intercreditor Agreement
(or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as a “Subordinated Creditor” has been released from the Intercreditor Agreement
(or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) pursuant to clause (7) of the first paragraph of this covenant in reliance on that
Pushdown Notice, that Person shall as soon as reasonably practicable accede to the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement) as a Subordinated Creditor.

For the avoidance of doubt: (a) nothing in the immediately preceding paragraph shall prohibit or otherwise restrict the Parent
from delivering a further Pushdown Notice in relation to any actual or contemplated IPO Event; and (b) revocation of a
Pushdown Notice will not, and will not be deemed to, directly or indirectly constitute or result in a breach of any representation,
warranty, undertaking or other term in the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement)
or a Default or an Event of Default (whether by reason of any action or step taken by any Person, or any matter or circumstance
arising or committed, while that Pushdown Notice was effective or otherwise).

**Certain Covenants**

Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants that will be contained in the Indenture. For the avoidance of doubt, the
consummation of the Transactions shall not be prohibited by the covenants below.


-----

**_Limitation on Indebtedness_**

The Parent will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Indebtedness (including Acquired
Indebtedness); provided, however, that the Parent, the Issuer and any Guarantor may Incur Indebtedness (including Acquired
Indebtedness), if on the date of such Incurrence and after giving pro forma effect thereto (including pro forma application of
the proceeds thereof), the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio for the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries for the Relevant
Testing Period immediately preceding the date on which such additional Indebtedness is Incurred would have been equal to or
less than 5.00 to 1.00.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following Indebtedness:

(1) Indebtedness Incurred by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to any Credit Facility (including
in respect of letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances issued or created thereunder) and any Refinancing
Indebtedness in respect thereof and Guarantees in respect of such Indebtedness in a maximum aggregate
principal amount of Indebtedness then outstanding not exceeding the sum of: (a) €4,300.0 million; and (b) an
amount equal to the greater of €560.0 million and 4.3% of Total Assets; plus, in the case of any refinancing
of any Indebtedness permitted under this clause (1) or any portion thereof, the aggregate amount of fees,
underwriting discounts, premia (including tender premia) and other costs and expenses Incurred in
connection with such refinancing;

(2) (a) Guarantees by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness of the Parent or any Restricted
Subsidiary, in each case, so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness being guaranteed is permitted under
the terms of the Indenture (other than pursuant to this clause (2)); _provided that_ (x) if Indebtedness being
guaranteed is subordinated to or pari passu with the Notes or the Guarantees granted in respect thereof, then
the guarantee must be subordinated to, or _pari passu with, the Notes or the Guarantees granted in respect_
thereof, as applicable, to the same extent as the Indebtedness guaranteed, and (y) any Indebtedness Incurred
pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, clause (4)(d) below (with respect to Refinancing Indebtedness
of Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant only) and clause (11) below may
only be guaranteed by the Parent, the Issuer or any Guarantor (including a Restricted Subsidiary that becomes
a Guarantor substantially concurrently with its Guaranteeing such Indebtedness pursuant to this clause); or

(b) without limiting the covenant described under “—Limitation on Liens,” Indebtedness arising by reason of
any Lien granted by or applicable to such Person securing Indebtedness of the Parent or any Restricted
Subsidiary, in each case, so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness is permitted under the terms of the
Indenture;

(3) Indebtedness of the Parent owing to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary or Indebtedness of a Restricted
Subsidiary owing to and held by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary; provided, however, that:

(a) other than in respect of intercompany current liabilities Incurred in connection with credit management,

cash management, cash pooling, netting, setting off or similar arrangements in the ordinary course of
business or consistent with past practice of the Parent and the Restricted Subsidiaries (including Cash
Management Services), if the Parent, the Issuer or any Guarantor is the obligor of such Indebtedness and
the payee is not the Parent, the Issuer or any Guarantor, such Indebtedness must be unsecured and
expressly subordinated to the prior payment in full in cash of all obligations then due (x) in the case of
the Issuer, with respect to the Notes, or (y) in the case of a Guarantor, with respect to its Notes Guarantee,
in each case pursuant to its own terms or as provided in the Intercreditor Agreement; and

(b) (1) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Capital Stock or any other event which results in any such

Indebtedness being beneficially held by a Person other than the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary; and
(2) any sale or other transfer of any such Indebtedness to a Person other than the Parent or a Restricted
Subsidiary, shall be deemed, in each case, to constitute an Incurrence of such Indebtedness not permitted
by this clause (3) by the Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be;

(4) Indebtedness represented by (a) the Notes (other than any Additional Notes), including any Notes
Guarantees, (b) Indebtedness Incurred on or about the Issue Date under the Tranche E Term Facilities under
the Senior Credit Facilities, (c) any Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facilities)
of the Parent and the Restricted Subsidiaries entered into or outstanding on the Issue Date (after giving effect
to the Transactions and the application of proceeds therefrom), (d) Refinancing Indebtedness Incurred in
respect of any Indebtedness described in this clause (4) or in clause (5) below or Incurred pursuant to the first


-----

paragraph of this covenant, (e) Management Advances, or (f)(i) proceeds loans and (ii) any “parallel debt”
obligations, in each case, related to any Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred pursuant to the Indenture;

(5) Indebtedness (x) of any Person (or secured by any assets of such Person) outstanding on the date on which
such Person becomes a Restricted Subsidiary or is merged, consolidated, amalgamated or otherwise
combined with (including pursuant to any acquisition of assets and assumption of related liabilities) the
Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary; or (y) Incurred by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary (including a
Person that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such acquisition) to provide or refinance all or any
portion of the funds utilized to consummate a transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which
assets are acquired by the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary or a Person that became a Restricted Subsidiary
or was otherwise acquired by the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary or otherwise in connection with or in
contemplation of such acquisition; _provided, however, that with respect to sub-clauses (5)(x) and (5)(y)_
above, at the time of such acquisition or other transaction (i) the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries would
have been permitted to Incur €1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant
after giving pro forma effect to the relevant acquisition and Incurrence of such Indebtedness pursuant to this
clause (5) or (ii) the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio of the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries would not
be higher than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such acquisition or other transaction;

(6) Indebtedness under Hedging Agreements entered into for _bona fide hedging purposes of the Parent or its_
Restricted Subsidiaries and not for speculative purposes (as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors or an Officer of the Parent);

(7) Indebtedness consisting of:

(a) Capitalized Lease Obligations, mortgage or other real estate financings, Purchase Money Obligations or

other financings, in each case, Incurred for the purpose of financing all or any part of the purchase price
or cost of construction or improvement of property, plant or equipment used in a Similar Business;

(b) Indebtedness otherwise Incurred to finance the purchase, lease, rental or cost of design, construction,

installation or improvement of property (real or personal) or equipment that is used or useful in a Similar
Business, whether through the direct purchase of assets or the Capital Stock of any Person owning such
assets; and

(c) any Refinancing Indebtedness and Guarantees in respect of sub-clauses (7)(a) and (7)(b) above;

in an aggregate outstanding principal amount which, when taken together with the principal amount of all
other Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (7) then outstanding, will not exceed the greater of
€235.0 million and 1.8% of Total Assets;

(8) Indebtedness in respect of (a) workers’ compensation claims, self-insurance obligations, customer
guarantees, performance, indemnity, surety, judgment, appeal, advance payment, customs, VAT or other tax
or other guarantees or other similar bonds, instruments or obligations and completion guarantees and
warranties provided by the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary or relating to liabilities, obligations, indemnities
or guarantees Incurred in the ordinary course of business or for governmental or regulatory requirements;
(b) letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances, guarantees or other similar instruments or obligations issued or
relating to liabilities or obligations Incurred in the ordinary course of business; provided, however, that upon
the drawing of such letters of credit or other instrument, such obligations are reimbursed within thirty
(30) days following such drawing; (c) the financing of insurance premia in the ordinary course of business;
and (d) Cash Management Services and any credit management, cash management, cash pooling, netting,
setting off or similar arrangements in the ordinary course of business of the Parent and the Restricted
Subsidiaries;

(9) Indebtedness arising from agreements providing for customary guarantees, indemnification, obligations in
respect of earn-outs or other adjustments of purchase price or, in each case, similar obligations, in each case,
Incurred or assumed in connection with the acquisition or disposition of any business or assets or Person or
any Capital Stock of a Subsidiary (other than Guarantees of Indebtedness Incurred by any Person acquiring
or disposing of such business or assets or such Subsidiary for the purpose of financing such acquisition or
disposition);


-----

(10) (a) Indebtedness arising from the honoring by a bank or other financial institution of a check, draft or similar
instrument drawn against insufficient funds in the ordinary course of business; provided, however, that such
Indebtedness is extinguished within sixty (60) Business Days of Incurrence; (b) Indebtedness owed on a
short-term basis of no longer than sixty (60) days to banks and other financial institutions Incurred in the
ordinary course of business of the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries with such banks or financial
institutions that arises in connection with ordinary banking arrangements to manage cash balances of the
Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries; and (c) Indebtedness Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary in connection
with bankers’ acceptances, discounted bills of exchange or the discounting or factoring of receivables for

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular Indebtedness Incurred
pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant:

(1) in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness described in
the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, the Parent, in its sole discretion, will classify, and may from
time to time reclassify, such item (or any portion of such item) of Indebtedness and only be required to
include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in one of the clauses of the second paragraph or the first
paragraph of this covenant; provided that any Indebtedness Incurred under the Senior Credit Facilities and
outstanding as of the Issue Date (other than Indebtedness under the Tranche E Term Facilities) and
Indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facilities and the Letter of Credit Facilities up to the committed
amounts thereunder as of the Issue Date shall be deemed to be incurred under sub-clause (1)(a) of the
preceding paragraph and shall not be reclassified; provided further that any Indebtedness Incurred pursuant
to clauses (7), (11), (14), (15) and (16) of the second paragraph of this covenant shall cease to be deemed
Incurred or outstanding pursuant to such clauses (7), (11), (14), (15) and (16), as applicable, but shall be
deemed Incurred and outstanding pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant from and after the first date
on which the Parent, the Issuer or any Guarantor, as the case may be, could have Incurred such Indebtedness
thereunder (to the extent the Parent, the Issuer or any Guarantor is able to Incur any Liens related to such
Indebtedness as Permitted Liens or Permitted Collateral Liens after such reclassification);

(2) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments
relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the determination of a particular
amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;

(3) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are Incurred
pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to clauses (1), (7) or (11) of the
second paragraph of this covenant or pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, and the letters of credit,
bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness
shall not be included;

(4) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred Stock
of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption or repurchase
price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the liquidation preference
thereof;

(5) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision permitting
such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or more other
provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness; and

(6) the amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date shall be calculated as described under the
definition of “Indebtedness,” provided that the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the
principal amount thereof will be equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis
of Accounting Principles.

Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount,
the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the form of additional shares of
Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to
a change in Accounting Principles will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of this “Limitation on
_Indebtedness” covenant._

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary shall be deemed
to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date.

For purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the Euro
Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another currency shall be calculated based on
the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or,
at the option of the Parent, first committed or first Incurred, in the case of Indebtedness Incurred under a revolving credit
facility; provided that (i) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than


-----

euro, and such refinancing would cause the applicable euro denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant
currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such euro denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have
been exceeded so long as the aggregate principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the aggregate
principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced; (ii) the Euro Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of any such
Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the
Issue Date and (iii) if and for so long as any such Indebtedness is subject to a Currency Agreement with respect to the currency
in which such Indebtedness is denominated covering principal amounts payable on such Indebtedness, the amount of such
Indebtedness, if denominated in euro, will be the amount of the principal payment required to be made under such Currency
Agreement and, otherwise, the Euro Equivalent of such amount plus the Euro Equivalent of any premium which is at such time
due and payable but is not covered by such Currency Agreement.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Parent or a Restricted
Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the
exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in
a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable
to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

advances made to the relevant Holding Company to fund interest payments in respect of Indebtedness
of such Holding Company;

(2) purchase, redeem, retire or otherwise acquire for value any Capital Stock of the Parent or any direct or indirect
Holding Company of the Parent held by Persons other than the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary (other than

Restricted Payment or Investment (or, in each case, portion thereof) in any manner that complies with this covenant, including
in each case as an Investment pursuant to one or more of the clauses contained in the definition of “Permitted Investments,”

The Parent will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create, Incur or suffer to exist any
Lien upon any of its property or assets (including Capital Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary), whether owned on the Issue Date
or acquired after that date, or any interest therein or any income or profits therefrom, which Lien is securing any Indebtedness
(such Lien, the “Initial Lien”), except (a) in the case of any property or asset that does not constitute Collateral, (i) Permitted
Liens or (ii) Liens on property or assets that are not Permitted Liens if the Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the Indenture are
directly secured, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, equally and ratably with, or prior to, in the case of Liens with respect
to Subordinated Indebtedness, the Indebtedness secured by such Initial Lien for so long as such Indebtedness is so secured, and
(b) in the case of any property or assets that constitute Collateral, Permitted Collateral Liens.

Any such Lien created in favor of the Notes under sub-clause (a)(ii) in the immediately preceding paragraph will be
automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon (a) the release and discharge of the Initial Lien to which it
relates and (b) otherwise as set forth under “—Security—Release of Liens.”

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted pursuant to the first paragraph of this “Liens” covenant to
secure such Indebtedness at the time of the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any
Increased Amount of such Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount
of such Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the amortization of original
issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms, accretion of original issue
discount or liquidation preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in
the exchange rate of currencies or increases in the value of property securing such Indebtedness.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Indenture, no property or asset of Midco, the Parent, or any Restricted
Subsidiary that is subject to a floating charge only (and not to any other Lien) under any Security Document shall be deemed
Collateral for purposes of determining whether a Permitted Lien is permitted over such asset or property pursuant to the
covenant under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens” for so long as such floating charge has not crystallized into a
fixed charge.

**_Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Parent will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to create or otherwise cause or permit to exist or become
effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to:

(A) pay dividends or make any other distributions in cash or otherwise on its Capital Stock to the Parent or the
Issuer or pay any Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the Parent or the Issuer;

(B) make any loans or advances to the Parent or the Issuer; or

(C) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to the Parent or the Issuer;


-----

_provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior to dividends or_
liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination of (including the application of any standstill
requirements to) loans or advances made to the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness Incurred by the Parent
or any Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed to constitute such an encumbrance or restriction.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:

(1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (a) the Indenture, (b) the Existing Indentures, (c) any Credit
Facility as in effect on the Issue Date (including the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement and the Second Lien
Credit Facilities Agreement), after giving effect to the Transactions, (d) the Intercreditor Agreement, (e) the
Security Documents or (f) any other agreement or instrument in effect at or entered into on the Issue Date,
after giving effect to the Transactions, including, in the case of each of sub-clauses (1)(a) to (1)(f), any
amendments, restatements, modifications, renewals, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings,
_provided that the amendments, restatements, modifications, renewals, supplements, refundings, replacements_
or refinancings are not materially more restrictive, taken as a whole, with respect to such dividend and other
payment restrictions than those contained in those agreements referred to in sub-clauses (1)(a) to (1)(f) above,
as applicable (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Parent);

(2) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument of a Person or relating to any Capital
Stock or Indebtedness of a Person, entered into on or before the date on which such Person was acquired by
or merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary, or was
designated as a Restricted Subsidiary or on which such agreement or instrument is assumed by the Parent or
any Restricted Subsidiary in connection with an acquisition of assets (other than Capital Stock or
Indebtedness Incurred as consideration in, or to provide all or any portion of the funds utilized to
consummate, the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which such Person became a
Restricted Subsidiary or was acquired by the Parent or was merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with
or into the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary entered into or in connection with such transaction) and
outstanding on such date; provided that, for the purposes of this clause (2), if another Person is the Successor
Company, any Subsidiary thereof or agreement or instrument of such Person or any such Subsidiary shall be
deemed acquired or assumed by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary when such Person becomes the
Successor Company;

(3) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument effecting a refinancing of
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to, or that otherwise refinances, an agreement or instrument referred to in
clauses (1) and (2) above or in this clause (3) (an “Initial Agreement”) or contained in any amendment,
supplement or other modification to an agreement referred to in clauses (1) and (2) above or in this clause
(3); provided, however, that the encumbrances and restrictions with respect to such Restricted Subsidiary
contained in any such agreement or instrument are no less favorable in any material respect to the Holders
taken as a whole than the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Initial Agreement or Initial
Agreements to which such refinancing or amendment, supplement or other modification relates (as
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Parent);

(4) any encumbrance or restriction:

(a) that restricts in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any property or asset that is

subject to a lease, license or similar contract, or the assignment or transfer of any lease, license or other
contract;

(b) contained in mortgages, pledges, charges or other security agreements permitted under the Indenture or

securing Indebtedness of the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary permitted under the Indenture to the extent
such encumbrances or restrictions restrict the transfer of the property or assets subject to such mortgages,
pledges, charges or other security agreements; or

(c) pursuant to customary provisions restricting dispositions of real property interests set forth in any

reciprocal easement agreements of the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Purchase Money Obligations and Capitalized Lease Obligations
permitted under the Indenture, in each case, that impose encumbrances or restrictions on the property so
acquired or any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to a joint venture agreement that imposes restrictions on
the transfer of the assets or Capital Stock of the joint venture;


-----

(6) any encumbrance or restriction with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary (or any of its properties or assets)
imposed pursuant to an agreement entered into for the direct or indirect sale or disposition to a Person of all
or substantially all the Capital Stock or assets of such Restricted Subsidiary (or the properties or assets that
are subject to such restriction) pending the closing of such sale or disposition;

(7) customary provisions in leases, licenses, joint venture agreements and other similar agreements and
instruments entered into in the ordinary course of business;

(8) encumbrances or restrictions arising or existing by reason of applicable law or any applicable rule, regulation
or order (including encumbrances or restrictions to make distributions in cash or Cash Equivalents as a
dividend or otherwise that arise or exist by reason of applicable law or any applicable rule, regulation or
order) or encumbrances or restrictions required by any regulatory authority;

(9) any encumbrance or restriction on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers under
agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business;

(10) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Hedging Agreements;

(11) any encumbrance or restriction arising pursuant to an agreement or instrument (a) relating to any
Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the provisions of the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” if the encumbrances and restrictions contained in any such
agreement or instrument taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Holders (taken as a whole)
than (i) in the opinion of the Parent, the encumbrances and restrictions contained in (A) the Indenture, the
Existing Indentures, the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement or the Second Lien Credit Facilities Agreement,
together with the Security Documents associated therewith or (B) the Intercreditor Agreement, in each case
as in effect on the Issue Date or (ii) in comparable financings (as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors or an Officer of the Parent) and where, in the case of this sub-clause (ii), the Parent determines at
the time such Indebtedness is Incurred that such encumbrances or restrictions will not adversely affect, in
any material respect, the Parent’s ability to make principal or interest payments on the Notes, or
(b) constituting an Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(12) any encumbrance or restriction existing by reason of any Lien permitted under “—Limitation on Liens”;

(13) restrictions effected in connection with a Qualified Receivables Financing that, in the good faith
determination of the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Parent, are necessary or advisable to effect such
Qualified Receivables Financing;

(14) provisions restricting assignment of any agreement entered into in the ordinary course of business or
consistent with past practice;

(15) customary restrictions included in shareholder agreements, including, without limitation, those relating to
non-Wholly Owned Subsidiaries; or

(16) any encumbrance or restriction arising under the Sale and Purchase Agreement or otherwise arising from or
existing by reason of the Transactions.

**_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock_**

The Parent will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any Asset Disposition unless:

(1) the Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration (including by way of
relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise) at
least equal to the fair market value (such fair market value to be determined on the date of contractually
agreeing to such Asset Disposition) of the shares and assets subject to such Asset Disposition (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, if such Asset Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap); and

(2) in any such Asset Disposition, or series of related Asset Dispositions (except to the extent the Asset
Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap), at least 75% of the consideration from such Asset Disposition
(excluding any consideration by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any


-----

liabilities, contingent or otherwise, other than Indebtedness) received by the Parent or such Restricted
Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form of cash, Cash Equivalents or Temporary Cash Investments.

In relation to any Asset Disposition, within three hundred and sixty five (365) days from the later of (i) the date of such Asset
Disposition; and (ii) the receipt of any Net Available Cash as proceeds from such Asset Disposition, the Parent or such
Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, may apply an amount equal to such Net Available Cash at the option of the Parent
or such Restricted Subsidiary:

(1) (a) to prepay, repay, purchase or redeem (including through open market purchases, voluntary tender offers
or privately negotiated transactions at market prices) any Senior Secured Indebtedness (including
Indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facilities); provided, however, that in connection with any prepayment,
repayment, purchase or redemption of Indebtedness pursuant to this sub-clause (1)(a) (except in the case of
any revolving Indebtedness, including but not limited to any revolving credit facilities under the Senior Credit
Facilities Agreement), the Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary will retire such Indebtedness and will cause
the related commitment to be permanently reduced in an amount equal to the principal amount so prepaid,
repaid, purchased or redeemed; provided further, however, that in the case of the prepayment, repayment,
purchase or redemption of Senior Secured Indebtedness that is Public Debt (other than any Existing Notes
that remain outstanding after giving effect to the Transactions and the application of proceeds therefrom), the
Issuer makes an offer to the Holders to purchase their Notes in accordance with the provisions set forth below
for an Asset Disposition Offer for an aggregate principal amount of Notes at least equal to the proportion that
(x) the total aggregate principal amount of Notes outstanding bears to (y) the sum of the total aggregate
principal amount of Notes outstanding plus the total aggregate principal amount outstanding of such Senior
Secured Indebtedness that is Public Debt and is being prepaid, repaid, purchased or redeemed;

(b) to prepay, repay, purchase or redeem (including through open market purchases, voluntary tender offers
or privately negotiated transactions at market prices) any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not
the Issuer or a Guarantor (other than Indebtedness owed to the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary); or

(c) in the case of an Asset Disposition that does not constitute Collateral, to prepay, repay, purchase or redeem

(I) Pari Passu Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness owed to the Parent or a Restricted
Subsidiary) (i) at a price of no more than 100% of the principal amount of such Pari Passu
Indebtedness plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of such prepayment, repayment, purchase
or redemption, (ii) through repurchase of such Pari Passu Indebtedness in the open market or
(iii) pursuant to the contractual optional redemption or voluntary prepayment provisions applicable
thereto, or

(II) Senior Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness owed to the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary) (i)
at a price of no more than 100% of the principal amount of such Senior Indebtedness plus accrued
and unpaid interest to the date of such prepayment, repayment, purchase or redemption, (ii) through
repurchase of such Senior Indebtedness in the open market or (iii) pursuant to the contractual
optional redemption or voluntary prepayment provisions applicable thereto; _provided_ that in the
case of the prepayment, repayment, purchase or redemption of Senior Indebtedness that is Public
Debt pursuant to this sub-clause (1)(a)(c)(II), the Issuer makes an offer to the Holders to purchase
their Notes in accordance with the provisions set forth below for an Asset Disposition Offer for an
aggregate principal amount of Notes at least equal to the proportion that (x) the total aggregate
principal amount of Notes outstanding bears to (y) the sum of the total aggregate principal amount
of Notes outstanding _plus_ the total aggregate principal amount outstanding of such Senior
Indebtedness that is being prepaid, repaid, purchased or redeemed;

(2) to the extent the Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary elects, to invest in or commit to invest in Additional
Assets (including by means of an investment in Additional Assets by a Restricted Subsidiary with Net
Available Cash received by the Parent or another Restricted Subsidiary) within three hundred and sixty five
(365) days from the later of: (a) the date of such Asset Disposition; and (b) the receipt of such Net Available
Cash; provided, however, that any such investment in Additional Assets made pursuant to a definitive binding
agreement or a commitment approved by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Parent that is executed
or approved within such time will satisfy this requirement, so long as such investment is consummated within
one hundred and eighty (180) days of such 365th day;


-----

(3) to make a capital expenditure within three hundred and sixty five (365) days from the later of: (a) the date of
such Asset Disposition; and (b) the receipt of such Net Available Cash; provided, however, that any such
capital expenditure made pursuant to a definitive binding agreement or a commitment approved by the Board
of Directors or an Officer of the Parent that is executed or approved within such time will satisfy this
requirement, so long as such capital expenditure is consummated within one hundred and eighty (180) days
of such 365th day; or

(4) any combination of the foregoing,

_provided that, pending the final application of any such Net Available Cash in accordance with clauses (1), (2), (3) or (4) above,_
the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily reduce Indebtedness or otherwise use such Net Available Cash in
any manner not prohibited by the Indenture.

If an amount less than the Net Available Cash from Asset Dispositions is applied or invested or committed to be applied or
invested, or offered to be applied or invested, as provided in the preceding paragraph, an amount equal to the difference will
be deemed to constitute “Excess Proceeds” under the Indenture. On the 366th day (or the 546th day, in the case of any Net
Available Cash committed to be used pursuant to a definitive binding agreement or commitment approved by the Board of
Directors or an Officer of the Parent pursuant to clauses (2) or (3) of the second paragraph of this covenant) after the later of:
(i) the date of an Asset Disposition; and (ii) the receipt of such Net Available Cash from an Asset Disposition, or at such earlier
date as the Parent elects, if the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds under the Indenture exceeds €75.0 million, the Issuer will
within ten Business Days be required to make an offer (“Asset Disposition Offer”) to all Holders of Notes issued under the
Indenture and, to the extent the Issuer elects, to all holders of other outstanding Senior Secured Indebtedness or, with respect
to Net Available Cash from Asset Dispositions that do not constitute Collateral, Pari Passu Indebtedness or Senior Indebtedness,
as applicable, to purchase the maximum principal amount of Notes and to repay, prepay or purchase any such Senior Secured
Indebtedness, Pari Passu Indebtedness or Senior Indebtedness, as applicable, to which the Asset Disposition Offer applies that
may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in respect of the Notes in an amount equal to 100% of the
principal amount of the Notes and not more than 100% of the principal amount of such Senior Secured Indebtedness, Pari Passu
Indebtedness or Senior Indebtedness, as applicable, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including,
the date of repayment, prepayment or purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture or the agreements
governing such Senior Secured Indebtedness, Pari Passu Indebtedness or Senior Indebtedness, as applicable, and which may
include, in the case of such Senior Secured Indebtedness, Pari Passu Indebtedness or Senior Indebtedness, as applicable, such
higher price as may be contemplated by the agreement governing such Indebtedness, and in minimum denomination of
$200,000 in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof with respect to the Dollar Notes and in minimum denominations of
€100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof with respect to the Euro Notes. The Issuer will deliver notice of
such Asset Disposition Offer electronically or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, the relevant Paying Agent and
each Holder at the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the Applicable
Procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Asset Disposition
and offering to repurchase the Notes for the specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no
earlier than 10 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the
Indenture and described in such notice. The Issuer may satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to any Net Available Cash
from an Asset Disposition by making an Asset Disposition Offer with respect to all Net Available Cash prior to the expiration
of the relevant 365 days (or such longer period provided above) (the “Asset Disposition Offer Period”) or with respect to any
unapplied Excess Proceeds.

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and Senior Secured Indebtedness, Pari Passu Indebtedness or Senior
Indebtedness, as applicable, so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than
the Excess Proceeds, the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for any purpose not
prohibited by the Indenture and its obligation to make an Asset Disposition Offer from such remaining Excess Proceeds shall
be deemed discharged. If the aggregate principal amount of the Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by Holders
and other Senior Secured Indebtedness, Pari Passu Indebtedness or Senior Indebtedness, as applicable, surrendered by holders
or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Issuer shall allocate the Excess Proceeds among the Notes
and such Indebtedness to be repaid, prepaid or purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of
tendered Notes and such Indebtedness.

For the purposes of calculating the principal amount of any such indebtedness not denominated in Euro, such Indebtedness
shall be calculated by converting any such principal amount into its Euro Equivalent amount determined as of a date selected
by the Issuer that is within the Asset Disposition Offer Period. Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of
Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero (regardless of whether there are any remaining Excess Proceeds upon such completion).
Additionally, the Issuer may, at its option, make an Asset Disposition Offer using proceeds from any Asset Disposition at any


-----

time after the consummation of such Asset Disposition. Upon consummation or expiration of any Asset Disposition Offer, any
remaining Net Available Cash shall not be deemed Excess Proceeds and the Issuer may use such Net Available Cash for any
purpose not prohibited by the Indenture.

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Notes is denominated in a currency other than
euro, the amount thereof payable in respect of the Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in euro that is actually received
by the Issuer upon converting such portion into euro.

For the purposes of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the following will be deemed to be cash consideration:

(1) the assumption by the transferee of Indebtedness or other liabilities, contingent or otherwise of the Parent or
a Restricted Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor) and the release
of the Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary from all liability on such Indebtedness in connection with such
Asset Disposition;

(2) securities, notes or other obligations received by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary from the transferee
that are converted by the Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents within one
hundred and eighty (180) days following the closing of such Asset Disposition;

(3) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset
Disposition, to the extent that the Parent and each other Restricted Subsidiary are released from any
Guarantee of payment of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition;

(4) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than Subordinated
Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor) received after the Issue Date from Persons who are not the Parent
or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset
Dispositions having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated Non-Cash
Consideration received pursuant to this covenant that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of
€100.0 million and 0.75% of Total Assets (with the fair market value of each item of Designated Non-Cash
Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value);
and

(6) any combination of the consideration specified in the preceding clauses (1) through (5).

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, conflict
with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws, rules and regulations and shall
not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof.

Notwithstanding any other provision in the Indenture to the contrary, the provisions of the Indenture relative to the Issuer’s
obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of an Asset Disposition may be waived or modified with the
consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.

The Senior Credit Facilities Agreement and the Second Lien Credit Facilities Agreement may prohibit or limit, and future
credit agreements or other agreements to which the Issuer becomes a party may prohibit or limit, the Issuer from purchasing
any Notes pursuant to this covenant. In the event the Issuer is prohibited from purchasing the Notes, the Issuer could seek the
consent of its lenders to the purchase of the Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition.
If the Issuer does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, it will remain prohibited from purchasing the Notes. In
such case, the Issuer’s failure to purchase tendered Notes would constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture.

**_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_**

The Parent will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, enter into or conduct any
transaction or series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any property or the rendering of
any service) with or for the benefit of any Affiliate of the Parent (such transaction or series of related transactions being an
“Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate value in excess of the greater of €15.0 million and 0.1% of Total Assets unless:

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Parent or such
Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a comparable transaction at


-----

the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement providing for such transaction in arm’s length
dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate; and

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of the greater of €45.0 million
and 0.35% of Total Assets, the terms of such transaction or series of related transactions have been approved
by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the Parent resolving that such transaction complies
with clause (1) above.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to:

(1) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Restricted Payments,” any Permitted Payments (other than pursuant to sub-clause (9)(b)(y) of the second_
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”) or any Permitted
Investment;

(2) any issuance or sale of Capital Stock, options, other equity related interests or other securities, or other
payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to, or the funding of, or entering into, or
maintenance of, any employment, consulting, collective bargaining or benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement, related trust or other similar agreement and other compensation arrangements, options, warrants
or other rights to purchase Capital Stock of the Parent, any Restricted Subsidiary or any Holding Company,
restricted stock plans, long term incentive plans, stock appreciation rights plans, participation plans or similar
employee benefits or consultants’ plans (including valuation, health, insurance, deferred compensation,
severance, retirement, savings or similar plans, programs or arrangements) or indemnities provided on behalf
of officers, employees, directors or consultants approved by the Board of Directors of the Parent, in each case
in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice;

(3) the entering into any agreement to pay and the payment of any Management Advances (including any waiver
or transaction with respect thereto) and the payment of any fees and expenses related to the Transactions;

(4) any transaction between or among the Parent and any Restricted Subsidiary (or entity that becomes a
Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction), or between or among Restricted Subsidiaries or any
Receivables Subsidiary;

(5) the payment of reasonable fees and reimbursement of expenses to, and customary indemnities (including
under customary insurance policies) and employee benefit and pension expenses provided on behalf of,
directors, officers, consultants or employees of the Parent, any Restricted Subsidiary or any Holding
Company (whether directly or indirectly and including through any Person owned or controlled by any of
such directors, officers or employees);

(6) the Transactions and the entry into and performance of obligations of the Parent or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries under the terms of any transaction arising out of, and any payments pursuant to or for purposes
of funding, any agreement or instrument in effect as of or on the Issue Date or entered into in connection
with the Transactions, as these agreements and instruments may be amended, modified, supplemented,
extended, renewed or refinanced from time to time in accordance with the other terms of this covenant or to
the extent not more disadvantageous to the Holders in any material respect in the good faith judgment of the
Board of Directors or an Officer of the Parent and the entry into and performance of any registration rights
or other listing agreement in connection with any Public Offering;

(7) the execution, delivery and performance of any Tax Sharing Agreement and the formation and maintenance
of any consolidated group for tax, accounting or cash pooling or management purposes in the ordinary course
of business or consistent with past practice;

(8) transactions with customers, clients, landlords, suppliers or purchasers or sellers of goods or services, which,
in each case, are in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice and are either fair to the
Parent or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary in the reasonable determination of the Board of Directors or an
Officer of the Parent or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary or are on terms no less favorable than those that
could reasonably have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated party;

(9) any transaction in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice between or among the
Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary and any Affiliate of the Parent or an Associate or similar entity that would


-----

constitute an Affiliate Transaction solely because the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of the
Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of any Permitted Investor owns an equity interest in or
otherwise controls such Affiliate, Associate or similar entity;

(10) (a) issuances or sales of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated Preference Shares) of the
Parent or options, warrants or other rights to acquire such Capital Stock or Subordinated Shareholder
Funding; provided that the interest rate and other financial terms of such Subordinated Shareholder Funding
are approved by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Parent in their
reasonable determination and (b) any amendment, waiver or other transaction with respect to any
Subordinated Shareholder Funding in compliance with the other provisions of the Indenture, the Intercreditor
Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, as applicable;

(11) without duplication in respect of payments made pursuant to clause (12) below: (a) payments by the Parent
or any Restricted Subsidiary to any Permitted Investor (whether directly or indirectly, including through any
Holding Company) of annual management, consulting, monitoring or advisory fees and related expenses in
an aggregate amount not to exceed €7.0 million in each twelve (12) month period that has commenced since
the Issue Date (with unused amounts in each such twelve month period being carried over to the succeeding
twelve month period) and (b) customary payments by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary to any
Permitted Investor (whether directly or indirectly, including through any Holding Company) for financial
advisory, financing, underwriting or placement services or in respect of other investment banking activities,
including in connection with acquisitions or divestitures, which payments in respect of this clause (b) are
approved by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Parent in good faith;

(12) payment to any Permitted Investor of all reasonable out of pocket expenses Incurred by such Permitted
Investor in connection with its direct or indirect investment in the Parent and its Subsidiaries;

(13) transactions in which the Parent delivers to the Trustee a letter from an Independent Financial Adviser stating
that such transaction is fair to the Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view or meets
the requirements of clause (1) of the preceding paragraph;

(14) any transaction effected as part of a Qualified Receivables Financing;

(15) any participation in public tender or exchange offers for securities or debt instruments issued by the Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries that are conducted on arms’ length terms and provide for the same price or exchange
ratio, as the case may be, to all holders accepting such tender or exchange offer; and

(16) any transaction effected as part of or in connection with a Permitted Reorganization or in connection with an
Initial Public Offering in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement and the provisions of the Indenture described under the section captioned “IPO _Pushdown”._

**_Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries_**

Subject to the last paragraph of the covenant described above under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”, the Parent may
designate any Restricted Subsidiary (other than the Issuer) to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary if that designation would not cause
a Default or Event of Default.

If a Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the aggregate fair market value of all outstanding
Investments owned by the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will
be deemed to be an Investment made as of the time of the designation and will reduce the amount available for Restricted
Payments pursuant to the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” or under one or more clauses of the
definition of Permitted Investments, as determined by the Parent. That designation will only be permitted if the Investment
would be permitted at that time and if the Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary.
Any designation of a Subsidiary of the Parent as an Unrestricted Subsidiary (and any redesignation of an Unrestricted
Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary) will be evidenced to the Trustee by filing with the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate
certifying that such designation complies with the preceding conditions and was permitted by the covenant described under “—
_Limitation on Restricted Payments.” If, at any time, any Unrestricted Subsidiary would fail to meet the preceding requirements_
as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, it will thereafter cease to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary for purposes of the Indenture and any
Indebtedness of such Subsidiary will be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date and, if such
Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness,”
the Issuer will be in default of such covenant.


-----

The Parent may at any time designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary; provided that such designation
will be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary of any outstanding Indebtedness of such
Unrestricted Subsidiary, and such designation will only be permitted if (a) such Indebtedness is permitted under the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” (including pursuant to clause (5) of the second paragraph thereof treating such
redesignation as an acquisition for the purpose of such clause), calculated on a _pro forma basis as if such designation had_
occurred at the beginning of the applicable Relevant Testing Period; and (b) no Default or Event of Default would be in
existence immediately following such designation.

**_Reports_**

So long as any Notes are outstanding, the Parent will furnish to the Trustee the following reports:

(1) within 120 days after the end of the Parent’s fiscal years ending after the Issue Date, beginning with the fiscal
year ending December 31, 2023, annual reports containing: (i) an operating and financial review of the
audited financial statements, including a discussion of the consolidated financial condition, results of
operations and material changes in liquidity and capital resources of the Parent; (ii) unaudited _pro forma_
income statement and balance sheet information of the Parent, together with explanatory footnotes, for any
material acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations (other than the UK&I Disposal) that have occurred
since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal year as to which such annual report relates (unless
such _pro forma information has been provided in a previous report pursuant to clause (2) or (3) below);_
_provided_ that such _pro forma financial information will be provided only to the extent available without_
unreasonable expense, in which case the Issuer will provide, in the case of a material acquisition, acquired
company financials; (iii) the audited consolidated balance sheet of the Parent as at the end of the most recent
two fiscal years and audited consolidated income statements and statements of cash flow of the Parent for
the most recent two fiscal years, including appropriate footnotes to such financial statements, for and as at
the end of such fiscal years and the report of the independent auditors on the financial statements; (iv) a brief
description of the business, management and shareholders of the Parent, all material Affiliate Transactions
and a description of all material debt instruments of the Group; (v) a description of material operational risk
factors and material subsequent events; and (vi) reported Consolidated EBITDA; _provided_ that the
information described in clauses (iv), (v) and (vi) may be provided in the footnotes to the audited financial
statements;

(2) within 60 days following the end of each of the first three fiscal quarters in each fiscal year of the Parent,
beginning with the quarter ended September 30, 2023, quarterly financial statements containing the following
information: (i) the Parent’s unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as at the end of such quarter
and unaudited condensed statements of income and cash flow for the most recent quarter year to date period
ending on the unaudited condensed balance sheet date and the comparable prior period, together with
condensed footnote disclosure; (ii) unaudited pro forma income statement and balance sheet information of
the Parent, together with explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations
(other than the UK&I Disposal) that have occurred since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal
year as to which such quarterly report relates; provided that such pro forma financial information will be
provided only to the extent available without unreasonable expense, in which case the Parent will provide, in
the case of a material acquisition, acquired company financials; (iii) an operating and financial review of the
unaudited financial statements, including a discussion of the consolidated financial condition, results of
operations and material changes in liquidity and capital resources of the Parent; (iv) a discussion of material
changes in material debt instruments since the most recent report; (v) material subsequent events and any
material changes to the risk factors disclosed in the most recent annual report; and (vi) reported Consolidated
EBITDA; _provided_ that the information described in clauses (iv), (v) and (vi) may be provided in the
footnotes to the unaudited financial statements; and

(3) promptly after the occurrence of a material event that the Parent announces publicly or any acquisition,
disposition or restructuring, merger or similar transaction that is material to the Parent and the Restricted
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or a senior executive officer or director changes at the Parent or a change in
auditors of the Parent, a report containing a description of such event.

In addition, the Parent shall furnish to the Holders and to prospective investors, upon the request of such parties, any information
required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act for so long as the Notes are not freely transferable
under the Exchange Act by persons who are not “affiliates” under the Securities Act.


-----

All financial statement information shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS as in effect on the date of such report or financial
statement (or otherwise on the basis of IFRS as then in effect) and on a consistent basis for the periods presented, except as
may otherwise be described in such information; provided, however, that the reports set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above
may, in the event of a change in IFRS, present earlier periods on a basis that applied to such periods. No report need include
separate financial statements for any Subsidiaries of the Parent or any disclosure with respect to the results of operations or any
other financial or statistical disclosure not of a type included in this Offering Memorandum. In addition, the reports set forth
above will not be required to contain any reconciliation to GAAP.

For purposes of this covenant, an acquisition or disposition shall be deemed to be material if the entity or business acquired or
disposed of represents greater than 20% of the Parent’s pro forma total revenue or Consolidated EBITDA or total assets as of
and for the most recent four quarters for which annual or quarterly financial reports have been delivered to the Trustee.

At any time that any of the Parent’s Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such Unrestricted Subsidiary or group
of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, constitutes a Significant Subsidiary of the Parent, then the quarterly and annual
financial information required by the first paragraph of this “Reports” covenant will include a reasonably detailed presentation,
either on the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of
the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted
Subsidiaries of the Parent.

In the event that (i) the Parent becomes subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, or
elects to comply with such provisions, for so long as it continues to file the reports required by Section 13(a) with the SEC or
(ii) the Parent elects to provide to the Trustee reports which, if filed with the SEC, would satisfy (in the good faith judgment of
the Parent) the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (other than the provision of GAAP
information, certifications, exhibits or information as to internal controls and procedures), for so long as it elects, the Parent
will make available to the Trustee such annual reports, information, documents and other reports that the Parent is, or would
be, required to file with the SEC pursuant to such Section 13(a) or 15(d). Upon complying with the foregoing requirements,
the Parent will be deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in this “Reports” covenant; provided, however, that
the Parent shall continue to be subject to the quarterly reporting obligations set out in clause (2) of the first paragraph above.

All reports provided pursuant to this “Reports” covenant shall be in English, or with a certified English translation.

At its election, the Parent may provide consolidated financial statements of a Parent Entity in lieu of those for the Parent, in
which case references to the Parent in the first paragraph of this “Reports” covenant will be deemed to be references to the
Parent Entity, as applicable; provided that if the consolidated financial statements of the Parent Entity are included in such
report, a description of material differences between the consolidated financial statements of the Parent Entity and the Parent
shall be included for the relevant period.

Subject to compliance with the second preceding paragraph, in the event that, and for so long as, the equity securities of the
Parent, any Parent Entity or IPO Entity are listed on a Recognized Stock Exchange and the Parent or such Parent Entity or IPO
Entity is subject to the admission and disclosure standards applicable to issuers of equity securities admitted to trading on such
Recognized Stock Exchange, for so long as it elects, the Issuer will make available to the Trustee such annual reports,
information, documents and other reports that the Issuer is, or would be, required to file with such Recognized Stock Exchange.
Upon complying with the foregoing requirements, and provided that such requirements require the Issuer or any Parent Entity
or IPO Entity to prepare and file annual reports, information, documents and other reports with the Recognized Stock Exchange,
as applicable, the Issuer will be deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs. At its
election, the Parent may provide consolidated financial statements of a Parent Entity in lieu of those for the Parent, in which
case references to the Parent in clauses (1), (2) and (3) of the preceding paragraph will be deemed to be references to the Parent
Entity, as applicable; provided that if the consolidated financial statements of the Parent Entity are included in such report, a
qualitative description of material differences between the consolidated financial statements of the Parent Entity and the Parent
shall be included for any period after the Issue Date starting with the reporting period during which the consolidated financial
statements of such Parent Entity are first used.

Once in each financial quarter, the Parent shall host a single conference call with the Holders about the financial performance
of the Group, at a time and on such date as notified by the Parent (acting reasonably, including by posting a notice on the
Parent’s investor relations website) to the Trustee and the Holders, which, for the avoidance of doubt, may be the same
conference calls as may be held for the benefit of the Group’s lenders under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement.


-----

**_Impairment of Security Interests_**

Midco and the Parent shall not, and the Parent shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, take or knowingly or negligently
omit to take any action that would have the result of materially impairing the Security Interest with respect to the Collateral (it
being understood, subject to the proviso below, that the Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens shall under no circumstances
be deemed to materially impair the Security Interest with respect to the Collateral) for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders,
and Midco and the Parent shall not, and the Parent shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, grant to any Person other than
the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders and the other beneficiaries described in the Security
Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, any interest whatsoever in any of the
Collateral, except that:

(a) Midco, the Parent and any Restricted Subsidiary may amend, extend, renew, restate, supplement, release

or otherwise modify or replace any Security Documents for the purposes of creating, Incurring or
suffering to exist (i) Permitted Collateral Liens or (ii) Permitted Liens over any property or asset of
Midco, the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary that is subject to a floating charge only (and not any other
Lien) under any Security Document, for so long as such a floating charge has not crystallized into a fixed
charge,

(b) Midco, the Parent and any Restricted Subsidiary may amend, extend, renew, restate, supplement, release

or otherwise modify or replace any Security Documents for the purposes of undertaking a Permitted
Reorganization or in connection with any transaction not prohibited by the covenant set forth under “—
_Merger and Consolidation,”_

(c) the Collateral may be discharged and released in accordance with the Indenture, the applicable Security

Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement,

(d) the applicable Security Documents may be amended from time to time to (i) cure any ambiguity, mistake,

omission, defect, error or inconsistency therein, (ii) add to the Collateral, (iii) evidence the succession
of another Person to Midco, the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary providing Collateral and the
assumption of such successor of the obligations under the Indenture, the Notes, the Existing Indentures,
the Existing Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement and/or the Security Documents, in each case, including
in accordance with the terms under “—Merger and Consolidation,” or (iv) evidence and provide for the
acceptance of the appointment of a successor trustee pursuant to the terms of the Existing Indentures or
the Indenture, as applicable, or evidence and provide for the acceptance of the appointment of a successor
Security Agent,

(e) Midco, the Parent and any Restricted Subsidiary may amend the Security Interests in any manner that

does not adversely affect Holders in any material respect (as determined in good faith by the Parent),
and

(f) the Security Interests and the related Security Documents may be amended, extended, renewed, restated,

supplemented, replaced or otherwise modified or released (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien
of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets); provided, however, that in the case of this clause (f),
the Security Documents may not be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, replaced or
otherwise modified or released, unless contemporaneously with any such action, the Parent delivers to
the Trustee, either (x) a solvency opinion, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee from an
Independent Financial Advisor confirming the solvency of the Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement, replacement, modification or release, (y) a certificate from the Board of Directors of the
relevant Person, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, which confirms the solvency of the
Person granting such Security Interest, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment,
extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, replacement, modification or release, or (z) an Opinion of
Counsel, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, confirming that, after giving effect to any
transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, replacement,
modification or release, the Lien or Liens created under the Security Documents, so amended, extended,
renewed, restated, supplemented, replace, modified or released are valid Liens not otherwise subject to
any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, that such Lien or Liens were
not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement, replacement, modification or release.


-----

In the event that Midco, the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary complies with the requirements of this covenant, the Trustee
and the Security Agent shall (subject to customary protections and indemnifications and each of the Trustee and the Security
Agent being indemnified and secured to its satisfaction) consent to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement, replacement or other modification or release without the need for instructions from the Holders.

**_Additional Notes Guarantees_**

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this covenant, and subject to the Agreed Security Principles, no Restricted
Subsidiary (other than the Issuer) shall Guarantee or otherwise become liable for any Indebtedness outstanding under (i) the
Senior Credit Facilities, the Second Lien Credit Facilities or any Credit Facilities that refinance or replace any amounts
outstanding under such facilities, any successor facilities thereof or the Existing Notes or (ii) any Public Debt, in each case, of
the Issuer or a Guarantor unless such Restricted Subsidiary is or becomes a Guarantor reasonably promptly after the date upon
which the Guarantee of such other Indebtedness is Incurred and, if applicable, executes and delivers to the Trustee a
supplemental indenture in the form attached to the Indenture pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will provide a Notes
Guarantee, which Notes Guarantee will be senior to or _pari passu, as applicable, with such Restricted Subsidiary’s Notes_
Guarantee of such other Indebtedness; provided, however, that such Restricted Subsidiary shall not be obligated to become
such a Guarantor to the extent and for so long as the Incurrence of such Notes Guarantee is contrary to the Agreed Security
Principles or could give rise to or result in: (a) any breach or violation of statutory limitations, corporate benefit, financial
assistance, fraudulent preference, thin capitalization rules, capital maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules, retention
of title claims or the laws, rules or regulations (or analogous restriction) of any applicable jurisdiction; (b) any risk or liability
for the officers, directors or (except in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of such Restricted
Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or shareholders of the partners of such
partnership); or (c) any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes) other than reasonable out of
pocket expenses. At the option of the Parent, any Notes Guarantee may contain limitations on Guarantor liability to the extent
reasonably necessary to recognize certain defenses generally available to guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent
conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws,
regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law (including any
usury laws).

Future Notes Guarantees granted pursuant to this provision shall be released in accordance with the provisions under “—Notes
_Guarantees—Notes Guarantees Release,” or in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional_
Intercreditor Agreement, or the Security Documents. A Notes Guarantee of a future Guarantor may also be released at the
option of the Parent if at the date of such release there is no Indebtedness of such Guarantor outstanding which was Incurred
after the Issue Date and which could not have been Incurred in compliance with the Indenture as at the date of such release if
such Guarantor were not designated as a Guarantor as at that date. The Trustee and the Security Agent shall each take all
necessary actions, including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, reasonably requested by the Issuer to effectuate any release of a Notes Guarantee in accordance with
these provisions, subject to customary protections and indemnifications.

The validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests and the liability of each Guarantor will be
subject to the limitations as described and set out in “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—The Notes and the Guarantees
_will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that_
_may limit their validity and enforceability” and “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and_
_Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

**_Additional Intercreditor Agreements_**

The Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Parent, in connection with the Incurrence by the Parent or its Restricted
Subsidiaries of (x) any Indebtedness secured on Collateral or as otherwise not prohibited hereunder and (y) any Refinancing
Indebtedness in respect of Indebtedness referred to in the foregoing clause (x), the Parent or the relevant Restricted Subsidiaries,
the Trustee and the Security Agent shall enter into with the holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly authorized
representatives) an intercreditor agreement (an “Additional Intercreditor Agreement”) or a restatement, amendment or other
modification of the existing Intercreditor Agreement on substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement (or terms
not materially less favorable to the Holders (taken as a whole)), including substantially the same terms with respect to release
of Notes Guarantees and priority and release of the Security Interests; provided that (1) such Additional Intercreditor Agreement
will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent,
as applicable, adversely affect the rights, duties, protections, indemnifications, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee or
Security Agent under the Indenture, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Intercreditor Agreement and (2) if more


-----

than one such intercreditor agreement is outstanding at any one time, the correlative terms of such intercreditor agreements
must not conflict.

The Indenture will also provide that, at the direction of the Parent and without the consent of Holders, the Trustee and the
Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement to: (1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, manifest error or inconsistency of any such agreement,
(2) increase the amount or types (including new Credit Facilities) of Indebtedness covered by any such agreement that may be
Incurred by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary that is subject to any such agreement (including with respect to any
Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the addition of provisions relating to new Indebtedness ranking
junior in right of payment to the Notes), (3) add Restricted Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, (4) further secure the Notes (including Additional Notes), (5) make provision for equal and ratable
pledges of the Collateral to secure Additional Notes, (6) facilitate a Permitted Reorganization, (7) implement any Permitted
Collateral Liens, (8) amend the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with the
terms thereof or (9) make any other change to any such agreement that does not adversely affect the Holders (taken as a whole)
in any material respect, making all necessary provisions to ensure that the Notes and the Notes Guarantees are secured by firstranking Liens over the Collateral. The Parent shall otherwise be entitled to direct the Trustee or the Security Agent to enter into
any amendment to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement with the consent of the Holders of the
majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a
purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, the Notes), except as otherwise permitted below under “—Amendments and
_Waivers” and the Issuer may only direct the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to the extent such_
amendment does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or the Security Agent, or, in the reasonable opinion of the
Trustee or Security Agent, adversely affect their rights, duties, liabilities or immunities under the Indenture, the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture will also provide that, in relation to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the
Trustee (and the Security Agent, if applicable) shall consent on behalf of the Holders to the payment, repayment, purchase,
repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or redemption of any obligations subordinated to the Notes thereby; provided,
_however, that such transaction would comply with the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments.”_

The Indenture will also provide that each Holder of a Note, by accepting a Note, will be deemed to have:

(1) appointed and authorized the Security Agent and the Trustee to give effect to the provisions in the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents and perform
the duties and exercise the rights, powers and discretions that are specifically given to it under the
Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents securing such Indebtedness, together with any other
incidental rights, power and discretions;

(2) agreed to be bound by the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements
and the Security Documents; and

(3) appointed the Security Agent and the Trustee to act on its behalf to enter into and comply with the provisions
of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents
(including the execution of, and compliance with, any waiver, modification, amendment, renewal or
replacement expressed to be executed by the Trustee or the Security Agent on its behalf).

**_Financial Calculations_**

When calculating the satisfaction of or availability under any basket or ratio under the Indenture (including those based on
Consolidated EBITDA, Total Assets, Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio and/or Consolidated Net Leverage
Ratio), in each case, in connection with any acquisition, disposition, merger, joint venture, Investment, Incurrence or other
similar transaction where there is a time difference between commitment and closing or Incurrence (including in respect of
Incurrence of Indebtedness, Restricted Payments and Permitted Investments), the date of determination of such basket or ratio
and of any Default or Event of Default shall, at the option of the Parent, either be (x) the date the definitive agreements for such
acquisition, disposition, merger, joint venture, investment, Incurrence or other similar transaction are entered into or (y) the
date of the committed financing papers providing for the financing of all or a portion of the amounts payable in such
transactions, and in each of the foregoing clause (x) and clause (y), such baskets or ratios shall be calculated on a pro forma
basis after giving effect to such acquisition, disposition, merger, joint venture, Investment, Incurrence or similar transaction
and the other transactions to be entered into in connection therewith (including any Restricted Payment, Permitted Investment,
Asset Disposition, Incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof (including any acquisition completed using such
proceeds) and any other acquisition, disposition, merger, joint venture Investment or other similar transaction that is at the time


-----

of determination the subject of a definitive agreement) as if they occurred at the beginning of the applicable Relevant Testing
Period for purposes of determining the ability to consummate any such transaction (and not for purposes of any subsequent
availability of any basket or ratio). For the avoidance of doubt, (1) if any of such baskets or ratios are exceeded as a result of
fluctuations in such basket or ratio (including due to fluctuations in Consolidated EBITDA, Total Assets, Consolidated Net
Leverage, Senior Secured Indebtedness or cash and Cash Equivalents of the Parent or the target company) subsequent to such
date of determination and at or prior to the consummation of the relevant transaction, such baskets or ratios will not be deemed
to have been exceeded as a result of such fluctuations solely for purposes of determining whether the transactions are permitted
hereunder; and (2) such baskets or ratios shall not be tested at the time of consummation of such transaction or related
transactions; provided, further, that if the Parent elects to have such determinations occur at the time of entry into such definitive
agreement, any such transactions (including any Restricted Payment, Permitted Investment, Asset Disposition or Incurrence of
Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) shall be deemed to have occurred on the date the definitive agreements are
entered and outstanding thereafter for purposes of calculating any baskets or ratios under the Indenture after the date of such
agreement and before the consummation of such transactions.

**Merger and Consolidation**

**_The Parent_**

The Parent will not consolidate with or merge with or into, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all its assets, in one
transaction or a series of related transactions, to, any Person, unless:

(a) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the “Successor Company”) (if not the Parent) will be a Person
organized and existing under the laws of any Permissible Company Jurisdiction and the Successor Company
(if not the Parent) will expressly assume (subject in each case to any limitation contemplated by the Agreed
Security Principles): (a) all the obligations of the Parent under the Indenture; and (b) to the extent required
by applicable law to effect such assumption, all obligations of the Parent, as applicable, under the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents;

(b) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an obligation
of the Successor Company or any Subsidiary of the Successor Company as a result of such transaction as
having been Incurred by the Successor Company or such Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no
Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

(c) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, either (i) the Successor Company would be permitted to
Incur at least an additional €1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described
under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” or (ii) the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio for
the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries would not be higher than it was immediately prior to giving effect
to such transaction; and

(d) the Parent or the Successor Company, as the case may be, shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s
Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each to the effect that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such
supplemental indenture (in the case of the Successor Company) comply with the Indenture and an Opinion
of Counsel to the effect that such supplemental indenture (in the case of a Successor Company) is a legal and
binding agreement enforceable against the Successor Company; _provided_ that in giving an Opinion of
Counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer’s Certificate as to any matters of fact, including as to the satisfaction
of clauses (a), (b) and (c) of this paragraph.

Any Indebtedness that becomes an obligation of the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary (or that is deemed to be Incurred by
any Restricted Subsidiary that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary) as a result of any such transaction undertaken in compliance
with this covenant, and any Refinancing Indebtedness with respect thereto, shall be deemed to have been Incurred in compliance
with the covenant described under “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or substantially all
of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the Parent, which properties and assets, if held by the Parent instead
of such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Parent on a consolidated basis,
shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Parent, as the case may be.

The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the Parent under
the Indenture but in the case of a lease of all or substantially all its assets, the predecessor company will not be released from
its obligations under the Indenture.


-----

Notwithstanding (i) clauses (b) and (c) of the first paragraph of this covenant and the covenant described under “—The
Guarantors (other than the Parent)” (which do not apply to transactions referred to in this paragraph); and (ii) other than with
respect to the third paragraph of this covenant, clause (d) of the first paragraph above: (A) any Restricted Subsidiary may
consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to the Parent; and (B) any
Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor or the Issuer may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer
all or part of its properties and assets to any other Restricted Subsidiary.

Notwithstanding clauses (b) and (c) of the first paragraph of this covenant (which do not apply to the transactions referred to
in this paragraph), the Parent may consolidate or otherwise combine with or merge into an Affiliate incorporated or organized
for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of the Parent to a Permissible Company Jurisdiction, reincorporating the Parent
in a Permissible Company Jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of the Parent.

This covenant (other than the requirements of clause (b) of the first paragraph above) will not apply to: (i) any transactions
which constitute an Asset Disposition if the Parent has complied with the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—
Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock”; or (ii) the creation of a new subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary.

**_The Issuer_**

The Issuer will not consolidate with or merge with or into, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all its assets, in one
transaction or a series of related transactions, to, any Person, unless:

(a) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the “Successor Issuer”) (if not the Issuer) will be a Person
organized and existing under the laws of any Permissible Company Jurisdiction and the Successor Issuer (if
not the Issuer) will expressly assume (subject in each case to any limitation contemplated by the Agreed
Security Principles): (a) all the obligations of the Issuer under the Indenture; and (b) to the extent required
by applicable law to effect such assumption, all obligations of the Issuer, as applicable, under the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents;

(b) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an obligation
of the Successor Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Parent or the Successor Company as a result of such
transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Issuer or such Subsidiary at the time of such
transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing; and

(c) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each to the
effect that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture (in the case of the
Successor Issuer) comply with the Indenture and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such supplemental
indenture (in the case of a Successor Issuer) is a legal and binding agreement enforceable against the
Successor Issuer; provided that in giving an Opinion of Counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer’s Certificate
as to any matters of fact, including as to the satisfaction of clauses (a) and (b) above.

The Successor Issuer will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the Issuer under the
Indenture but in the case of a lease of all or substantially all its assets, the predecessor company will not be released from its
obligations under the Indenture.

Notwithstanding clause (b) of the first paragraph of this covenant and the covenant described under “—The Guarantors (other
_than the Parent)” (which do not apply to transactions referred to in this paragraph):_

(i) any Restricted Subsidiary may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its
properties and assets to the Issuer; and

(ii) any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor or the Issuer may consolidate or otherwise combine with,
merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to any other Restricted Subsidiary.

Notwithstanding clause (b) of the first paragraph of this covenant (which does not apply to the transactions referred to in this
paragraph), the Issuer may consolidate or otherwise combine with or merge into an Affiliate incorporated and organized for
the purpose of changing the legal domicile of the Issuer to a Permissible Company Jurisdiction, reincorporating the Issuer in a
Permissible Company Jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of the Issuer.


-----

**_The Guarantors (other than the Parent)_**

No Guarantor may (other than a Guarantor whose guarantee is to be released in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Parent):

(a) consolidate with or merge with or into any Person, or

(b) sell, convey, transfer or dispose of, all or substantially all its assets, in one transaction or a series of related
transactions, to any Person, or

(c) permit any Person to merge with or into such Guarantor, unless:

(i) the other Person is the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary that is the Issuer or a Guarantor or
becomes a Guarantor; or

(ii) (A) either (x) such Guarantor is the continuing Person or (y) the resulting, surviving or transferee
Person expressly assumes (in each case subject to any limitation contemplated by the Agreed
Security Principles) all of the obligations of such Guarantor under the Indenture and, to the extent
required by applicable law to effect such assumption, the obligations under the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security documents to which it is a
party; and (B) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Default or Event of Default
has occurred and is continuing; or

(iii) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger)
of such Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of such Guarantor
(in each case other than to the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise permitted by the
Indenture.

Notwithstanding sub-clause (c)(ii) of the first paragraph of this covenant and the covenants described under “—The Parent”
and “—The Issuer,” (i) any Restricted Subsidiary may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part
of its properties and assets to a Guarantor; and (ii) if there is more than one Guarantor, any Guarantor may consolidate or
otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to any other Guarantor.

Notwithstanding sub-clause (c)(ii)(B) of the first paragraph of this covenant (which does not apply to the transactions referred
to in this paragraph), a Guarantor may consolidate or otherwise combine with or merge into an Affiliate incorporated or
organized for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of such Guarantor, reincorporating such Guarantor in another
jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of such Guarantor.

**Events of Default**

Each of the following is an “Event of Default” under the Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest on any Note when due and payable, continued for thirty (30) days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Note issued under the Indenture
when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon declaration or
otherwise;

(3) failure by Midco, the Parent, the Issuer or any Guarantor to comply for 60 days (or, in the case of an obligation
set out in “—Certain Covenants—Reports,” 90 days) after written notice by the Trustee on behalf of the
Holders or by the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes with any
agreement or obligation contained in the Indenture;

(4) the occurrence of any default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued
or by which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Parent, the
Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary (or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest
audited consolidated financial statements for the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries) would constitute a
Significant Subsidiary) (or the payment of which is Guaranteed by the Parent, the Issuer or any Significant
Subsidiary (or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated
financial statements for the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary)),


-----

other than Indebtedness owed to the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary, whether such Indebtedness or
Guarantee now exists, or is created after the date hereof, which default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal of such Indebtedness, at its stated final maturity (after giving effect

to any applicable grace periods) provided in such Indebtedness (“payment default”); or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its stated final maturity (the “cross acceleration

provision”),

and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any
other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default of principal at its stated final maturity
(after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) or the maturity of which has been so accelerated,
aggregates €160.0 million or more at any one time outstanding;

(5) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of MidCo, the Parent, the Issuer or a Significant
Subsidiary (or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated
financial statements for the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary)
(the “bankruptcy provisions”);

(6) failure by the Parent, the Issuer or a Significant Subsidiary (or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken
together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Parent and its Restricted
Subsidiaries) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of
€160.0 million other than any judgments covered by indemnities provided by, or insurance policies issued
by, reputable and creditworthy companies, which final judgments remain unpaid, undischarged and unstayed
for a period of more than sixty (60) days (after receipt of notice from the Trustee) after such judgment
becomes final, and in the event such judgment is covered by insurance, an enforcement proceeding has been
commenced by any creditor upon such judgment or decree which is not promptly stayed (the “judgment
_default provision”);_

(7) any Security Interest under the Security Documents having a fair market value in excess of €105.0 million
shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of the relevant
Security Document, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture)
for any reason other than the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Indenture or the release of any
such Security Interest in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents or any such Security Interest created
thereunder shall be declared invalid or unenforceable or the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary shall assert
in writing that any such Security Interest is invalid or unenforceable and any such Default continues for ten
(10) days (the “security default provisions”); provided that the granting of a Permitted Lien over any property
or asset of Midco, the Parent, or any Restricted Subsidiary that is subject to a floating charge only (and not
any other Lien) under any Security Document, for so long as such a floating charge has not crystallized into
a fixed charge, shall not be deemed a breach of this security default provision; and

(8) any Notes Guarantee by a Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary (or group of Guarantors that, taken
together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Parent and its Restricted
Subsidiaries) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) is held in any judicial proceeding to be unenforceable
or invalid or ceases for any reason to be in full force and effect, or any Guarantor that is a Significant
Subsidiary or any group of Guarantors that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial
statements for the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary, or any
Person acting on behalf of any such Guarantor or Guarantors, denies or disaffirms its obligations under its
Notes Guarantee, other than in accordance with the terms of such Notes Guarantee, the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (including with respect to any Notes
Guarantee limitations and the Agreed Security Principles) and any such Default continues for 10 days (the
“guarantee default provisions”).

However, a Default under clauses (4) or (6) of the first paragraph of this section “Events of Default” will not constitute an Event
of Default until the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes notify the
Issuer of the Default and, with respect to such clauses (4) and (6), the Issuer does not cure such Default within sixty (60) days
after receipt of such notice. If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) of the first paragraph
of this section “Events of Default”) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by written notice to the Issuer, or the Holders of at
least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes by written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee, may, and the Trustee


-----

(subject to certain conditions) at the request of such Holders shall, declare the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if
any, on all the Notes to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal and accrued and unpaid interest, if any,
will be due and payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default
described in such clause (4) has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically
annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to such clause (4) shall be remedied
or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have
been discharged in full, in each case, within thirty (30) days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and the
annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

If an Event of Default described in clause (5) of the first paragraph of this section “Events of Default” occurs and is continuing,
the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Notes will become and be immediately due and payable
without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders.

Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and may not enforce the Security
Documents except as provided in such Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement.

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture may waive all past or existing
Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to nonpayment of principal, premium, interest or Additional Amounts which
may only be waived with the consent of Holders of not less than 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
Notes) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Notes and its consequences if rescission would not conflict with
any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection
with another default (the “Initial Default”) occurs, then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to
report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default that resulted solely because of that Initial
Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the
time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “—Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or
certificate or host a conference call pursuant to any other provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the
fulfilment of such requirements, the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or such notice or certificate or the
hosting of any such conference call as are prescribed by such undertakings or covenants, as applicable, even though such
fulfilment, delivery or hosting is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture.

The Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction
of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee in
its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest
when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested in writing the Trustee
to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered in writing and, if requested, provided to the Trustee security and/or indemnity
satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the security and/or
indemnity; and

(5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a written
direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.

Other than in instances in which the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the
Security Documents permit the Trustee or the Security Agent to act without instructions from Holders or with instructions
given by Holders of a lower percentage of principal amount of Notes outstanding, the Holders of a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the outstanding Notes will be entitled to (i) direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding
for exercising any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee under the
Indenture, (ii) give instructions to the Security Agent for the purpose of taking, ceasing or refraining from taking any
enforcement action under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security
Documents, (iii) give instructions to the Security Agent for the purpose of granting or withholding any such consent or


-----

exercising any such remedy or power as may be required or contemplated under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents or (iv) give instructions to the Trustee for the purposes of giving
or withholding any such consent, taking, ceasing or refraining from taking any such action or exercising any such remedy or
power as may be contemplated under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the
Security Documents. The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, of which
a Responsible Officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to
use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to
follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines, without obligation, is unduly
prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. The Trustee shall not have
any obligation to ascertain whether Holders’ actions are unduly prejudicial to other Holders. Prior to taking any action under
the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders, the Trustee will be entitled to receive indemnification and/or
security satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all fees, losses, liabilities and expenses caused by taking or not taking
such action.

The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed in writing of such occurrence
by the Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Issuer. Except
in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold
notice if and so long as the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders.

The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year of the Issuer, beginning with
the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023, an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default
that occurred during the previous fiscal year. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence
thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action
the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Notes Documents may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified with the consent of
Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in
connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes) and, subject to certain exceptions, any default or
compliance with any provisions thereof may be waived with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer
or exchange offer for, Notes). If any amendment, supplement or waiver will only affect one or more series of Notes (but not
all series of Notes), only the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes of the series so
affected (and not the consent of the holders of the majority in aggregate principal amount of all Notes then outstanding) shall
be required.

However, without the consent of Holders holding not less than 90% (or, in the case of clause (9) of this paragraph, 75% and in
the case of clause (11) of this paragraph, 66.67%) of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (provided,
_however, that if any amendment, supplement, waiver or other modification or consent will only affect one or more series of_
Notes (but not all series of Notes), only the consent of the holders of at least 90% (or, in the case of clause (9) of this paragraph,
75% and in the case of clause (11) of this paragraph, 66.67%) of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes
of the series so affected will be required), an amendment or waiver of the Indenture or the Security Documents may not, with
respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any such Note (other than
provisions relating to Change of Control and Asset Dispositions);

(2) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any such Note (other than provisions relating to
Change of Control and Asset Dispositions);

(3) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any such Note or change the time at which any such
Note may be redeemed, in each case as described above under “—Optional Redemption” or “—Redemption
_for Taxation Reasons”;_

(4) make any Note payable in currency other than that stated in such Note;

(5) impair the right of any Holder to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment of principal of, or interest
or Additional Amounts, if any, on such Holder’s Notes on or after the due dates therefor;


-----

(6) make any change in the provision of the Indenture described under “—Withholding Taxes” that adversely
affects the right of any Holder of such Notes in any material respect or amends the terms of such Notes in a
way that would result in a loss of an exemption from any of the Taxes described thereunder or an exemption
from any obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes so described thereunder unless the applicable Payor agrees
to pay Additional Amounts, if any, in respect thereof;

(7) release all or substantially all Security Interests granted for the benefit of the Holders in the Collateral (taken
as a whole) other than in accordance with the terms of the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement,
any applicable Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture; _provided_ that, for the avoidance of
doubt, the release of less than all or substantially all Security Interests granted for the benefit of the Holders
in the Collateral (taken as a whole) where such consent is otherwise required under the Indenture shall only
require the consent of Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding
(including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes)
and any default or compliance with any provisions thereof may be waived with the consent of the Holders of
at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in
connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes);

(8) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal, premium or interest or
Additional Amounts, if any (except pursuant to a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the Holders of at
least a majority in principal amount of such Notes and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from
such acceleration);

(9) release any Guarantor from any of its obligations under its Notes Guarantee or the Indenture, except in
accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement;

(10) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders’ consent described in
this sentence; or

(11) make any change to the last sentence of the definition of “Permitted Collateral Liens” that adversely affects
the right of any Holder of such Notes in any material respect.

For the purposes of determining whether Holders of the requisite aggregate principal amount of any series of Notes not
denominated in euro have taken any action under the Indenture, the aggregate principal amount of such series of Notes will be
deemed to be the Euro Equivalent of the then outstanding aggregate principal amount of such series of Notes determined using
the exchange rate between euro and the applicable currency in which such Notes are denominated on the Issue Date.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Parent, the Issuer, the Trustee and the other parties
thereto (including, to the extent applicable, the Guarantors and Midco), as applicable, may amend or supplement any Notes
Document to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect, error or inconsistency, or conform any provision of the Notes,
the Indenture or the Security Documents to any provision of this “Description of the Notes” or reduce the
minimum denomination of the Notes;

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary
under any Notes Document, including, without limitation, in connection with a Permitted Reorganization;

(3) add to the covenants or provide for a Notes Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or surrender any right or
power conferred upon the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(4) provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes;

(5) make any change that would provide additional rights or benefits to the Trustee or the Holders or make any
change (including changing the ISIN or other identifying number on any Notes) that does not adversely affect
the rights of any Holder in any material respect;

(6) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Parent) for the issuance of Additional
Notes that may be issued in compliance with the Indenture;


-----

(7) provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Notes Guarantee in accordance with the covenants
described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” or “—Certain Covenants—Additional
_Guarantees,” to add Notes Guarantees, to add security to or for the benefit of the Notes, or to confirm and_
evidence the release, termination, discharge or retaking of any Notes Guarantee or Lien with respect to or
securing the Notes when such release, termination, discharge or retaking is provided for under the Indenture,
the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(8) evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement
or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement of a successor Trustee pursuant to the requirements thereof or to
provide for the accession by the Trustee to any Notes Document;

(9) in the case of the Security Documents, mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a Security Interest in favor of
the Security Agent for the benefit of the Holders or holders of Existing Notes or parties to the Senior Credit
Facilities or the Second Lien Credit Facilities, in any property which is required by the Security Documents,
the Existing Indentures, the Senior Credit Facilities or the Second Lien Credit Facilities (in each case, as in
effect on the Issue Date) to be mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in which a Security Interest is required
to be granted to the Security Agent, or to the extent necessary to grant a Security Interest in the Collateral for
the benefit of any Person; in each case, provided that the granting of such Security Interest is not prohibited
by the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” is complied with;

(10) make any amendment to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the transfer and legending of Notes as
permitted by the Indenture, including to facilitate the issuance and administration of Notes; _provided,_
_however, that (i) compliance with the Indenture as so amended would not result in Notes being transferred in_
violation of the Securities Act or any other applicable securities law and (ii) such amendment does not
adversely affect the rights of Holders to transfer Notes in any material respect;

(11) facilitate any transaction that complies with the covenants described under the headings “—Merger and
_Consolidation” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock” relating to_
mergers, consolidations and sales of assets;

(12) as provided in “—Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements”; or

(13) at the Issuer’s election, comply with any requirement of the SEC in connection with the qualification of the
Indenture under the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, if such qualification is required.

For the avoidance of doubt, no amendment to, or deletion of, or actions taken in compliance with, the covenants described
under “—Certain Covenants” or this section “Amendments and Waivers” shall be deemed to impair or affect any rights of
Holders to receive payment of principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on the Notes or to institute suit for the enforcement
of any payment of principal of, or interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes on or after the due dates therefor.

In formulating its decisions on such matters, the Trustee and the Security Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to require and
rely absolutely on such evidence as it deems appropriate, including Officer’s Certificates and Opinions of Counsel.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment of
any Notes Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment. A consent to any
amendment or waiver under the Indenture by any Holder of Notes given in connection with a tender of such Holder’s Notes
will not be rendered invalid by such tender.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the paragraphs above, in order to effect an amendment authorized by clauses
(3) and (7) of the third paragraph of this section “Amendments and Waivers” to add a Guarantor under the Indenture, it shall
only be necessary for the supplemental indenture providing for the accession of such additional Guarantor to be duly authorized
and executed by (i) the Issuer, (ii) such additional Guarantor and (iii) the Trustee. Any other amendments permitted by the
Indenture need only be duly authorized and executed by the Issuer, the Trustee and the Security Agent (to the extent applicable).

The Indenture will not contain a covenant regulating offers and/or payments of consent consideration to Holders.


-----

**Defeasance**

The Issuer at any time may terminate all obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Notes Documents (“legal
defeasance”) and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of Default, except for certain obligations, including those respecting
the defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts, duties, immunities and indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations of the
Issuer in connection therewith and obligations concerning issuing temporary Notes, registrations of Notes, mutilated, destroyed,
lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust.
Subject to the foregoing, if the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, the Security Documents and the rights of the Trustee
and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in effect at such time will
terminate (other than with respect to the defeasance trust).

The Issuer at any time may terminate its obligations and the obligations of the Guarantors under the covenants described under
“—Certain Covenants” (other than clauses (a), (b) and (c) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Merger
_and Consolidation—The Issuer”) and “—Change of Control” and the default provisions relating to such covenants described_
under “—Events of Default” above, the operation of the cross-default upon a payment default, the cross acceleration provisions,
the bankruptcy provisions (other than with respect to the Issuer), the judgment default provision, the guarantee default
provisions and the security default provisions described under “—Events of Default” above (“covenant defeasance”).

The Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise of its covenant
defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of
an Event of Default with respect to the Notes. If the Issuer exercises its covenant defeasance option with respect to the Notes,
payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in clause (3) (other than clauses (a), (b)
and (c) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer”), (4), (5) (with respect
only to a Significant Subsidiary (or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated
financial statements for the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) of the Parent),
(6), (7) or (8) under “—Events of Default” above.

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust (the “defeasance trust”) with the
Trustee (i) for the benefit of the Holders of the Euro Notes, cash in Euro or European Government Obligations or a combination
thereof and (ii) for the benefit of the Holders of the Dollar Notes, cash in U.S. dollars or U.S. Government Securities or a
combination thereof, for the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Euro Notes and the Dollar Notes to
redemption or maturity, as the case may be; provided that, upon any redemption that requires the payment of the Applicable
Premium with respect to the Euro Notes and the Dollar Notes, the amount deposited shall be sufficient for purposes of the
Indenture to the extent that an amount is deposited with the Trustee equal to such Applicable Premium calculated as of the date
of the notice of redemption, with any deficit as of the date of redemption (any such amount, the “Applicable Premium Deficit”)
only required to be deposited with the Trustee on or prior to the date of redemption. Any Applicable Premium Deficit shall be
set forth in an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee simultaneously with the deposit of such Applicable Premium Deficit
that confirms that such Applicable Premium Deficit shall be applied toward such redemption, and in order to exercise either
defeasance option, the Issuer must comply with certain other conditions, including delivery to the Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, to the effect that Holders will not
recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and defeasance
and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts and in the same manner and at the same
times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred (and in the case of legal
defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel must be based on a ruling of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or
change in applicable U.S. federal income tax law since the issuance of the Notes);

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of defeating,
hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Issuer; and

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject to customary
assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or relating to legal
defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement and the Security Documents will be discharged and cease to be of further effect (except as to surviving rights of
transfer or exchange of the Notes and rights of the Trustee, as expressly provided for in the Indenture) as to all Notes when
(a) either (i) all the Notes previously authenticated and delivered (other than certain lost, stolen or destroyed Notes and certain


-----

Notes for which provision for payment was previously made and thereafter the funds have been released to the Issuer) have
been delivered to the relevant Paying Agent for cancellation; or (ii) all Notes not previously delivered to the relevant Paying
Agent for cancellation (A) have become due and payable, (B) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one
year or (C) are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of
notice of redemption by the relevant Paying Agent in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer; (b) the Issuer has deposited
or caused to be deposited with the Trustee, (i) for the benefit of the Holders of the Euro Notes, cash in euro or European
Government Obligations or a combination thereof and (ii) for the benefit of the Holders of the Dollar Notes, cash in U.S. dollars
or U.S. Government Securities or a combination thereof, as applicable, in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire
Indebtedness on the Notes not previously delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and
interest to the date of deposit (in the case of Notes that have become due and payable), or to the Stated Maturity or redemption
date, as the case may be; (c) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable under the Indenture; (d) the Issuer
has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee under the Indenture to apply the deposited money toward the payment of
the Notes at maturity or on the redemption date, as the case may be; and (e) the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s
Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel each stating that all conditions precedent under this “Satisfaction and Discharge” section
relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture have been complied with; provided that any such counsel may rely
on any Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (a), (b), (c) and (d)).

If requested by the Issuer in writing to the Trustee and Principal Paying Agent (which request may be included in the applicable
notice of redemption or pursuant to the above referenced Officer’s Certificate) no later than four Business Days prior to such
distribution, the Trustee shall distribute any amount deposited in trust to the Holders prior to the Stated Maturity or the
redemption date, as the case may be. For the avoidance of doubt, the distribution and payment to Holders prior to the applicable
redemption date or Stated Maturity as set forth above will not include any negative interest, present value adjustment, break
costs or any additional premium on such amounts. To the extent the Notes are represented by Global Notes deposited with a
common depositary for a clearing system, any payment to the beneficial holders holding Book-Entry Interests as participants
of such clearing system will be subject to the then applicable procedures of such clearing system.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders**

No director, manager, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, as
such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer or any Guarantor under the Notes Documents or for any claim
based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Note waives and releases
all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may not be
effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against
public policy.

**Concerning the Trustee**

Deutsche Trustee Company Limited is to be appointed as Trustee under the Indenture. The Indenture will provide that, except
during the continuance of an Event of Default of which a Responsible Officer of the Trustee has been informed in writing, the
Trustee will perform only such duties as are set forth specifically in such Indenture. During the existence of an Event of Default
of which a Responsible Officer of the Trustee has written notice, the Trustee will exercise such of the rights and powers vested
in it under the Indenture and use the same degree of care that a prudent Person would use in conducting its own affairs. The
permissive rights of the Trustee to take or refrain from taking any action enumerated in the Indenture will not be construed as
an obligation or duty.

The Indenture will impose certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a creditor of the Issuer, to obtain
payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect of any such claim as security or
otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions with the Issuer and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries.

The Indenture will set out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed, and replaced. Such terms will include,
among others, (a) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the
outstanding Notes, or may resign at any time by giving written notice to the Issuer and (b) that if the Trustee at any time (i) has
or acquires a conflict of interest that is not eliminated, (ii) becomes incapable of acting as Trustee or (iii) becomes insolvent or
bankrupt, then the Issuer may remove the Trustee, or any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder for not less than 6 months
may petition any court for removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the successor
Trustee.


-----

The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability, taxes (other than net income
or similar taxes) and expenses Incurred without gross negligence or willful misconduct on its part, arising out of or in connection
with the acceptance or administration of the Indenture.

**Notices**

All notices to Holders of Notes will be validly given if electronically delivered or mailed to them at their respective addresses
in the register of the Holders, if any, maintained by the Registrar. For so long as any Notes are represented by global notes, all
notices to Holders will be delivered to DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC,
Euroclear and Clearstream, delivery of which shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph, which will give
such notices to the Holders of Book-Entry Interests.

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published more than once on different
dates, on the first date on which publication is made; provided that, if notices are mailed, such notice shall be deemed to have
been given on the later of such publication and the seventh day after being so mailed. Any notice or communication mailed to
a Holder shall be mailed to such Person by first-class mail or other equivalent means and shall be sufficiently given to such
Holder if so mailed within the time prescribed. Failure to mail a notice or communication to a Holder or any defect in it shall
not affect its sufficiency with respect to other Holders. If a notice or communication is mailed in the manner provided above,
it is duly given, whether or not the addressee receives it. If a notice or communication is given via DTC, Euroclear or
Clearstream, it is duly given on the day the notice is given to DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream.

**Prescription**

Claims against the Issuer or any Guarantor for the payment of principal, premium, if any, or Additional Amounts, if any, on
the Notes will be prescribed ten years after the applicable due date for payment thereof. Claims against the Issuer or any
Guarantor for the payment of interest on the Notes will be prescribed six years after the applicable due date for payment of
interest.

**Currency Indemnity and Calculation of Euro-Denominated Restrictions**

Euro, with respect to the Euro Notes, and U.S. dollar, with respect to the Dollar Notes, are the required currencies (each, a
“Required Currency”) of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer and the Guarantors, if any, under or in
connection with the Notes and the Notes Guarantees, if any, including damages. Any amount received or recovered in a
currency other than the applicable Required Currency, whether as a result of, or the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a
court of any jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of the Issuer, any Guarantor or otherwise by any Holder or by the
Trustee, in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from the Issuer or a Guarantor will only constitute a discharge to the
Issuer or such Guarantor, as applicable, to the extent of the amount of the applicable Required Currency which the recipient is
able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in that other currency on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if
it is not practicable to make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it is practicable to do so).

If the amount of the applicable Required Currency is less than the amount of the Required Currency expressed to be due to the
recipient or the Trustee under any Note, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify them against any loss sustained by such
recipient or the Trustee as a result. In any event, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify the recipient or the Trustee on a
joint and several basis against the cost of making any such purchase. For the purposes of this currency indemnity provision, it
will be prima facie evidence of the matter stated therein for the Holder of a Note or the Trustee to certify in a manner reasonably
satisfactory to the Issuer (indicating the sources of information used) the loss it Incurred in making any such purchase. These
indemnities constitute a separate and independent obligation from the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ other obligations, will give
rise to a separate and independent cause of action, will apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any Holder of a Note or the
Trustee (other than a waiver of the indemnities set out herein) and will continue in full force and effect despite any other
judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in respect of any sum due under any Note or any Notes Guarantee, or
to the Trustee.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction
herein, the Euro Equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is denominated in a non-euro currency shall be calculated based
on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such non-euro amount is Incurred or made, as the case may be.

**Listing**

Application will be made to list the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange and for permission to be granted to deal in the
Notes on the Official List of the Exchange. There can be no assurance that the application to list the Notes on the Official List


-----

of the Exchange will be approved or that permission to deal in the Notes thereon will be granted, and settlement of the Notes
is not conditioned on obtaining this listing or permission.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Since a material portion of the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors that are not organized under the laws of the United States
or the laws of certain states thereof are located outside of the United States, any judgment obtained in the United States against
the Issuer or any such Guarantor, including judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium, interest, Additional
Amounts, if any, and any redemption price and any purchase price with respect to the Notes, may not be collectable within the
United States.

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service**

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Indenture and the Notes, the Issuer and
the Guarantors will in the Indenture irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in the Borough of
Manhattan in the city of New York, county and state of New York, United States. The Indenture will provide that the Issuer
and each Guarantor will appoint an agent for service of process in any suit, action or proceeding with respect to the Indenture,
the Notes and the Notes Guarantees brought in any U.S. federal or New York State court located in the Borough of Manhattan
in the city of New York.

**Governing Law**

The Indenture and the Notes, and the rights and duties of the parties thereunder, shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the state of New York. For the avoidance of doubt, the governing law of the Indenture and the
Notes may be amended with the consent of Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding
(including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes). The Intercreditor
Agreement and the rights and duties of the parties thereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws
of England. The U.S. Security Documents will be governed by, and construed and interpreted in accordance with, the laws of
the State of New York. The non-U.S. Security Documents will be governed by the law of the location of the relevant asset that
is part of the Collateral.

applicable antitrust authority or otherwise necessary or advisable in the good faith determination of the Parent

In the event that a transaction (or any portion thereof) meets the criteria of a permitted Asset Disposition and would also be a

the lessee may terminate such lease upon payment of a penalty (in which case the obligation of the lessee for rental payments
shall include such penalty) after excluding all amounts required to be paid on account of maintenance and repairs, insurance,
taxes, assessments, water and utility rates and similar charges; provided, however, that if such Sale and Leaseback Transaction
results in a Capitalized Lease Obligation, the amount of Indebtedness represented thereby will be determined in accordance
with the definition of “Capitalized Lease Obligations.” For the avoidance of doubt, the obligation of the lessee for rental
payments in respect of leases granted in connection with any Sale and Leaseback Transaction which would be considered an
operating lease under IFRS immediately prior to the adoption of IFRS 16 (Leases) shall not constitute Attributable Debt;

“Bund Rate” as selected by the Issuer, means, with respect to the Euro Notes, as of the applicable redemption date, the yield

statistics are not so published or available, any publicly available source of similar market data selected in good faith by the
Issuer) most nearly equal to the period from the redemption date to        , 2025; provided, however, that if the period from
the redemption date to        , 2025 is not equal to the constant maturity of a direct obligation of the Federal Republic of
Germany for which a weekly average yield is given, the Bund Rate shall be obtained by linear interpolation (calculated to the
nearest one-twelfth of a year) from the weekly average yields of direct obligations of the Federal Republic of Germany for
which such yields are given, except that if the period from such redemption date to        , 2025 is less than one year, the

any debt securities convertible into such equity.


-----

“Capitalized Lease Obligations” means an obligation that is required to be classified and accounted for as a capitalized lease
for financial reporting purposes on the basis of the Accounting Principles. The amount of Indebtedness represented by such
obligation will be the capitalized amount of such obligation at the time any determination thereof is to be made as determined
on the basis of the Accounting Principles, and the Stated Maturity thereof will be the date of the last payment of rent or any
other amount due under such lease prior to the first date such lease may be terminated without penalty.

case maturing within one year after the date of acquisition thereof;

(5) readily marketable direct obligations issued by a Permissible Jurisdiction having one of the two highest rating

and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act as in effect on the Issue Date) of more than 50% of the total voting power
of the Voting Stock of the Parent; provided that for the purposes of this clause (1), no Change of Control

Forma Sale Cost Savings, Pro Forma Purchase Cost Savings or Pro Forma Group Initiative Cost
Savings, as if such Sale, Purchase or Group Initiative occurred on the first day of such period; and

(2) _provided, further,_ however, that, other than in connection with making any Restricted Payment or Investment
pursuant to the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Restricted Payments,” the _pro forma_

On the Issue Date, the Rule 144A Global Note representing the Dollar Notes (the “Dollar Rule 144A Global Note”) will be
deposited upon issuance with the custodian for DTC and registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of DTC. On the
Issue Date, the Rule 144A Global Notes representing the Euro Notes (the “Euro Rule 144A Global Notes”) will be deposited
upon issuance with a common depositary and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts
of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Each series of Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act will initially be represented
by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Temporary Regulation S Global Euro
Notes”) and each series of Dollar Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act will
initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Temporary
Regulation S Global Dollar Notes”, together with the Temporary Regulation S Global Euro Notes, the “Temporary Regulation
S Global Notes”). After the 40th day following the later of the commencement of this offering and the closing of this offering,
the Temporary Regulation S Global Euro Notes will be exchanged for permanent Regulation S global notes in registered form
without interest coupons attached (the “Permanent Regulation S Global Euro Notes”, together with the Temporary Regulation
S Global Euro Notes and the Euro Rule 144A Global Notes, the “Euro Global Notes”) and the Temporary Regulation S Global
Dollar Notes will be exchanged for permanent Regulation S global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached
(the “Permanent Regulation S Global Dollar Notes”, together with the Permanent Regulation S Global Euro Notes, the
Temporary Regulation S Global Euro Notes and the Temporary Regulation S Global Dollar Notes, the “Regulation S Global
Notes,” and, together with the 144A Global Notes, the “Global Notes”). On the Issue Date, the Temporary Regulation S Global
Euro Notes will be deposited upon issuance with a common depositary and registered in the name of the nominee of the
common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable. On the Issue Date, the Temporary Regulation
S Global Dollar Notes will be deposited upon issuance with the custodian for DTC and registered in the name of Cede & Co.,
as nominee of DTC.

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes (the “144A Book-Entry Interests”) and ownership of interests in the
Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests” and, together with the 144A Book-Entry Interests, the
“Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have accounts with DTC, in the case of Temporary Regulation S Global
Dollar Notes, the Permanent Regulation S Global Dollar Notes and the Dollar Rule 144A Global Note (the “Dollar Global
Notes”), and Euroclear and/or Clearstream, in the case of the Euro Global Notes, or persons that may hold interests through
such participants. Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records maintained
in book-entry form by DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream and their participants. The Book-Entry Interests in Global Notes
will only be issued in minimum denominations of $200,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof (in the case
of the Dollar Global Notes) and minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof (in
the case of the Euro Global Notes).

The Book-Entry Interests will not be held in definitive form. Instead, DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, will
credit on their respective book-entry registration and transfer systems a participant’s account with the interest beneficially
owned by such participant. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states of the United States, may require that certain
purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive form. The foregoing limitations may impair the
ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while the Notes are in global form, owners of interests in
the Global Notes will not have the Notes registered in their names, will not receive physical delivery of the Notes in certificated
form (subject to very limited exceptions) and will not be considered the registered owners or “holder” of the Notes under the
Indenture for any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, the custodian for DTC or common depositary for Euroclear and/or Clearstream,
as applicable (or their respective nominees) will be considered the holder of the Notes for all purposes under the Indenture. As
such, participants must rely on the procedures of DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, and indirect participants
must rely on the procedures of DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, and the participants through which they
own Book-Entry Interests in order to exercise any rights of holders of the Notes under the Indenture.

None of the Issuer, the Registrar, the Paying Agents, the Transfer Agents, the Trustee nor any of their respective agents will
have any responsibility or be liable for any aspect of the records relating to the Book-Entry Interests.


-----

**Issuance of Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of the Book-Entry Interests will receive definitive Notes in registered form (the
“Definitive Registered Notes”):

(1) if DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as depositary and
a successor depositary is not appointed by the Issuer within 120 days;

(2) if DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream so requests following an Event of Default under the Indenture; or

(3) if the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through DTC, Euroclear
or Clearstream following an Event of Default under the Indenture.

DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have advised us that upon request by an owner of a Book-Entry Interest described in the
immediately preceding clause (3), their current procedure is to request that we issue or cause to be issued Notes in definitive
registered form to all owners of Book-Entry Interests.

In such an event, the Issuer will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names and issued in any approved
denominations, requested by or on behalf of DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable (in accordance with their
respective customary procedures and based upon directions received from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of
Book-Entry Interests), and such Definitive Registered Notes will bear the restrictive legend as provided in the Indenture, unless
that legend is not required by the Indenture or applicable law.

In the case of the issue of Definitive Registered Notes, the holder of a Definitive Registered Note may transfer such Definitive
Registered Note by surrendering it to the Registrar. In the event of a partial transfer or a partial redemption of one Definitive
Registered Note, a new Definitive Registered Note will be issued to the transferee in respect of the part transferred, and a new
Definitive Registered Note will be issued to the transferor or the holder, as applicable, in respect of the balance of the holding
not transferred or redeemed; provided that a Definitive Registered Note will only be issued in denominations of $200,000 and
in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof (in the case of a Definitive Registered Note relating to the Dollar Notes) and
minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof (in the case of a Definitive Registered
Note relating to the Euro Notes).

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such Definitive Registered Notes have been lost,
destroyed or wrongfully taken, or if such Definitive Registered Notes are mutilated and are surrendered to the Registrar or at
the office of the applicable Transfer Agent, we will issue and the Trustee or an authenticating agent appointed by the Trustee
will authenticate a replacement Definitive Registered Note if the Trustee’s and our requirements are met. We or the Trustee
may require a holder requesting replacement of a Definitive Registered Note to furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the
judgment of both the Trustee and us to protect us, the Trustee and the applicable Paying Agent appointed pursuant to the
Indenture from any loss which any of them may suffer if a Definitive Registered Note is replaced. We and/or the Trustee may
charge for expenses in replacing a Definitive Registered Note.

In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about to become due and
payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by us pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture, we in our discretion may,
instead of issuing a new Definitive Registered Note, pay, redeem or purchase such Definitive Registered Note, as the case may
be.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests only in accordance with the Indenture
and, if required, only after the transferor first delivers to the applicable Transfer Agent a written certification (in the form
provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes.
See “Notice to Investors.”

To the extent permitted by law, we, the Trustee, the Paying Agents, the Transfer Agents, the Registrar and any of their respective
agents shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the absolute owner thereof and no person will be
liable for treating the registered holder as such. Ownership of the Global Notes will be evidenced through registration from
time to time at the registered office of the Issuer, and such registration is a means of evidencing title to the Notes.

We will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Notes; however, owners of the Book-Entry Interests may incur
fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts in DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as
applicable.


-----

**Redemption of the Global Notes**

In the event any Global Note, or any portion thereof, is redeemed, DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, will
distribute the amount received by it in respect of the Global Note so redeemed to the holders of the Book-Entry Interests in
such Global Note from the amount received by it in respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The redemption price
payable in connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by DTC or
Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof).
The Issuer understands that under existing practices of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Notes are to
be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and/or Clearstream or DTC, as applicable, will credit their respective participants’ accounts
on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions) or by lot or on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate
in accordance with their respective operational procedures; _provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest of less than_
$200,000 principal amount (in the case of the Dollar Global Notes) and €100,000 principal amount (in the case of the Euro
Global Notes) at maturity may be redeemed in part.

**Payments on Global Notes**

Payments of amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal, premium, interest, additional interest and
additional amounts) will be made by the Issuer to the Paying Agents. The Paying Agents will, in turn, make such payments to
DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, which will distribute such payments to participants in accordance with
their respective procedures.

Under the terms of the Indenture governing the Notes, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agents, the Transfer Agents, the
Registrar and any of their respective agents will treat the registered holder of the Global Notes (for example, DTC or Euroclear
and/or Clearstream, as applicable, or their respective nominees) as the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and
for all other purposes. Consequently, none of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Transfer Agents, the Paying Agents nor
any of their respective agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

  - any aspects of the records of DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, or any participant or indirect
participant relating to or payments made on account of a Book-Entry Interest, for any such payments made by DTC
or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, or any participant or indirect participant, or for maintaining,
supervising or reviewing the records of DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, or any participant or
indirect participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest;

  - payments made by DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, or any participant or indirect participant, or
for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records of DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, or any
participant or indirect participant relating to or payments made on account of a Book-Entry Interest;

  - DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, or any participant or indirect participant; or

  - the records of the custodian or common depositary, as applicable.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the responsibility of such participants,
as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of subscribers registered in “street name.”

Payments will be subject in all cases to any fiscal or other laws and regulations (including any regulations of the applicable
clearing system) applicable thereto. None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Initial Purchasers, the Paying Agents, the Transfer
Agents, the Registrar nor any of their respective agents will be liable to any holder of a Global Note or any other person for
any commissions, costs, losses or expenses in relation to or resulting from any currency conversion or rounding effected in
connection with any such payment. Holders may be subject to foreign exchange risks that may have economic and tax
consequences to them.

**Currency of Payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Dollar Global Notes will be
paid to holders of interests in such Notes through DTC in U.S. dollars. The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and
all other amounts payable in respect of, the Euro Global Notes will be paid to holders of interests in such Notes through
Euroclear and/or Clearstream in euro.


-----

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that they will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of the
Notes only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes are
credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes as to which such participant or
participants has or have given such direction. DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting
of consents, waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is an event of default
under the Notes, each of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for Definitive
Registered Notes in certificated form, and to distribute such Definitive Registered Notes to their respective participants.

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, will be made in accordance with DTC,
Euroclear and Clearstream rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder requires physical delivery of
Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell the Notes to persons in states which require physical delivery of
such securities or to pledge such securities, such holder must transfer its interest in the Global Notes in accordance with the
normal procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream and in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth in “Notice to Investors.” Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes
will be subject to the restrictions on transfer discussed in “Notice to Investors.”

Beneficial interests in a 144A Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a beneficial interest
in the Regulation S Global Note denominated in the same currency only upon receipt by the Trustee of a written certification
(in the form provided in the Indenture) from the transferor to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with
Regulation S or Rule 144 or any other exemption (if available under the Securities Act).

Subject to the foregoing, and as set forth in “Notice to Investors,” Book-Entry Interests may be transferred and exchanged as
described under “Description of the Notes—Transfer and Exchange.” Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that
is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Book-Entry Interest in the other Global Note of the same
denomination will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the first mentioned Global Note and become a BookEntry Interest in the other Global Note, and accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other
procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it retains such a Book-Entry Interest.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note only as described
under “Description of the Notes—Transfer and Exchange” and, if required, only if the transferor first delivers to the Trustee
and the Registrar a written certificate (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with
the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such notes. See “Notice to Investors.”

**Information Concerning DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable.
The Issuer provides the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the convenience of investors. The
operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that settlement system and may be changed at any time.
None of the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the Paying Agents, the Transfer Agents, the Registrar nor any of their
respective agents are responsible for those operations or procedures.

DTC advised the Issuer that it is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law, a “banking
organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing
corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code, and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to
the provisions of Section 17A of the U.S. Exchange Act. DTC holds and provides asset servicing for issues of U.S. and nonU.S. equity issues, corporate and municipal debt issues, and money market instruments (that DTC’s direct participants deposit
with DTC). DTC also facilitates the post-trade settlement among direct participants of sales and other securities transactions in
deposited securities, through electronic computerized book-entry transfers and pledges between direct participants’ accounts.
DTC is a wholly owned subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”). DTCC is the holding company
for DTC, National Securities Clearing Corporation and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, all of which are registered clearing
agencies. DTCC is owned by the users of its regulated subsidiaries. Access to the DTC system is also available to others such
as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, and clearing corporations that clear through
or maintain a custodial relationship with a direct participant, either directly or indirectly. Euroclear and Clearstream hold
securities for participating organizations, they also facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between
their respective participants through electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and


-----

Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement,
lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities
markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions, such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers,
banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others,
such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear and
Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.

Because DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants
and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not
participate in the DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited
by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical
delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such person may be limited.
In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions
attributable to the Rule 144A Global Notes only through DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream participants.

**Global Clearance and Settlement Under the Book-Entry System**

The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be listed and admitted to trading on the Official List of the Exchange.
Transfers of interests in the Global Notes between participants in DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary
way in accordance with their respective system’s rules and operating procedures.

Although DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests
in the Global Notes among participants in DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, they are under no obligation to
perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued or modified at any time. None of
the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the Transfer Agents, the Registrar, the Paying Agents nor any of
their respective agents will have any responsibility for the performance by DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or their participants
or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the Dollar Notes will be made in U.S. dollars and initial settlement for the Euro Notes will be made in
euro. Book-Entry Interests owned through DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures
applicable to conventional bonds in registered form. Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of
DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream holders on the business day following the settlement date against payment for value on the
settlement date.

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream and will settle in same-day funds.
Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of trading of any Book-Entry Interests
where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are located to ensure that settlement can be made on the desired value date.

**Special Timing Considerations**

You should be aware that investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments and other communications
involving the Notes through DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream on days when those systems are open for business.


-----

**CERTAIN TAXATION CONSIDERATIONS**

_If you are a prospective investor, you should consult your tax advisor as to the possible tax consequences of purchasing, holding_
_or selling any Notes under the laws of your country of citizenship, residence or domicile, including the effect of any local taxes_
_applicable to you. The discussions that follow do not purport to be a comprehensive description of all tax considerations that_
_may be relevant to a decision to purchase, hold or sell Notes. In particular, these discussions do not consider any specific facts_
_or circumstances that may apply to you. The discussions that follow for each jurisdiction are based upon the applicable laws_
_and interpretations thereof as in effect as of the date of this Offering Memorandum. These tax laws and interpretations are_
_subject to change, possibly with retroactive or retrospective effect._

**Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations**

The following is a discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations related to the purchase, ownership and
disposition of the Notes, but does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential tax effects. This discussion is limited to
consequences relevant to a U.S. holder (as defined below) except for the discussion of FATCA (as defined under “—Foreign
_Account Tax Compliance Act”), and does not address the effects of any U.S. federal tax laws other than U.S. federal income_
tax laws (such as estate and gift tax laws) or any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws. This discussion is based upon the U.S.
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), Treasury regulations issued thereunder (the “Treasury Regulations”),
and judicial and administrative interpretations thereof, each as in effect on the date hereof, and all of which are subject to
change, possibly with retroactive effect. No rulings from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) have been or are
expected to be sought with respect to the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not take a
different position concerning the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Notes or that any such
position would not be sustained if challenged.

This discussion does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to a holder in light of
such holder’s particular circumstances, including the impact of the unearned income Medicare contribution tax, or to holders
subject to special rules, such as certain financial institutions, U.S. expatriates, insurance companies, individual retirement
accounts, dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities, U.S. holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar,
tax-exempt entities, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, partnerships or other pass through entities
and investors in such entities, persons liable for alternative minimum tax, U.S. holders that are resident in or have a permanent
establishment in a jurisdiction outside the United States, persons holding the Notes as part of a “straddle,” “hedge,” “conversion
transaction” or other integrated transaction, entities covered by the anti-inversion rules, and persons subject to special tax
accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income with respect to the Notes being taken into account in an applicable
financial statement. In addition, this discussion is limited to persons who purchase the Notes for cash at original issue and at
their “issue price” (i.e., the first price at which a substantial amount of the Notes is sold to the public for cash, excluding sales
to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or
wholesalers) and who hold the Notes as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally for
investment).

For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes,
(i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation or any entity taxable as a corporation for
U.S. federal income tax purposes created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District
of Columbia; (iii) any estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or (iv) any
trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or
more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or if a valid election is in place to treat the
trust as a U.S. person.

If any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the Notes, the U.S. tax treatment
of a partner in the partnership generally will depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. A
partnership considering an investment in the Notes, and partners in such a partnership, should consult their tax advisors
regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes.

**Prospective purchasers of the Notes should consult their tax advisors concerning the tax consequences of holding Notes**
**in light of their particular circumstances, including the application of the U.S. federal income tax considerations**
**discussed below, as well as the application of other federal, state, local, foreign or other tax laws.**

**_Characterization of the Notes_**

In certain circumstances, the Issuer may be obligated to make payments on the Notes in excess of stated principal and interest
(see “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes”, “Description of the Notes—Change of Control” and “Description of the


-----

_Notes—Optional Redemption”) or to repay the Notes before the Initial Maturity Date (see “Description of the Notes—Principal,_
_Maturity and Interest”). We intend to take the position that the foregoing contingencies should not cause the Notes to be treated_
as contingent payment debt instruments. This position is based, in part, on assumptions regarding the likelihood of such
payments as of the date of issuance of the Notes. Assuming such position is respected, a U.S. holder would be required to
include in income the amount of any such additional payments at the time such payments are received or accrued in accordance
with such U.S. holder’s method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Our position is binding on a holder unless
the holder discloses in the proper manner to the IRS that it is taking a different position. If the IRS successfully challenged our
position, and the Notes are treated as contingent payment debt instruments, U.S. holders could be required to accrue interest
income at a rate higher than the stated interest rate on the Note and to treat as ordinary income, rather than capital gain, any
gain recognized on a sale, exchange, retirement or redemption of a Note. This disclosure assumes that the Notes will not be
considered contingent payment debt instruments. U.S. holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the potential
application of the contingent payment debt instrument rules to the Notes and the consequences thereof.

**_Payments of Stated Interest_**

Payments of stated interest on the Notes (including any additional amounts paid in respect of withholding taxes and without
reduction for any amounts withheld) generally will be includible in the gross income of a U.S. holder as ordinary income at the
time that such payments are received or accrued, in accordance with such U.S. holder’s method of accounting for U.S. federal
income tax purposes.

A U.S. holder that uses the cash method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes and that receives a payment of
stated interest on the Euro Notes will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) the U.S. dollar value of the euro
interest payment (translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date such payment is received) regardless of whether the payment
is in fact converted to U.S. dollars at such time. A cash method U.S. holder will not recognize foreign currency exchange gain
or loss with respect to the receipt of such interest, but may recognize exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual disposition
of the euro so received.

A U.S. holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or who otherwise is required
to accrue interest prior to receipt) may determine the amount of income recognized with respect to such interest using one of
two methods. Under the first, a U.S. holder will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) the U.S. dollar value of
the amount of stated interest income in euro that has accrued with respect to its Euro Notes during an accrual period. The U.S.
dollar value of such euro denominated accrued interest will be determined by translating such amount at the average spot rate
of exchange for the accrual period or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average spot rate of
exchange for the partial period within each taxable year. Under the second method, an accrual basis U.S. holder may elect to
translate such accrued interest income into U.S. dollars at the spot rate of exchange on the last day of the interest accrual period
or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the spot rate of exchange on the last day of the taxable
year. Alternatively, if the last day of an accrual period is within five business days of the date of receipt of the accrued interest,
a U.S. holder that has made the election described in the prior sentence may translate such interest at the spot rate of exchange
on the date of receipt of the interest. The above election will apply to other debt instruments held by an electing U.S. holder
and may not be changed without the consent of the IRS. A U.S. holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for
U.S. federal income tax purposes will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss with respect to accrued interest income
on the date such interest is received. The amount of exchange gain or loss recognized will equal the difference, if any, between
the U.S. dollar value of the euro payment received (translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date such interest is received)
in respect of such accrual period and the U.S. dollar value of the interest income that has accrued during such accrual period
(as determined above), regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to U.S. dollars at such time. Any such exchange
gain or loss generally will constitute ordinary income or loss and be treated, for foreign tax credit purposes, as U.S. source
income or loss, and generally not as an adjustment to interest income or expense.

**_Original Issue Discount_**

A series of Notes may be issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A series of Notes will be treated as issued with
OID if the stated principal amount of such series of Notes exceeds its issue price (as defined above) by an amount equal to or
greater than a statutorily defined _de minimis amount (generally, 0.0025 multiplied by the stated principal amount and the_
number of complete years to maturity from the issue date).

In the event a series of Notes are issued with OID, U.S. holders of Notes of such series generally will be required to include
such OID in gross income (as ordinary income) for U.S. federal income tax purposes on an annual basis under a constant yield
accrual method regardless of their regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, U.S. holders
generally will include any OID in income in advance of the receipt of cash attributable to such income.


-----

In the event that a series of Notes is issued with OID, the amount of any OID with respect to a Note of such series includible
in income by a U.S. holder is the sum of the “daily portions” of OID with respect to the Note for each day during the taxable
year or portion thereof in which such U.S. holder holds such Note. A daily portion is determined by allocating to each day in
any “accrual period” a pro rata portion of the OID that accrued in such period. The accrual period of a Note may be of any
length and may vary in length over the term of the Note, provided that each accrual period is no longer than one year and each
scheduled payment of principal or interest occurs either on the first or last day of an accrual period. The amount of OID that
accrues with respect to any accrual period is the excess of (i) the product of the Note’s “adjusted issue price” at the beginning
of such accrual period and its “yield to maturity,” determined on the basis of compounding at the close of each accrual period
and properly adjusted for the length of such period, over (ii) the amount of stated interest allocable to such accrual period. The
adjusted issue price of a Note at the start of any accrual period generally is equal to its issue price, increased by the accrued
OID for each prior accrual period. The yield to maturity of a Note is the discount rate that, when used in computing the present
value of all principal and interest payments to be made under the Note, produces an amount equal to the issue price of the Note.

OID, if any, on the Euro Notes will be determined for any accrual period in euro and then translated into U.S. dollars in
accordance with either of the two alternative methods described in the third paragraph under “—Payments of Stated Interest.”

A U.S. holder will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss when OID is paid with respect to a Euro Note (including,
upon the disposition of a Euro Note, the receipt of proceeds that include amounts attributable to OID previously included in
income) to the extent of the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the euro payment received, translated at the
spot rate of exchange on the date such payment is received, and the U.S. dollar value of the accrued OID, as determined in the
manner described above. For these purposes, all receipts on a Euro Note will be viewed _first, as payment of stated interest_
payable on the Euro Note; second, as receipt of previously accrued OID (to the extent thereof), with payments considered made
for the earliest accrual periods first; and third, as receipt of principal. The rules governing OID instruments are complex and
prospective purchasers should consult their tax advisors concerning the application of such rules to the Euro Notes as well as
the interplay between the application of the OID rules and the currency exchange gain or loss rules.

Foreign currency exchange gain or loss generally will constitute ordinary income or loss and be treated, for foreign tax credit
purposes, as U.S. source income or loss, and generally not as an adjustment to interest income or expense.

**_Foreign Tax Credit_**

Stated interest income (and OID, if any) on a Note generally will constitute foreign source income and generally will be
considered “passive category income” in computing the foreign tax credit allowable to U.S. holders under U.S. federal income
tax laws. Any non-U.S. withholding tax paid by or on behalf of a U.S. holder at the rate applicable to such holder may be
eligible for foreign tax credits (or deduction in lieu of such credits) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, subject to applicable
limitations (including holding period and at risk rules). There are significant complex limitations on a U.S. holder’s ability to
claim foreign tax credits. Certain U.S. Treasury regulations that apply to foreign income taxes paid or accrued in taxable years
beginning on or after December 28, 2021 restrict the availability of any such credit based on the nature of the tax imposed by
the foreign jurisdiction (although Notice 2023-55 provides temporary relief from the application of certain aspects of these
regulations for taxable years ending on or before December 31, 2023). U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding
the creditability or deductibility of any withholding taxes.

**_Sale, Exchange, Retirement, Redemption or Other Taxable Disposition of Notes_**

Upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. holder generally will recognize
gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount realized upon such disposition (less any amount equal to any
accrued but unpaid stated interest, which will be taxable as interest income as discussed above to the extent not previously
included in income by the U.S. holder) and such U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Note.

A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note will, in general, be the cost of such Note to such U.S. holder, increased by any
OID previously accrued by such U.S. holder with respect to the Note. The cost of a Note purchased with foreign currency will
generally be the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency purchase price translated at the spot rate on the date of purchase. If
the applicable Note is treated as traded on an established securities market and the relevant U.S. holder is either a cash basis
taxpayer or an accrual basis taxpayer who has made the special election described below, such U.S. holder will determine the
U.S. dollar value of the cost of such Note by translating the amount paid at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of
the purchase.

If a U.S. holder receives foreign currency on such a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a
Note, the amount realized generally will be based on the U.S. dollar value of such foreign currency translated at the spot rate
of exchange on the date of disposition. In the case of a Note that is considered to be traded on an established securities market,


-----

a cash basis U.S. holder and, if it so elects, an accrual basis U.S. holder, will determine the U.S. dollar value of such foreign
currency by translating such amount at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the disposition. The special election
available to accrual basis U.S. holders in regard to the purchase or disposition of Notes traded on an established securities
market must be applied consistently to all debt instruments held by the U.S. holder and cannot be changed without the consent
of the IRS. An accrual basis U.S. holder that does not make the special election will recognize foreign currency exchange gain
or loss to the extent that there are exchange rate fluctuations between the disposition date and the settlement date, and such
gain or loss generally will constitute U.S. source ordinary income or loss.

Gain or loss recognized upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note that is attributable
to fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the principal amount of such Note generally will be U.S. source
ordinary income or loss and generally will not be treated as interest income or expense. Such gain or loss generally will equal
the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. holder’s foreign currency purchase price for the Note, translated
at the spot rate of exchange on the date principal is received from the Issuer or the U.S. holder disposes of the Note, and the
U.S. dollar value of the U.S. holder’s foreign currency purchase price for the Note, translated at the spot rate of exchange on
the date the U.S. holder purchased such Note. In addition, upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable
disposition of a Note, a U.S. holder may recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss attributable to amounts received
with respect to accrued and unpaid stated interest, which will be treated as discussed above under “—Payments of Stated
_Interest”. However, upon a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. holder will_
recognize any foreign currency exchange gain or loss (including with respect to accrued stated interest) only to the extent of
total gain or loss realized by such U.S. holder on such disposition.

Any gain or loss recognized upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note in excess
of foreign currency exchange gain or loss attributable to such disposition generally will be U.S. source gain or loss and generally
will be capital gain or loss. Capital gains of non-corporate U.S. holders (including individuals) derived in respect of capital
assets held for more than one year are generally eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is
subject to limitations.

U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding how to account for payments made in a foreign currency with respect
to the acquisition, sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note and the foreign currency received upon a
sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note.

**_IPO Pushdown and Release of Guarantees_**

Under certain circumstances, we may undertake an IPO Pushdown (as described under “Description of the Notes—IPO
_Pushdown”), pursuant to which the Parent is entitled to give notice that the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor_
Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (as defined in “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—
_Additional Intercreditor Agreements”)) will automatically operate so that, among other things, the references to the Parent and_
Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in “Description of the Notes—Certain Definitions”) (and all related provisions) shall apply
only to the IPO Pushdown Entity and its Restricted Subsidiaries. In such event, each holding company of the IPO Pushdown
Entity would be released from its obligations under the indenture governing the Notes. In addition, in certain circumstances,
some or all of the Guarantees by the Guarantors could be released and terminated, as described further under “Description of
_the Notes—Notes Guarantees Release” (“Guarantee Release”)._

In either case, such a modification to the terms of the Notes could be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a deemed
exchange of (i) the Notes as in place prior to such modifications for (ii) new Notes as in place after such modifications (“New
Notes”). If such modifications resulted in a deemed exchange, such a deemed exchange could be treated as a taxable transaction
for U.S. federal income tax purposes in which certain beneficial owners of the Notes could be required to recognize gain or
loss. The amount of any gain or loss recognized upon such a deemed exchange of a Note for a New Note would be determined
by reference to the “issue price” of the New Note. The issue price of a New Note will generally equal the fair market value of
such Note or such New Note at the time of the deemed exchange. If the IPO Pushdown or Guarantee Release is treated as a
taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. holder’s holding period in a New Note treated as received in
the IPO Pushdown or Guarantee Release generally will commence on the day after the IPO Pushdown or Guarantee Release,
and tax basis in such New Note would generally equal the issue price of such New Note. Generally, any gain or loss recognized
as a result of such deemed exchange will be taxed under the rules described under “—Sale, Exchange, Retirement, Redemption
_or Other Taxable Disposition of Notes.” If the issue price of such New Note is less than its stated redemption price at maturity_
by more than a de minimis amount, such New Note will be treated as issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In
such event, U.S. holders would be required to include such OID in their income as it accrues, in advance of the receipt of cash
under the rules described under “—Original Issue Discount.” In addition, the determination of whether the New Notes are
treated as “contingent payment debt instruments” as a result of the possibility of additional payments, as described under “—


-----

_Characterization of the Notes,” would be made at the time of the modification. U.S. holders should consult their own tax_
advisors as to the U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to modification of the Notes in connection with the IPO
Pushdown or any Guarantee Release.

**_Tax Return Disclosure Requirements_**

Treasury Regulations require the reporting to the IRS of certain foreign currency transactions giving rise to losses in excess of
a certain minimum amount, such as the receipt or accrual of interest on or a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other
taxable disposition of a foreign currency note or foreign currency received in respect of a foreign currency note. U.S. holders
should consult their tax advisors to determine the tax return disclosure obligations, if any, with respect to an investment in the
Notes, including any requirement to file IRS Form 8886 (Reportable Transaction Disclosure Statement).

U.S. holders who are individuals and who own “specified foreign financial assets” with an aggregate value in excess of certain
minimum thresholds at any time during the tax year generally are required to file an information report (IRS Form 8938) with
respect to such assets with their tax returns. If a U.S. holder does not file a required IRS Form 8938, such holder may be subject
to substantial penalties and the statute of limitations on the assessment and collection of all U.S. federal income taxes of such
holder for the related tax year may not close before the date which is three years after the date on which such report is filed.
The Notes generally will constitute specified foreign financial assets subject to these reporting requirements, unless the Notes
are held in an account at certain financial institutions. Under certain circumstances, an entity may be treated as an individual
for purposes of these rules.

U.S. holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the foregoing disclosure requirements to their
ownership of the Notes, including the significant penalties for non-compliance.

**_Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_**

In general, information reporting requirements will apply to payments of stated interest (and the accrual of OID, if any) on the
Notes and to the proceeds of the sale or other disposition (including a retirement or redemption) of a Note paid to a U.S. holder
unless such U.S. holder is an exempt recipient, and, when required, provides evidence of such exemption. Backup withholding
may apply to such payments if the U.S. holder fails to provide a correct taxpayer identification number or a certification that it
is not subject to backup withholding, or otherwise fails to comply with the applicable requirements of the backup withholding
rules.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as
a refund or a credit against a U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability provided the required information is timely furnished
to the IRS.

**_Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act_**

Pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (provisions commonly known as “FATCA”) and subject to the proposed
regulations discussed below, a “foreign financial institution” may be required to withhold U.S. tax on certain “foreign passthru
payments” made after December 31, 2018 to the extent such payments are treated as attributable to certain U.S. source
payments. Obligations issued on or prior to the date that is six months after applicable final regulations defining foreign passthru
payments are published in the Federal Register generally would be “grandfathered” unless materially modified after such date.
Accordingly, if the Issuer is treated as a foreign financial institution, FATCA could apply to payments on the Notes only if
there is a significant modification of the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes after the expiration of this grandfathering
period. Under proposed regulations, any withholding on foreign passthru payments on the Notes that are not otherwise
grandfathered would apply to passthru payments made on or after the date that is two years after the date of publication in the
Federal Register of applicable final regulations defining foreign passthru payments. Taxpayers generally may rely on these
proposed regulations until final regulations are issued. Non-U.S. governments have entered into agreements with the United
States (and additional non-U.S. governments are expected to enter into such agreements) to implement FATCA in a manner
that alters the rules described herein. Holders should consult their own tax advisors on how these rules may apply to their
investment in the Notes. In the event any withholding under FATCA is imposed with respect to any payments on the Notes,
there will be no additional amounts payable to compensate for the withheld amount.

THE DISCUSSION ABOVE IS A GENERAL SUMMARY. IT DOES NOT COVER ALL TAX MATTERS THAT MAY BE
OF IMPORTANCE TO A PARTICULAR INVESTOR. EACH PROSPECTIVE INVESTOR IS URGED TO CONSULT ITS
OWN TAX ADVISOR ABOUT THE TAX CONSEQUENCES TO IT OF AN INVESTMENT IN THE NOTES IN LIGHT
OF THE INVESTOR’S OWN CIRCUMSTANCES.

**Certain United Kingdom Taxation Considerations**

The following is a summary of the Issuer’s understanding of current law in the United Kingdom and HM Revenue & Customs
(“HMRC”) published practice (which may not be binding on HMRC), relating only to certain aspects of United Kingdom
taxation, both of which may be subject to change, possibly with retrospective effect. It does not purport to be a complete
analysis of all United Kingdom tax considerations relating to the Notes, relates only to persons who are the absolute beneficial
owners of Notes and who hold Notes as a capital investment, and does not deal with certain classes of persons (such as brokers
or dealers in securities and persons connected with the Issuer) to whom special rules may apply. The United Kingdom tax
treatment of prospective holders of Notes depends on their individual circumstances and may be subject to change in the future.
This description does not purport to constitute legal or tax advice and any prospective holders of Notes who are subject to tax
in any jurisdiction other than the United Kingdom or who are in any doubt as to their tax position, should consult an appropriate
professional adviser. In particular, holders of Notes should be aware that they may be liable to taxation under the laws of other
jurisdictions in relation to payments in respect of the Notes even if such payments may be made without withholding or
deduction for or on account of taxation under the laws of the United Kingdom.

**_Interest on the Notes_**

_Payment of Interest on the Notes_

Payments of interest on the Notes may be made without withholding or deduction for or on account of United Kingdom income
tax provided the Notes are and remain listed on a “recognised stock exchange” within the meaning of section 1005 of the
Income Tax Act 2007. The Exchange is a “recognised stock exchange” for these purposes. The Issuer’s understanding of
current HMRC practice is that securities which are admitted to trading on that Exchange may be regarded as “listed on a
recognised stock exchange” for these purposes.

If the Notes are not or cease to be so listed, interest will be paid by the Issuer under deduction of United Kingdom income tax
at the basic rate (currently 20%) unless (i) any other exemption or relief applies or (ii) the Issuer has received a direction to the
contrary from HMRC in respect of such relief as may be available pursuant to the provisions of any double taxation treaty.

Any premium payable on redemption may be treated as a payment of interest for United Kingdom tax purposes and may
accordingly be subject to the withholding tax treatment described above.

In certain circumstances and subject to certain exceptions, the Issuer will be obliged to gross-up payments on the Notes to
ensure that the holders of the Notes receive and retain a net payment equal to the payment which they would have received had
no such deduction or withholding for or on account of United Kingdom income tax been required. See “Description of the
_Notes—Withholding Taxes.”_

_Payments by UK Guarantors_

If a Guarantor which is resident for tax purposes in the United Kingdom (a “UK Guarantor”) makes any payment in respect of
interest on the Notes (or other amounts due under the Notes other than the repayment of amounts subscribed for the Notes)
such payment may be subject to UK withholding tax at the basic rate (currently 20 per cent.) subject to such relief as may be
available under the provisions of any applicable double taxation treaty (following receipt of a gross payment direction from
HMRC) or to any other exemption which may apply. Any such payment by a UK Guarantor may not be eligible for the
exemption which applies where the Notes are and remain listed on a “recognised stock exchange” as described above.

**_Further United Kingdom Taxation Issues_**

Interest on the Notes should constitute United Kingdom source income for tax purposes and may be subject to United Kingdom
tax by way of direct assessment (including self-assessment) even where paid without withholding or deduction. However,
interest with a United Kingdom source which is received without withholding or deduction for or on account of United
Kingdom income tax will not be chargeable to United Kingdom tax on income in the hands of a holder of Notes (other than
certain trustees) who is not resident for tax purposes in the United Kingdom unless (a) that holder of Notes is a company which
carries on a trade in the United Kingdom through a permanent establishment in the United Kingdom or, if not such a company,
carries on a trade, profession or vocation in the United Kingdom through a branch or agency, and (b) the interest is received in
connection with, or Notes are attributable to, that permanent establishment, branch or agency. There are exemptions for interest
received by certain categories of agent (such as some brokers and investment managers). The provisions of an applicable double
taxation treaty may also be relevant for such holders of the Notes.


-----

**_United Kingdom Corporation Tax Payers_**

In general, holders of Notes which are within the charge to United Kingdom corporation tax (including non-resident holders
whose Notes are used, held or acquired for the purpose of a trade carried on in the United Kingdom through a permanent
establishment) will be charged to tax as income on all returns, profits or gains on, and fluctuations in value of, the Notes
(whether attributable to currency fluctuations or otherwise) broadly in accordance with their statutory accounting treatment.

**_Other United Kingdom Tax Payers_**

_Taxation of Interest_

Holders of Notes who are either individuals or trustees and are resident for tax purposes in the United Kingdom or who carry
on a trade, profession or vocation in the United Kingdom through a branch or agency to which the Notes are attributable will
generally be liable to United Kingdom income tax on the amount of any interest received in respect of the Notes.

_Taxation of Chargeable Gains_

If the Notes constitute “deeply discounted securities” for the purposes of Chapter 8 of Part 4 of ITTOIA (as to which, please
see “—Taxation of Discount” below), the Notes should also constitute “qualifying corporate bonds” within the meaning of
Section 117 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992, with the result that on a disposal of the Notes neither chargeable
gains nor allowable losses should arise for the purposes of United Kingdom taxation of capital gains. If Notes are not deeply
discounted securities, they will fall outside the definition of “qualifying corporate bond” mentioned above. Accordingly, any
disposal of such a Note by an individual or trustee holder who is resident for tax purposes in the United Kingdom or who carries
on a trade, profession or vocation in the United Kingdom through a branch or agency to which such a Note is attributable may
give rise to a chargeable gain or allowable loss for the purposes of United Kingdom tax on chargeable gains, depending on
individual circumstances (including the availability of any exemptions or reliefs). In calculating any gain or allowable loss on
disposal of such a Note, sterling values are compared at acquisition, and transfer or redemption. Accordingly, a United Kingdom
taxable gain could arise even where any euro or dollar amount received on a disposal is less than or the same as the amount
paid for a Note.

_Accrued Income Profits_

On a disposal of Notes by a holder of Notes, any interest which has accrued since the last interest payment date may be
chargeable to tax as income under the rules relating to accrued income profits as set out in Part 12 of the Income Tax Act 2007
if that holder of Notes is resident in the United Kingdom or carries on a trade, profession or vocation in the United Kingdom
through a branch or agency to which the Notes are attributable. These provisions will not apply if the Notes are deemed to be
“deeply discounted securities” (as to which, please see “—Taxation of Discount” below).

_Taxation of Discount_

Dependent, among other things, on the discount (if any) at which the Notes are issued, or, in certain cases, the premium (if any)
payable on redemption, the Notes may be deemed to constitute “deeply discounted securities” for the purposes of Chapter 8 of
Part 4 of the ITTOIA 2005. If Notes are deemed to constitute deeply discounted securities, individual or trustee holders of the
Notes who are resident for tax purposes in the United Kingdom or who carry on a trade, profession or vocation in the United
Kingdom through a branch or agency to which the Notes are attributable generally will be liable to United Kingdom income
tax on any profits realized on the sale or other disposal (including redemption) of the Notes; however such holders will not be
able to claim relief from United Kingdom income tax in respect of costs incurred on the acquisition, transfer or redemption of,
or losses incurred on the transfer or redemption of, the Notes. Holders of Notes are advised to consult their own professional
advisers if they require any advice or further information relating to “deeply discounted securities.”

The references to “interest,” “premium” and “discount” above are to “interest,” “premium” and “discount” as understood for
the purposes of United Kingdom tax law. They do not take into account any different definitions of “interest,” “premium” and
“discount” that may prevail under any other tax law or that may apply under the terms and conditions of the Notes or any
related document.

**_Stamp Duty and Stamp Duty Reserve Tax_**

No United Kingdom stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax should be payable on the issue of the Notes or, assuming that (i) the
interest on the Notes does not exceed a reasonable commercial return on the nominal amount of the capital and (ii) any right
on repayment of the Notes to an amount which exceeds the nominal amount of the Notes is reasonably comparable with what


-----

is generally repayable (in respect of a similar nominal amount of capital) under the terms of issue of loan capital listed in the
Official List of the London Stock Exchange, on a transfer of the Notes.

**_Other Rules Relating to United Kingdom Withholding Tax_**

The above description of the United Kingdom withholding tax position assumes that there will be no substitution of an issuer
and does not consider the tax consequence of any such substitution.

**Certain General Tax Considerations**

**_Payments by a Guarantor other than a UK Guarantor_**

If a Guarantor other than a UK Guarantor makes any payment in respect of the Notes, it is possible that such payments may be
subject to withholding tax at applicable rates, subject to such relief as may be available under the provisions of any applicable
double taxation treaty, or to any other exemption that may apply. It is not certain that any such payments will be eligible for
such exemptions.

**CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a summary of certain considerations associated with the acquisition of the Notes by employee benefit plans
that are subject to Title I of the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), plans,
individual retirement accounts (“IRAs”) and other arrangements that are subject to Section 4975 of the U.S. Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) or provisions under any other federal, state, local, non-U.S. or other laws or regulations
that are similar to such provisions of ERISA or the Code (collectively, “Similar Laws”), and entities whose underlying assets
are considered to include “plan assets” of any such plan, account or arrangement pursuant to 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101, as
modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA, or any Similar Law (each, a “Plan”).

ERISA and the Code impose certain requirements on Plans subject to Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code
(collectively, “ERISA Plans”), and on those persons who are fiduciaries with respect to ERISA Plans. Investments by ERISA
Plans are subject to Title I of ERISA’s general fiduciary requirements, including the requirements of investment prudence and
diversification and the requirement that an ERISA Plan’s investments be made in accordance with the documents governing
the ERISA Plan. The prudence of a particular investment must be determined by the responsible fiduciary of an ERISA Plan
by taking into account the ERISA Plan’s particular circumstances and all of the facts and circumstances of the investment
including, but not limited to, the matters discussed under “Risk Factors.”

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit certain transactions involving plan assets (including plan assets
that are not subject to ERISA but which are subject to Section 4975 of the Code, such as IRAs or an entity deemed to hold the
assets of such plans) and certain persons (referred to as “parties in interest” or “disqualified persons”) having certain
relationships to such Plans, unless an exemption is applicable to the transaction. A party in interest or disqualified person,
including a Plan fiduciary, who engaged in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other
penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code.

The Issuer, the Guarantors, the Trustee, the Security Agent, the Paying Agents, the Transfer Agents, the Registrar, the Initial
Purchasers or any other party to the transactions referred to in this Offering Memorandum (together, the “Transaction Parties”)
may be parties in interest or disqualified persons with respect to many Plans. Prohibited transactions within the meaning of
Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code may arise if any of the Notes is acquired or held by a Plan, including but
not limited to where the Issuer, a Guarantor, the Trustee, the Security Agent, the Paying Agents, the Transfer Agents, the
Registrar, the Initial Purchasers or any other party to such transactions is a party in interest or a disqualified person. Certain
exemptions from the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code may be
applicable, depending in part on the type of Plan fiduciary making the decision to acquire any Notes and the circumstances
under which such decision is made. Included among these exemptions are Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and
Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code (relating to transactions between a person that is a party in interest (other than a fiduciary or
an affiliate that has or exercises discretionary authority or control or renders investment advice with respect to assets involved
in the transaction) solely by reason of providing services to the Plan, provided that there is adequate consideration for the
transaction), Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption (“PTCE”) 91-38 (relating to investments by bank collective investment
funds), PTCE 84-14 (relating to transactions effected by a qualified professional asset manager), PTCE 95-60 (relating to
transactions involving insurance company general accounts), PTCE 90-1 (relating to investments by insurance company pooled
separate accounts) and PTCE 96-23 (relating to transactions determined by in-house asset managers). Each of these PTCEs
contains conditions and limitations on its application. Thus, prospective investors should consult with their advisors regarding
the prohibited transaction rules and these exceptions. There can be no assurance that any of these exemptions or any other
exemption will be available with respect to any particular transaction involving any Notes.

Some employee benefit plans, including governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), certain church plans (as
defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA) and non-U.S. plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA), (collectively, “Non-ERISA
Plans”), while not subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of Title I of ERISA or the prohibited transaction provisions
of Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, may nevertheless be subject to Similar Laws which may affect their
investment in the Notes.

Fiduciaries of any such Non-ERISA Plans should consult with their counsel before acquiring the Notes to determine the need
for, if necessary, and the availability of, any exemptive relief under any applicable Similar Law.

Because of the foregoing, the Notes should not be purchased or held by any person investing “plan assets” of any Plan, unless
such purchase or holding will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under ERISA and the Code or
violation of any applicable Similar Laws. Each Plan and Non-ERISA Plan proposing to invest in such Notes should consult
with its counsel to confirm that such investment will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction and will


-----

satisfy the other requirements of ERISA and the Code, if applicable (or, in the case of a Non-ERISA Plan, any applicable
Similar Law).

Accordingly, by acceptance of and/or holding a Note or any interest in a Note, each purchaser and subsequent transferee of a
Note will be deemed to have represented and warranted that either (a) such purchaser or subsequent transferee is not acquiring
or holding the Notes for or on behalf of, and no portion of the assets used by such purchaser or transferee to acquire or hold the
Notes or any interest therein constitutes assets of, any Plan or (b)(i) the acquisition, holding and subsequent disposition of the
Notes by such purchaser or transferee will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of
ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or violation under any applicable Similar Laws and (ii) none of the Transaction Parties is
acting, or will act, as a fiduciary to any Plan with respect to the decision to purchase or hold the Notes or is undertaking to
provide impartial investment advice or give advice in a fiduciary capacity with respect to the decision to purchase or hold the
Notes.

The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all-inclusive, nor should it be construed as legal advice.
Due to the complexity of these rules and the excise taxes, penalties and liabilities that may be imposed upon persons involved
in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries or other persons considering acquiring the
Notes on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan or Non-ERISA Plan, consult with their counsel regarding the suitability of
an acquisition of the Notes in light of such prospective purchaser’s particular circumstances, potential applicability of ERISA,
Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Law to such investments and whether an exemption would be applicable to the
purchase and holding of the Notes. We make no representation as to whether an investment in the Notes is appropriate for any
Plan in general or whether such investment is appropriate for any particular Plan or arrangement. Furthermore, each Plan and
Non-ERISA Plan should consider the fact that none of the Transaction Parties will act as a fiduciary to any Plan or Non-ERISA
Plan with respect to the decision by the Plan or the Non-ERISA Plan to acquire Notes, and are not undertaking to provide any
advice or recommendation, including, without limitation, in a fiduciary capacity, with respect to such decision. All
communications, correspondence and materials from the Transaction Parties with respect to the Notes are intended to be general
in nature and are not directed at any specific purchaser of the Notes, and do not constitute advice regarding the advisability of
investment in the Notes for any specific purchaser. The decision to purchase and hold the Notes must be made solely by each
prospective ERISA Plan purchaser on an arm’s length basis.


-----

**SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES**

_The Issuer of the Notes is incorporated under the laws of England and Wales. The Guarantors are incorporated under the laws_
_of Australia, Belgium, England and Wales, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and the States of California, Delaware,_
_Pennsylvania, Wyoming, Massachusetts, Virginia and Vermont. The documents relating to the Collateral for the Notes will be_
_governed by the laws of Belgium, England and Wales, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, New South Wales and New York. The_
_Indenture (including the Guarantees) and the Notes are governed by New York law. The Intercreditor Agreement is governed_
_by English law. Many of the directors and executive officers of the Issuer and each of the Guarantors are non-residents of the_
_United States. Since the majority of the assets of the Issuer and each of the Guarantors, and its and their directors and executive_
_officers, are located outside the United States, any judgment obtained in the United States against the Issuer or a Guarantor_
_or any such other non-U.S. resident person, including judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium (if any)_
_and interest on the Notes or any judgment of a U.S. court predicated upon civil liabilities under U.S. federal or state securities_
_laws or other laws, may not be collectible in the United States. Furthermore, although the Issuer and each of the Guarantors_
_will appoint an agent for service of process in the United States and will submit to the jurisdiction of New York courts, in each_
_case, in connection with any suit, action or proceeding in relation to the Notes and the Indenture or under U.S. securities laws,_
_it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process on the Issuer or the Guarantors or on such other persons as_
_mentioned above within the United States in any action, including actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S._
_federal securities laws. It may be possible for investors to effect service of process within other jurisdictions upon those persons,_
_the Issuer or the Guarantors provided that, for example, The Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and_
_Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters of November 15, 1965 is complied with._

_If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. court against the Issuer or a Guarantor, or any of their respective director or officers,_
_investors will need to enforce such judgment in jurisdictions where the relevant company or individual has assets. Even though_
_the enforceability of U.S. court judgments outside the United States is summarized in part below for the countries in which_
_each of the Issuer and the Guarantors or the Collateral is located, you should consult with your own advisors in any pertinent_
_jurisdictions as needed to enforce a judgment in those countries or elsewhere outside the United States._

**Australia**

Australia has a procedure for recognizing and enforcing foreign judgments by registration of the foreign judgment in an
Australian court in accordance with the procedure set out in the Australian Foreign Judgments Act 1991 (Cth) or by recognition
in accordance with common law principles. The United States is not one of the countries to which the Foreign Judgments Act
1991 (Cth) applies. As a result, the recognition and enforcement in Australian courts of judgments from U.S. courts requires
the application of common law principles. Further, any action taken by or on behalf of the holders of the Notes may need to be
brought in the Australian courts on the basis of the merits of the case, in addition (or as an alternative) to bringing such action
on the basis of recognition of the judgment from the relevant U.S. court.

Accordingly, there are risks as to the enforceability, in original actions in Australian courts, of liabilities predicated solely on
the U.S. federal or state securities law and as to the enforceability, in Australian courts, of judgments of U.S. courts obtained
in actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or state securities laws. Also, judgments of U.S. courts
(whether or not such judgments relate to U.S. federal or state securities laws) may not be enforceable in Australia in certain
other circumstances, including, among others, to the extent that such judgments (as a matter of applicable Australian law)
contravene public policy, breach the rules of natural justice or general principles of fairness or are obtained by fraud or duress
or are based on a clear mistake of fact, are not for a fixed or readily ascertainable sum, or are subject to appeal, dismissal, stay
of execution or are otherwise not final and conclusive, or involve multiple or punitive damages, or are not between identical
parties and in the same interest, or are rendered by a court that did not have jurisdiction according to the private international
law rules of the local court, or where the proceedings in such courts were of a revenue or penal nature, or where the judgment
is one in respect of which the Australian Commonwealth Attorney-General has made a declaration or order under the Australian
Foreign Proceedings (Excess of Jurisdiction) Act 1984 (Cth).

**Belgium**

**_Recognition and Enforcement of Judgements Obtained in the Courts of a European Member State_**

Pursuant to the provisions of the European Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of
December 12, 2012 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (the
“Brussels I Regulation (recast)”), the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments is subject in Belgium to a light
procedure when the judgment has been rendered by a court of a European Member State.


-----

Civil and commercial judgements of the courts of a European Member State will be recognized in Belgium without any special
procedure being required. Recognition and enforcement can only be refused if:

  - such recognition and enforcement would be manifestly incompatible with Belgian public policy (openbare orde/ordre
_public);_

  - the judgment was given in default of appearance and the defendant was not served with the document which instituted
the proceedings or with an equivalent document in sufficient time and in such a way as to enable it to arrange for its
defense, unless the defendant failed to commence proceedings to challenge the judgment when it was possible for it
to do so;

  - the judgment is irreconcilable with a Belgian judgment given in a dispute between the same parties;

  - the judgment is irreconcilable with an earlier judgment given in another European Member State or a third state
involving the same object and cause of action and between the same parties, provided the earlier judgment meets the
conditions necessary for its recognition in Belgium; or

  - the judgment conflicts with Sections 3, 4, 5 or 6 of Chapter II of the Brussels I Regulation (recast) (namely matters
relating to insurance, consumer contracts or exclusive jurisdiction).

Such judgment shall be declared enforceable on completion of the formalities referred to in Article 53 of the Brussels I
Regulation (recast), subject to the right to lodge proceedings against any such decision as set out in Article 43 of the Brussels
I Regulation (recast). Enforcement of the judgment may, however, be stayed if it is subject to an ordinary appeal in the country
in which the judgment was given.

If the claim is uncontested, the European Regulation (EC) No 805/2004 creating a European Enforcement Order for uncontested
claims may apply.

Specific rules apply in the context of insolvency proceedings. In such cases, the recognition of insolvency proceedings will be
governed by the European Regulation (EU) No 2015/848 on insolvency proceedings.

**_Recognition and Enforcement of Judgements Obtained in a Court in the United States_**

In the absence of any bilateral or multilateral treaty, a final and enforceable judgment of the courts exercising jurisdiction in
the United States would be recognized and enforced by the courts of Belgium without review on the merits subject to the
conditions specified in Articles 22 to 25 of the law of July 16, 2004 which implements the Code of Private International Law
(Wetboek van Internationaal Privaatrecht/Code de droit international privé) (the “Code of Private International Law”).

Pursuant to Article 24 of the Code of Private International Law, the following documents must be produced in court by the
claimant seeking enforcement: (a) an official copy of the judgment (uitgifte van de beslissing/ expédition de la décision)
fulfilling all conditions required for its authentication under the applicable foreign law; (b) if obtained by default, an original
or legalized copy of the document demonstrating that the originating process has been served on the defendant in accordance
with the applicable foreign law or an equivalent document in accordance with the applicable foreign law demonstrating that
the judgment was served or notified to the party that did not appear; and (c) any document demonstrating that, under the
applicable foreign law, the judgment is enforceable and has been notified to the defendant.

Articles 22 et seq. of the Belgian Code of Private International Law mainly require that the recognition or enforcement of the
foreign judgment should not be a manifest violation of public policy, that the foreign courts must have respected the rights of
defense, that the foreign judgment should be final, and that the assumption of jurisdiction by the foreign court may not have
breached certain principles of Belgian law.

However, recognition and enforcement can be refused in the circumstances described in Article 25 of the Code of Private
International Law, and notably if

  - the rights of defense have been violated;

  - such recognition or enforcement would be manifestly incompatible with Belgian public policy;

  - the jurisdiction of the foreign judge was based solely on the presence of the defendant or assets without any direct
connection with the dispute in the foreign state;


-----

  - without prejudice to article 23.4 of the Belgian Code of Private International Law, the decision is not final and may
still be appealed under the applicable foreign law (however, provisional enforcement could then be granted) or does
not meet the requirements of authenticity pursuant to the applicable laws;

  - if in relation to matters for which parties cannot freely dispose of their rights, the decision has been sought with the
sole purpose of escaping from the application of the laws applicable in accordance with Belgian private international
law;

  - the claim was filed in the United States after the filing in Belgium of a claim that is still pending between the same
parties with respect to the same subject matter;

  - the judgment is incompatible with a decision rendered in Belgium or a prior judgment rendered in another jurisdiction
that can be recognized in Belgium;

  - Belgian jurisdictions have exclusive jurisdiction in respect of the claim; or

  - the decision is in conflict with the rules on the recognition and enforcement of court decisions in relation to insolvency
proceedings, intellectual property or corporate standing.

Note that the foreign judgment for which enforcement is sought will not be reviewed on the merits.

As a general principle, procedural rules are governed by the law of the jurisdiction of the court (lex fori). In Belgium the
procedural rules contained in, among others, the Belgian Judicial Code and the Code of Private International Law will apply
when recognition and enforcement of judgments rendered by United States courts is sought in Belgium.

In the case of an enforcement through legal proceedings in Belgium (including the exequatur of foreign court decisions in
Belgium), a registration tax at the rate of 3% of the amount of the judgment is payable by the debtor if the sum of money that
the debtor is ordered to pay by (a) a Belgian court or (b) a foreign court judgment that is either (i) automatically enforceable
and registered in Belgium or (ii) rendered enforceable by a Belgian court, exceeds EUR 12,500. A nominal registration tax
would be due on the registration of bailiff deeds.

The Code of Private International Law contains specific rules for the enforcement of judgements that relate to insolvency
matters.

**_England and Wales_**

The United States and the United Kingdom currently do not have a treaty between them providing for the reciprocal recognition
and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final
judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not
predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, would not automatically be recognized or directly enforceable in England
and Wales. In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in England and Wales, fresh proceedings must first be initiated before
a court of competent jurisdiction in England and Wales. In such an action, an English court would not generally reinvestigate
the merits of the original matter decided by the U.S. court (subject to what is described below) and it would usually be possible
to obtain summary judgment on such a claim (assuming that there is no good defense to it). Summary judgment is a procedure
by which the English court can dispose of all or part of a claim without proceeding to a full trial. Recognition and enforcement
of a U.S. judgment by an English court in such an action may be conditional upon (among other things) the following:

  - the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to English conflicts of laws principles
and rules of English private international law at the time when proceedings were initiated (in other words, it does not
matter that the U.S. court had jurisdiction according to its own law, but instead whether it had jurisdiction according
to the rules of English private international law);

  - the U.S. judgment not having been given in breach of a jurisdiction or arbitration clause except with the agreement of
the relevant parties or the relevant parties’ subsequent submission to the jurisdiction of the court;

  - the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and unalterable in the court
which pronounced it and being for a debt for a definite sum of money;


-----

  - the recognition or enforcement, as the case may be, of the U.S. judgment not contravening English public policy, the
European Convention on Human Rights or English law including the Human Rights Act 1998 (or any subordinate
legislation made thereunder, to the extent applicable);

  - the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like nature, or in respect of a
penalty or fine, or otherwise involving the enforcement of a non-English penal or revenue law, or other public law;

  - the U.S. judgment not having been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a sum assessed as
compensation for the loss or damages sustained and not being otherwise in breach of the Protection of Trading Interests
Act 1980;

  - the U.S. judgment not having been obtained by fraud or in breach of English principles of natural justice;

  - there not having been a prior inconsistent, determinative or conflicting judgment of an English or other non-U.S. court
in respect of the same matter involving the same parties and/or prior inconsistent judgment given in a Hague
Convention member state or other court which the English Court must recognize and enforce under the Hague
Convention Choice of Court Agreements of June 30, 2005 (the “Hague Convention”) and/ or the Lugano Conventions
of 2007 (the “Lugano Conventions”) or other law;

  - the U.S. judgment not having been wholly satisfied or not being enforceable by execution in the United States;

  - the party seeking enforcement providing security for costs, if ordered to do so by the English court; and

  - the English enforcement proceedings being commenced within the relevant limitation period.

Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce judgments in England and Wales in civil and commercial matters
that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, we cannot assure you that those judgments will be
recognized or enforceable in England and Wales. In addition, it is questionable whether an English court would accept
jurisdiction and impose civil liability if proceedings were commenced in England and Wales, instead of the United States, in
an original action predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws or other laws. Further, it may not be possible to obtain a
judgment in England and Wales or to enforce the judgment if the judgment debtor is or becomes subject to any insolvency or
similar proceedings, or if the judgment debtor has any setoff or counterclaim against the judgment creditor. Finally, note that,
in any enforcement proceedings, the judgment debtor may raise any counterclaim that could have been brought if the action
had been originally brought in England and Wales unless the subject of the counterclaim was in issue and denied in the U.S.
proceedings.

**Germany**

There is doubt as to the enforceability in Germany of civil liabilities based on U.S. federal or state securities laws, either in an
original action or in an action to enforce a judgment obtained in U.S. federal or state courts. The United States and Germany
currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration
awards, in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment by any U.S. federal or state court for payment, whether
or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in Germany. A final
judgment by a U.S. federal or state court, however, may be recognized and enforced in Germany in an action before a court of
competent jurisdiction in accordance with the proceedings set forth by the German Code of Civil Procedure
(Zivilprozessordnung). In such an action, a German court generally would not reinvestigate the merits of the original matter
decided by a U.S. court, except as noted below. The recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by a German court would
be conditional upon a number of factors, including the following:

  - the judgment being final under U.S. federal or state law;

  - the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceeding according to German law;

  - the document introducing the proceedings was duly served and made known to the defendant in a timely manner that
allowed for adequate defense and the defendant having had the chance to defend herself or himself against an unduly
or untimely served complaint;

  - the judgment of the U.S. court not being incompatible with a judgment of a German court or an already recognized
judgment of a foreign court handed down before the judgment of the U.S. court and the procedure leading to the
respective judgment not being in contradiction to any such prior judgment;


-----

  - the matter (Verfahren) resulting in the judgment of the U.S. court not being incompatible with a matter (Verfahren)
pending before a German court, provided that such German matter was pending prior to the U.S. court rendering its
judgment;

  - the enforcement of the judgment by the U.S. court being compatible with the essential principles of German law (ordre
_public), in particular with the civil rights (Grundrechte) guaranteed by virtue of the German Constitution_
(Grundgesetz); and

  - generally, the guarantee of reciprocity.

There is some German case law to the effect that reciprocity of the recognition of judgments is ensured in relation to claims
relating to assets (vermögensrechtliche Ansprüche) with regard to various U.S. states. We cannot, however, assure you that
attempts to enforce judgments in Germany will be successful. It is also doubtful whether a German court would accept
jurisdiction and impose civil liability in an original action solely predicated by U.S. federal securities laws.

Subject to the foregoing, purchasers of securities may be able to enforce judgments in civil and commercial matters obtained
from U.S. courts in Germany. We cannot, however, assure you that attempts to enforce judgments in Germany will be
successful.

German courts usually deny the recognition and enforcement of penal or punitive damages. Moreover, a German court may
reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are necessary to
compensate actual losses or damages.

German civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of respects. In as far as the production of
evidence is concerned, U.S. law and the laws of several other jurisdictions based on common law provide for pretrial discovery,
a process by which parties to the proceedings may prior to trial compel the production of documents by adverse or third parties
and the deposition of witnesses. Evidence obtained in this manner may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. No
equivalent pretrial discovery process exists under German law.

If the party in whose favor such final judgment is rendered brings a new lawsuit in a competent court in Germany, such party
may submit to the German court the final judgment rendered in the United States. Under such circumstances, a judgment by a
U.S. federal or state court will be regarded by a German court only as evidence of the outcome of the dispute to which such
judgment relates. A German court may choose to re-hear the dispute and may render a judgment not in line with the judgment
rendered by a U.S. federal or state court (to the extent such judgment is not enforceable in Germany).

In addition, it may under certain circumstances also not be possible for investors to effect service of process within Germany
upon the Issuer or the Guarantors or those persons under the Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial
Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters of November 15, 1965 and the German law implementing such convention if such
service were deemed to infringe German sovereignty or security, which may be the case if such service violated the fundamental
principles of German law, in particular the civil rights (Grundrechte) guaranteed by virtue of the German Constitution
(Grundgesetz). However, the German Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht) held in 2013 that service may not be
denied solely because the action before the U.S. court contains claims for punitive damages.

**Italy**

Recognition and enforcement in Italy of final judgments rendered by U.S. courts, including judgements obtained in actions
predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws, may not require retrial and will be
enforceable in Italy, provided that pursuant to Article 64 of Italian Law No. 218 of May 31, 1995 (Riforma del sistema italiano
_di diritto internazionale privato) the following conditions are met:_

  - the U.S. court which rendered the final judgment had jurisdiction according to Italian law principles of jurisdiction;

  - the relevant summons and complaint were appropriately served on the defendants in accordance with U.S. law and
during the proceedings the essential rights of the defendant have not been violated during the proceeding;

  - the parties to the proceeding appeared before the court in accordance with U.S. law or, in the event of default by the
defendant, the U.S. court declared such default in accordance with U.S. law;

  - the judgment is final (sentenza passata in giudicato) and not subject to any further appeal in accordance with U.S.
law;


-----

  - there is no conflicting final judgment (sentenza passata in giudicato) and not subject to any further appeal rendered
by an Italian court;

  - there is no action pending in Italy among the same parties for decision on the same matter which commenced prior to
the action in the United States; and

  - the provisions of such judgment would not violate Italian public policy (ordine pubblico).

In addition, pursuant to Article 67 of Italian Law No. 218 of May 31, 1995, if a judgment rendered by a U.S. court is not
complied with, its recognition is challenged or its compulsory enforcement is necessary, then a proceeding shall be initiated
before the competent Court of Appeal in the Republic of Italy to that end. The competent Court of Appeal does not consider
the merits of the case but exclusively ascertains the fulfillment of all the conditions set out above (including that requiring that
the judgment rendered by the U.S. federal or New York state court is not contrary to public policy (ordine pubblico) in Italy).

In original actions brought before Italian courts, the enforceability of liabilities or remedies based solely on the U.S. federal
securities law is debatable. If an original action is brought before an Italian court, the Italian court may apply not only Italian
rules of civil procedure, but also Italian substantive law (based on the applicable conflict-of-laws provisions) and/or certain
substantive provisions of Italian law that are regarded as mandatory and may refuse to apply the U.S. law provisions or grant
some of the remedies sought (e.g., punitive damages) if their application violates Italian public policy and/or any mandatory
provisions of Italian law.

**The Netherlands**

There is no treaty regarding the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judicial decisions (other than arbitration awards) in
civil and commercial matters between the United States and the Netherlands. Therefore, an executable judgment rendered by
any competent court of New York, the United States, would not automatically be enforceable in the Netherlands. However, a
final judgment obtained in a competent court of New York, the United States, and not rendered by default, which is not subject
to appeal or other means of contestation and is enforceable in the United States with respect to the payment of obligations of a
Dutch company (such as Dutch Guarantors) under the documents expressed to be subject to the laws of the State of New York
(such as, inter alia, the Notes and the Indenture) would generally be upheld and be regarded by a Dutch court as conclusive
evidence when asked to render a judgment in accordance with that judgment by a competent court of New York, the United
States, without substantive re-examination or re-litigation of the merits of the subject matter thereof, if (i) that judgment has
been rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction, in accordance with the principles of due justice, its contents and enforcement
do not conflict with Dutch public policy (openbare orde) and it has not been rendered in proceedings of a criminal law or
revenue or other public law nature, (ii) the jurisdiction of the competent court has been based on grounds that are internationally
acceptable, (iii) the judgment was rendered in legal proceedings that comply with the standards of the proper administration of
justice that includes sufficient safeguards (behoorlijke rechtspleging) and (iv) the judgment is not incompatible with a decision
rendered between the same parties by a Dutch court, or with a previous decision rendered between the same parties by a foreign
court in a dispute that concerns the same subject and is based on the same cause, provided that the previous decision qualifies
for acknowledgement in the Netherlands.

Any enforcement of foreign judgments in the Netherlands will be subject to the applicable rules of civil procedure in the
Netherlands. A Dutch court has the authority to make an award in a foreign currency. However, enforcement against assets in
the Netherlands of a judgment for a sum of money expressed in foreign currency would be executed in Dutch legal tender and
the applicable rate of exchange prevailing at the date of payment.

A Dutch court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a United States court and recognize damages only to the extent
that they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages.

Enforcement of obligations before a Dutch court will be subject to the degree to which the relevant obligations are enforceable
under their governing law, to the nature of the remedies available in Dutch courts, the acceptance by such courts of jurisdiction,
the effect of provisions imposing prescription periods and to the availability of defenses such as set off (unless validly waived)
and counter-claim; specific performance may not always be awarded.

**CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE VALIDITY AND**

**ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND THE SECURITY INTERESTS**

**Australia**

Australian law imposes a strict duty on directors of a company to prevent insolvent trading. For directors, failure to prevent
insolvent trading carries with it a risk of personal liability under section 588G of the Australian _Corporations Act, which if_
established can result in civil and criminal penalties.

Certain Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of Australia (“Australian Guarantors”). Therefore, insolvency processes
with respect to them are likely to be governed by Australian insolvency law. The insolvency law and processes which apply in
Australia are different from the insolvency laws of the United States.

If an Australian Guarantor becomes insolvent, the treatment and ranking of holders of the Notes, other creditors of the company
and the shareholders under Australian law may be different to the resulting treatment and ranking if that Australian Guarantor
was subject to the bankruptcy laws of the United States or other jurisdictions.

There are four principal corporate insolvency processes in Australia: (a) administration (sometimes referred to as voluntary
administration); (b) deed of company arrangement; (c) liquidation (also referred to as winding up); and (d) receivership. There
is also a fifth less common regime pursuant to a scheme of arrangement. A brief description of each process is set out below.

**_Administration_**

Under section 435A of the Australian Corporations Act, the object of administration is to provide for the business, property
and affairs of an insolvent company to be administered in a way that maximizes the chances of the company, or as much as
possible of its business, continuing in existence. Alternatively, if it is not possible for the company or its business to continue
in existence, the object of the administration is to achieve a better return for the company’s creditors and members than would
result from an immediate winding up of the company.

A company is placed into administration by: (i) a resolution of its board of directors if the board resolves that the company is
insolvent or is likely to become insolvent at some future time and an administrator should be appointed; (ii) a liquidator, or a
provisional liquidator, of the company if the liquidator or provisional liquidator thinks the company is insolvent or is likely to
become insolvent at some future time; or (iii) a secured creditor who is entitled to enforce its security over the whole or
substantially the whole of the company’s property, if the security interest has become, and is still, enforceable (although a
secured creditor would usually prefer to appoint a receiver who, unlike an administrator, will, subject to some duties being
owed to the company, primarily act in the interests of the secured creditor).

Within eight business days of that administrator being appointed, a meeting of the debtor’s creditors (termed “the first meeting
of creditors”) is to be held to give the creditors the opportunity to reject the initially appointed administrator and appoint another
administrator, and to decide whether to appoint a committee of creditors.

An administration is intended to be for a short period (20 business days or 25 business days if the administration occurs during
the Christmas or Easter holiday period), but this time period is often extended by an adjournment of the second meeting of
creditors or by court order.

During the administration, an administrator controls the company and acts as its agent. The powers of the directors and officers
are suspended, though they remain in office and have a duty to assist the administrator. Transfers of shares in the company are
void unless the administrator gives his written consent or a court authorizes the transfer.

The administrator’s role is to assess the company’s situation and its options (liquidation, execution of a deed of company
arrangement or to return the company to the control of its directors) and report to creditors to assist creditors with deciding as
to which option should be followed. The creditors in the second meeting of creditors vote on which option is to be adopted and
a resolution is carried on the voices by a simple majority (in number), unless a poll is conducted in which case a resolution is
carried by number and value. Once passed, the resolution is binding on all of the company’s creditors. If, among other matters,
secured creditors elect not to vote on a resolution that the company execute a deed of company arrangement, they will not be
bound by the deed of company arrangement. The capacity to elect whether to vote on the resolution gives secured creditors a
significant measure of control over the outcome of the administration procedure, in particular whether a deed of company
arrangement will provide the most desirable outcome for secured creditors.


-----

To permit the administrator the opportunity to make an assessment of what options are available to creditors, for the duration
of the administration there is a stay on the enforcement of creditors’ claims, actions against the company and its property
(subject to certain exceptions, such as (i) the enforcement of a security interest which is over “the whole or substantially the
whole of the company’s assets” and has been perfected within the meaning of the Australian Personal Property Securities Act
2009 (Cth) (“PPSA”)) and (ii) if the administrator consents or the court grants leave. Any security interest existing in the
property of the company under the PPSA which, immediately before the time of appointment of the administrator, has not been
perfected in accordance with the PPSA will (subject to limited exceptions) vest in the company upon the appointment of the
administrator and accordingly will not be enforceable by the secured creditor.

An administrator is required to give immediate notice of their appointment to any secured creditor who has a security over “the
whole or substantially the whole” of the company’s assets. This creditor is permitted to enforce its security interest within the
13 day period from the commencement of the administration or when the creditor receives notice of the administrator’s
appointment. It is common for secured lenders to take security over the whole or substantially the whole of the property of
Australian companies to avail themselves of this exception, given that if the security provided does not attach to all or
substantially all of the assets of the Australian company, there is a risk at Australian law that the secured creditor may be
restricted in its ability to enforce that security by appointing a receiver during the decision period under s441A of the Australian
Corporations Act. Each general security deed granted by the Australian Guarantors provides for customary exclusions of certain
assets from the scope of that security, and if sufficient assets of the Australian Guarantors are subject to these exclusions, there
may be a risk that the security provided does not attach to substantially all assets of the Australian Guarantors, which may
restrict the ability to enforce that security during the decision period under s441A of the Australian Corporations Act.

A court, on the application of the administrator, may limit a secured creditor’s or receiver’s powers in relation to secured
property and these orders may only be made if the court is satisfied that what the administrator proposes to do during the
administration will adequately protect the secured creditor’s interests. If a receiver is not appointed before the administration
or during the decision period, an administrator may dispose of secured property in the ordinary course of business, with the
secured creditor’s consent or with the leave of the court.

**_Deed of Company Arrangement_**

A company progresses into a deed of company arrangement when a company’s creditors resolve at the second meeting of
creditors held during the administration that the company execute a deed of company arrangement. The administrators are
appointed the deed administrators unless creditors resolve to appoint other individuals. A deed of company arrangement is a
compromise agreement binding on the company, its creditors, officers and members. All unsecured creditors whose debts are
provable are bound by the deed of company arrangement even though they did not vote in favor of it.

Once the deed of company arrangement is executed, the administration terminates and the moratorium restrictions on
enforcement come to an end and are replaced by the terms of the deed of company arrangement. During the period in which
the deed of company arrangement is effective, secured creditors may enforce over the secured property provided they did not
vote in favor of the deed (or the deed does not restrict the secured creditors’ ability to enforce against the security) or they are
not prevented from enforcing their security by an order of the court. A court, on the application of the deed administrator, may
limit a secured creditor’s or receiver’s powers in relation to secured property. These orders may only be made if the court is
satisfied that the enforcement would have a material adverse effect on the purpose of the deed and the secured creditor’s
interests will be adequately protected.

The deed administrator may be tasked by the deed with realizing assets, closing down the business, restructuring the company
or pursuing litigation with a view to the payment of dividends to creditors. The deed of company arrangement may provide for
the compromise of certain creditors’ claims, payment of creditors by installment or specify that different creditors are to be
treated differently (either by extinguishment of claims or subordination). The order of distribution of proceeds to creditors will
be specified in the deed and can be different to the order which applies in liquidation. Once the tasks specified by the deed of
company arrangement are completed and proceeds distributed to creditors, the deed usually specifies that the company is
released from those debts and the deed terminates.

**_Liquidation_**

A company is placed into liquidation usually by (i) a court order (on the application of the company, a creditor, a contributory,
a director, a liquidator or provisional liquidator or a prescribed agency such as the Australian Securities and Investments
Commission); (ii) resolution of its creditors at the second meeting of creditors following a voluntary administration; or (iii) a
special resolution made voluntarily by the company’s members. A liquidator controls the company and acts as its agent. The
powers of the directors and officers are suspended and they have a duty to assist the liquidator. The company ceases to carry
on its business except to the extent the liquidator believes this is necessary for the beneficial disposal of the company or the


-----

winding up of that business. Transfers of shares in the company are void unless the liquidator gives their written consent or a
court authorizes the transfer. There is stay on court proceedings against the company and on enforcement processes except with
the leave of the court. However, the rights of secured creditors are not affected by this stay.

The purpose of a liquidation is to enable (i) the realization of all of a company’s assets (including the calling up of partly paid
shares and recoveries in respect of any voidable transactions), (ii) investigations into the company’s affairs, including
misconduct by its officers, and (iii) a proof of debt process and the rateable distribution of the proceeds among the company’s
creditors and (if there is a surplus after paying creditors) a distribution of the surplus to members. The distribution of proceeds
will be subject to statutory priority rules, including in respect of certain employee entitlements. The company’s existence will
then be brought to an end by deregistration.

Generally speaking, to the extent their security is sufficient, secured creditors stand outside the liquidation. Secured creditors
do not have to prove for their debts but may do so to the extent there is a shortfall in the amounts recovered from their security
interests or to the extent they wish to surrender their security and they have the right to enforce their security and to receive the
proceeds, subject to the rights of any prior security holders and certain payments which have priority over circulating security
interests (see below under receivership).

**_Receivership_**

Receivers are typically appointed under the terms of a security. A receiver’s appointment in respect of secured property can
continue concurrently during an administration or a liquidation of the company (subject to the exceptions above). A receiver’s
powers are usually governed by the terms of the security under which they are appointed together with statutory powers under
section 420 of the Australian Corporations Act. The receiver’s principal task is to take possession and control of the secured
property and realize the property subject to the security and pay the proceeds to the security holder. However, a receiver is an
agent of the company and still owes residual duties to the company, unsecured creditors and shareholders, as an officer of the
company. A receiver has a duty to take all reasonable care to sell secured property for not less than market value or, if there is
no market value, the best price reasonably obtainable.

Where a secured creditor holds a circulating security interest, there are claims which rank in priority to the secured creditor and
must be paid out of any enforcement proceeds before any proceeds are remitted to the secured creditor. These claims include:
(i) if the proceeds are from contracts of insurance and the insurance policy is in respect of liability to third parties, the proceeds
must be paid to the third party in respect of whom the liability was incurred; (ii) auditor’s fees and expenses for the period
between when the ASIC has refused consent to the auditor’s resignation and the date the receiver was appointed; (iii) wages,
superannuation contributions and superannuation guarantee charge payable by the company in respect of services rendered to
the company by its employees prior to the date the receiver was appointed; (iv) amounts due on or before the date the receiver
is appointed in respect of leave of absence owing to employees; (v) retrenchment payments; and (vi) amounts which have been
advanced by other parties to the company for the purpose of paying wages, superannuation contributions or payments in respect
of leave of absence or termination of employment.

A circulating security interest is a floating charge or a security interest where the secured party has given the grantor express
or implied authority to transfer the secured asset in the ordinary course of business free of the security interest or the secured
asset is an account, inventory or negotiable instrument which is not perfected by control (for the purposes of the PPSA) or the
asset is in goods and is perfected by possession.

A receiver may also have an obligation to discharge from enforcement proceeds any tax payable on any income, profits or
gains in respect of the assets sold in priority to the secured creditor.

**_Scheme of Arrangement_**

A creditors’ scheme of arrangement is a court approved arrangement or compromise which is commonly used by companies
to effect an outcome with creditors where the company has reached agreement with most of its creditors (or a particular class
of them) but does not have their unanimous agreement. If approved, the scheme will be binding on all creditors or one or more
classes of creditors (therefore ‘dragging along’ any dissenting creditors). Secured creditors can be bound by a scheme of
arrangement even if they vote against it. Schemes can be an effective method of managing a company’s exposure to its creditors
(whilst avoiding a liquidation).

Because of the time involved and the execution risk associated with developing and implementing a scheme (and the availability
of voluntary administration as an alternative), schemes generally do not find favor amongst directors seeking to address an
immediate concern about insolvent trading exposure and are less commonly used in an insolvency context in Australia.


-----

**_Limits to Enforcement of Guarantees and Security_**

The Australian Guarantors will guarantee the payment of the Notes, which will provide the holders of the Notes with a direct
claim against each Australian Guarantor. However, enforcement of the Guarantees and the security will be subject to certain
laws and generally available defenses. These laws and defenses include those that relate to corporate benefit, voidable
preference or, transaction at undervalue, unlawful assistance, unreasonable director-related transactions, breaches of directors’
duties, unconscionable conduct, economic duress, penalties or other similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights
of creditors generally which could render the security or the Guarantees limited, void or unenforceable. If any of the security
is voided, it is possible that you will be left with an unsecured claim against the Guarantor or if the Guarantees are voided you
may be left with no claim against the Guarantors and a claim solely against the Issuer.

If, on the application of a company’s liquidator, a court is satisfied that a transaction of the company is a voidable transaction,
namely an unfair preference or an uncommercial transaction, which is also an insolvent transaction, or an unreasonable directorrelated transaction, or a creditor-defeating disposition, it may make a variety of orders which are set out in section 588FF of
the Australian Corporations Act. These orders include an order releasing or discharging, wholly or partly, a debt incurred, or a
security or guarantee given, by the company under or in connection with the transaction or an order requiring a party to repay
to the company some or all of the benefits it received under the transaction. It is not necessary to establish that the directors of
the company have breached their duties to the company in any way or that the person taking the benefit of the guarantee or
security had actual or constructive notice that the transaction was an insolvent transaction.

Additionally, certain security interests over circulating assets may be void against a liquidator pursuant to section 588FJ of the
Australian Corporations Act and loans made to a company may be challenged on the basis they are unfair loans under section
588FD of the Australian Corporations Act.

There are various time periods within which a liquidator can take such action depending on the nature of the transaction being
challenged. The test for insolvency in Australia in this context is whether the relevant company is able to pay its debts as and
when they become due and payable.

_Limits to the Enforcement of “Ipso Facto” Rights_

Under the Australian Corporations Act, rights under a contract, agreement or arrangement (such as a right entitling a creditor
to terminate a contract or to accelerate a payment under a contract) arising merely because a company, among other specified
circumstances, is under administration, has appointed a managing controller or is the subject of an application under section
411 of the Australian Corporations Act or because of its financial position during such proceedings (i.e. “ipso facto rights”),
will generally not be enforceable during a prescribed moratorium period. The specified circumstances do not include a winding
up or liquidation.

These laws apply to ipso facto rights arising in respect of companies incorporated under the laws of Australia (which relevantly
would include a Relevant Australian Company) under contracts, agreements or arrangements entered into at or after July 1,
2018, subject to certain exclusions specified in the Australian Corporations Regulations.

The Australian Corporations Regulations provide that a contract, agreement or arrangement that is, or governs securities,
financial products, bonds or promissory notes will be exempt from the moratorium. Furthermore, a contract, agreement or
arrangement that is, or is directly connected with, a securities financing transaction is also excluded from the moratorium.
Accordingly, the Australian Corporations Regulations should exclude from the stay those Guarantees and security interests in
the Collateral that are granted by Relevant Australian Companies. However, as the relevant provisions of the Australian
Corporations Act and the Australian Corporations Regulations are relatively new to the insolvency regime in Australia, they
have not been the subject of extensive judicial interpretation and there remains some uncertainty as to the scope of the
application of the exclusion to guarantees or securities granted by a Relevant Australian Company, given that the relevant
contract, agreement or arrangement must be “directly connected” with a securities financing transaction. If the Australian
Corporations Regulations are determined not to exclude those Guarantees and security interests in the Collateral that are granted
by Relevant Australian Companies, this may render unenforceable in Australia any provisions of those Guarantees and security
interests that are granted to Relevant Australian Companies, conditioned solely on the occurrence of events giving rise to ipso
facto rights. Investors should seek independent advice on the implications (if any) of these laws and regulations on their
investment in the Notes.

_Other Grounds_

Under Australian law, a guarantee or security given by a company may also be set aside on a number of additional grounds.
For example, a guarantee or security may be unenforceable against a guarantor if the directors of the guarantor or grantor did


-----

not comply with their duties to act in good faith for the benefit of the guarantor or grantor and for a proper purpose in giving
the guarantee or security. The issue is particularly relevant where a company provides a guarantee or security in relation to the
obligations of another member of its corporate family, as is the case for the Guarantees and Collateral with respect to the Notes.
In determining whether there is sufficient corporate benefit to the guarantor or grantor, all relevant facts and circumstances of
the transaction need to be considered by the directors, including the benefits and detriments to the guarantor or grantor in giving
the guarantee or security, and the respective benefits to the other parties involved in the transaction. Whether a guarantee or
security entered into in breach of directors’ duties can be avoided against a party relying on the guarantee or security depends
on certain factors, including the state of knowledge of that party, and whether the party knew of or suspected the breach. Also,
under Australian law, a person is generally entitled to assume that the directors have properly performed their duties to the
company unless that person knows or suspects that they have not done so. In addition, other debts and liabilities of the
Australian Guarantors and the Issuer, such as certain employee entitlements or amounts owed to tax authorities, may rank ahead
of claims under the security.

The UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency (“Model Law”) has force of law in Australia through the enactment
of the Australian Cross Border Insolvency Act 2008 (Cth). The Model Law includes provisions for the co-operation of the
Australian courts with representatives of foreign insolvency proceedings and provides for the facilitation of those insolvency
proceedings in Australia.

**_Insolvency Proceedings_**

Certain Guarantors have their statutory seat in Belgium (each, a “Belgian Guarantor”), and provided Belgium is the territory
in which the center of such Belgian Guarantor’s main interests is situated, main insolvency proceedings may be initiated in
Belgium. Such proceedings would then be governed by Belgian law, subject to certain exemptions. Under certain
circumstances, Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015, on insolvency
proceedings (which applies to insolvency proceedings opened on or after June 26, 2017) (recast) (the “Recast Insolvency
Regulation”) and Belgian law also allow territorial bankruptcy proceedings to be opened in Belgium over the assets of
companies that are not established under Belgian law or whose center of main interest is not situated in Belgium. The effects
of those territorial bankruptcy proceedings are restricted to the assets situated in Belgium. The following is a brief description
of certain aspects of Belgian insolvency law to the extent relevant in the context of the present transaction.

Belgian insolvency laws provide mainly for three main insolvency proceedings: judicial reorganization proceedings
(gerechtelijke reorganisatie/réorganisation judiciaire), transfer under the court’s supervision (“overdracht onder gerechtelijk
_gezag/transfert sous autorité judiciaire”) and bankruptcy proceedings (faillissement/faillite). These three proceedings are_
regulated by Book XX of the Belgian Code of Economic Law (Wetboek van economisch recht/Code de droit économique), as
amended. Note that Belgian (insolvency) law offers different out of court restructuring options and also allows for liquidation
in deficit (“deficitaire vereffening/liquidation déficitaire”) but that these options will not be further discussed.

Recently an Act was adopted in the Belgian Parliament to implement the EU Restructuring Directive 2019/1023 (the “New
Insolvency Act”). The New Insolvency Act amends certain provisions of Book XX of the Code of Economic Law, in particular
with respect of restructuring proceedings. These new provisions apply to insolvency proceedings (including judicial
restructuring) opened as of September 1, 2023. Note that the New Insolvency Act distinguishes between private and public
(both in court) reorganization proceedings, no longer considers the transfer under the court’s supervision to be a judicial
reorganization and offers the possibility for companies to silently prepare for bankruptcy proceedings (the “Pre-packaged
Bankruptcy Proceeding”). These key changes are briefly discussed below.

**_Judicial Reorganization and a transfer under the court’s supervision_**

Judicial reorganization and a transfer under the court’s supervision are available to all legal entities as well as all individuals
that qualify as an enterprise (onderneming/entreprise) in the sense of Article I.1, 1° of the Belgian Code of Economic Law,
subject to certain exceptions for regulated liberal professions, credit institutions and certain other entities active on the financial
and insurance markets.

A debtor may file a petition for judicial reorganization or the transfer under the court’s supervision if the continuity of the
enterprise is at risk, whether immediately or in the future. The contents of this principle are broad and are defined in practice
by the courts. The fact that the conditions for bankruptcy are met (entailing that the debtor has the legal obligation to declare
bankruptcy under Book XX of the Belgian Code of Economic Law) does not preclude the debtor from applying for judicial
reorganization. The obligation to declare bankruptcy is suspended as from the filing of a petition for judicial reorganization. In
limited circumstances, the debtor’s creditors, third parties interested in acquiring the business or the public prosecutor may


-----

summon the debtor and seek the transfer of all or part of the debtor’s business under the court’s supervision. If the net assets
of the company have fallen under 50% of the company’s registered capital (maatschappelijk kapitaal/capital social), the
continuity of the enterprise is always presumed to be at risk (presumption that applies to procedures opened before
September 1, 2023).

The petition for judicial reorganization must indicate the measures and proposals that will be taken or made by the debtor to
carry out the reorganization. A number of documents must also be attached to the petition, including, but not limited to, an
interim balance sheet and income statement, prepared under the supervision of an auditor, an external expert accountant or a
certified tax accountant. The court may however review and, as the case may be, grant a petition to open judicial reorganization
proceedings where the debtor has been unable to provide certain required documents.

As from the filing of the petition and as long as the court overseeing a judicial reorganization or transfer under the court’s
supervision has not issued a ruling on the reorganization petition or transfer under the court’s supervision, the debtor cannot be
declared bankrupt or wound up by court order. In addition, during the period between the filing of the petition and the court’s
decision, subject to certain exceptions, none of the debtor’s assets may be disposed of by any of its creditors as a result of the
enforcement of any security interests that such creditors may hold with respect to such assets, unless the scheduled date for the
forced sale of the relevant assets falls within two months from the filing of the request for judicial restructuring and such forced
sale is not suspended by the court. The filing of the petition does not, however, have an automatic suspensory effect, except if
the court decides otherwise, if the debtor requested the opening of a judicial reorganization less than six months ago (twelve
months as from the judicial reorganizations opened after September 1, 2023).

Book XX of the Belgian Code of Economic Law provides that, within a period of 15 days as from the filing of the petition, the
court will hear the debtor and/or his or her legal counsel on the petition and will hear the report from the delegated judge. After
this hearing, the court will rule within eight days on the petition for judicial reorganization or transfer under the court’s
supervision. If the continuity of the enterprise appears to be at risk, whether immediately or in the future, the court will declare
the judicial reorganization or transfer under the court’s supervision open, allowing a temporary moratorium for a maximum
period of six months (for proceedings opened before September 1, 2023) or four months (for proceedings opened as of
September 1, 2023). At the request of the debtor (or the court appointed restructuring/liquidation expert) and pursuant to the
report issued by the delegated judge, the moratorium period can thereafter be extended if justified in light of the circumstances
(to a total maximum period of twelve months as from the initial start of the moratorium period (total maximum period of 18
months for judicial reorganization opened before September 1, 2023)).

The granting of the temporary moratorium operates as a stay on enforcement. No enforcement measures with respect to
preexisting claims (i.e. for debts incurred before the judgment opening the judicial reorganization procedure) in the moratorium
can be continued or initiated against any of the debtor’s assets from the time that the moratorium is granted until the end of the
period, with few exceptions. Furthermore, the debtor cannot be declared bankrupt or wound up by court order. During the
moratorium, no attachments can be made with regard to preexisting claims. Creditors however retain the possibility to create
legal or contractual security.

Attachments that existed prior to the moratorium retain their conservatory character, but the court may order their release,
provided that such release does not have a material adverse effect on the situation of the creditor concerned. Under certain
circumstances, attachments that existed prior to the moratorium can be continued.

If receivables are pledged by the debtor in favor of a creditor prior to the opening of the judicial reorganization proceedings,
these will not be affected by the moratorium provided that the receivables are pledged specifically to that creditor from the
moment when the pledge is created. The holder of such pledged receivables is permitted to take enforcement measures against
the estate of the initial counterparty of the debtor (such as the debtor’s customers) during the moratorium. Receivables that
form part of a pledge over business assets do not benefit from such exemption. A pledge on financial instruments and cash on
account within the meaning of the Financial Collateral Act of December 15, 2004, as amended from time to time, (the “Belgian
Financial Collateral Act”), such as shares in any Belgian Guarantor, can be enforced notwithstanding the enforcement
prohibition imposed by the moratorium. In the case of a pledge on cash held on accounts, the enforcement prohibition applies,
save in the event of payment default or if certain other conditions are met. Personal guarantees granted by third parties in favor
of the debtor’s creditors are not covered by the enforcement prohibition imposed by the moratorium, nor are the debts payable
by co-debtors, subject to certain exceptions or qualifications in respect of guarantees granted by individuals. The moratorium
also does not prevent the voluntary payment by the debtor of claims covered by the moratorium, to the extent such payment is
necessary for the continuity of the enterprise.

During the judicial reorganization and transfer under the court’s supervision, the board of directors and management of the
debtor continues (in principle) to exercise their management functions, albeit under the limited supervision of the court. Upon


-----

request of the debtor or any other interested party and to the extent it is deemed useful for reaching the aims of the
reorganization, the court may appoint an enterprise mediator (ondernemingsbemiddelaar/médiateur d’entreprise) to assist with
the reorganization of the whole or part of the assets or activities of the debtor. The court may also appoint a judicial
administrator, upon the request of any interested party or the public prosecutor, in the event of manifestly grave shortcomings
(kennelijk grove tekortkomingen/manquements graves et caractérisés) of the debtor or any of its corporate bodies threatening
the continuity of the enterprise facing difficulties or its economic activities and provided such measure can preserve such
continuity, to either exercise particular tasks indicated by the court, or to replace the debtor or any of its corporate bodies or if
the debtor’s economic activities are endangered, insofar as such measure can safeguard the continuity of the debtor. In addition,
in the event of manifestly gross negligence (kennelijk grove fout/faute grave et caractérisée), the court may, upon the request
of any interested party or the public prosecutor, appoint a temporary administrator (voorlopig bewindvoerder/administrateur
_provisoire) replacing the debtor’s corporate bodies for the duration of the moratorium and charged with the management of the_
debtor. Furthermore, upon request of any interested party or upon its own initiative, the court may decide that the company
loses all or part of the management of all or part of its assets or activities in case of important, precise and consistent indications
(gewichtige, bepaalde en met elkaar overeenstemmende aanwijzigingen/indices graves, précis et concordants) that the
conditions for bankruptcy are met.

Note that the New Insolvency Act aims at simplifying the existing regime and introducing new insolvency practitioners, ie the
restructuring expert (herstructureringsdeskundige/practicien de la reorganization) and the liquidation expert
(vereffeningsdeskundige/practicien de la liquidation) – both considered judicial administrators. As from September 1, 2023
and if the conditions are met, the court can appoint (i) a restructuring expert in order to mediate, to perform a precisely defined
task or to assist the debtor and creditors with negotiating and preparing a restructuring plan, (ii) a temporary administrator that
will take over certain or all tasks of the board of directors.

The court can end the reorganization procedure prematurely if the debtor is clearly not in a state to ensure the continuity of the
whole or part of his or her business.

The initiation of a judicial reorganization or transfer under the court’s supervision does not terminate any contracts. Contractual
provisions that provide for the early termination or acceleration of the contract upon the initiation or approval of a
reorganization procedure or transfer under the court’s supervision, and certain contractual terms such as default interest, may
not be enforceable during such a procedure. Subject to certain conditions, such enforcement prohibition does not apply to closeout netting provisions. Book XX of the Belgian Code of Economic Law provides that a creditor may not terminate a contract
on the basis of a debtor’s default that occurred prior to the granting of the moratorium if the debtor remedies such default within
a 15-day period following the notification of such default.

As an exception to the general rule of continuity of contracts, the debtor may cease performing a contract (other than labor
contracts) during the moratorium, provided that the debtor notifies the contracting party and the decision is necessary for the
reorganization or transfer. The exercise of this right does not prevent the contracting party from suspending the performance
of its own obligations.

Book XX of the Belgian Code of Economic Law provides for two types of reorganization: (i) an amicable settlement between
the debtor and some of its creditors; or (ii) a collective agreement; Book XX of the Belgian Code of Economic Law also
provides for the possibility to transfer under the court’s supervision (part of) the activities. Where initially such a transfer was
a reorganization procedure, this is no longer the case for transfers opened as of September 1, 2023. The aim of the procedure
may change during the moratorium and may also depend on the position of the court and/or third parties.

_Amicable Settlement_

The debtor may opt for an amicable agreement with at least two creditors (for proceedings opened before September 1, 2023)
or one creditor (for proceedings opened as of September 1, 2023) with a view to restructuring part or all of its assets and
activities. Parties are free to determine the content of the amicable agreement, which cannot bind third parties. If an agreement
is reached, it is filed into the insolvency register and sanctioned by the court. Certain provisions that allow creditors to challenge
transactions that occurred during the hardening period, do not apply to the amicable agreement, nor to the transactions
performed in implementation thereof.

_Collective Agreement_

In the case of a judicial reorganization by collective agreement, the creditors agree to a reorganization plan during the
reorganization procedure.


-----

For that purpose, within a period of 8 days following the ruling declaring the judicial reorganization open, the debtor must
inform each of its creditors individually of the amount of its claims against the debtor as recorded in the books of the debtor,
as well as of details regarding security interests, if applicable. Creditors with preexisting claims, as well as any other interested
party that claims to be a creditor, can challenge the amounts and the ranking of the secured claims declared by the debtor. The
court can determine the disputed amounts and the ranking of such claims on a preliminary basis for the purpose of the
reorganization procedure. In addition, the court can at any moment, in case of absolute necessity and upon request by the debtor
or the creditor, change its decision determining the amount or the ranking of the claim on the basis of new elements. If a creditor
has not challenged the amount and the ranking of its claim at least one month in advance of the date on which the creditors will
vote on the approval of the reorganization plan, the amount of its claim will remain unchanged for voting purposes as well as
for the purposes of the reorganization plan.

The debtor must use the moratorium period to complete and finalize a reorganization plan, with the assistance of the courtappointed administrator/restructuring expert, as the case may be. The plan may include measures such as the reduction or
rescheduling of liabilities and interest obligations and the conversion of debt into equity and may be based on a differentiated
treatment of certain various categories of liabilities, with certain limitations and subject to certain conditions.

The plan must be filed at least 20 days in advance of the date on which the creditors will vote on the approval of the restructuring
plan. The plan will be approved if a double majority (both in headcount and in principal amount due) of the creditors vote in
favor, it being understood that the court needs to ratify the restructuring plan prior to it taking effect. The plan will be binding
on the debtor and on all creditors (including the ones who voted against the plan, or abstained).

For judicial reorganization opened as of September 1, 2023, a new voting system will apply for restructuring plans which
involve large enterprises debtors (i.e., if during two consecutive financial years, one or more of the following thresholds have
been met: (i) annual average number of employees of 250, (ii) annual turnover excluding VAT of EUR 40,000,000, or (iii) the
balance sheet total reaches EUR 20,000,000 – this also applies if group companies together exceed one or more of the
thresholds). Under the large enterprise regime, creditors (including shareholders) can and to a certain extend must be placed in
different voting classes if their rights in a hypothetical liquidation or the rights obtained under the restructuring plan are so
dissimilar that there is no comparable position. Secured creditors and unsecured creditors must be divided in different classes.
In principle, a restructuring plan is adopted if every class has voted in favor of the restructuring plan, i.e. if a simple majority
(in amount of the claim) is obtained. The court will sanction the plan if certain conditions (including with regard to the interest
of dissenting creditors) are met. If one or more classes vote against the plan, the court can only sanction the reorganization plan
via a ‘cross-class cram down’ mechanism. This requires that additional confirmation criteria are met. SME’s may opt-in to this
new regime or choose to apply the SME voting regime, which resembles the current voting regime for collective agreement
(see above). These two regimes are therefore coexisting in Book XX of the Code of Economic Law, the legislators’ objective
being not to hinder access to reorganization procedures for small businesses.

_Transfer under the court’s supervision_

A transfer under the court’s supervision of all or part of the debtor’s enterprise can be requested by the debtor in its petition or
at a later stage in the procedure. It can be requested by the public prosecutor, by a creditor or by any party who has an interest
in acquiring, in whole or in part, the debtor’s enterprise, and the court can order such transfer in specific circumstances. The
price of the transferred assets should at least be equal to the liquidation value/assets to be transferred. In the case of comparable
offers, priority will be given to the offer guaranteeing employment by way of a social agreement.

A transfer under the court’s supervision will be organized by a judicial administrator (gerechtsmandataris/mandataire de
_justice – named liquidation expert as of September 1, 2023) appointed by the court. Following the transfer, the recourse of the_
creditors will be limited to the transfer price, subject to certain exceptions. In the case of transfer under the court’s supervision,
co-contractors of ongoing agreements can be forced to continue to perform the agreement without their consent after the transfer
(except in case of intuitu personae agreements), provided historical debts under such agreement are paid.

For transfers under the court’s supervision as of September 1, 2023, the transfer must be followed by liquidation or bankruptcy
proceedings of the debtor.

**_Private Judicial Reorganization_**

The New Insolvency Act distinguishes between private and public judicial reorganization. As of September 1, 2023, Book XX
of the Code of Economic Law will allow debtors to apply for a private judicial reorganization by amicable or collective
agreement. In such case, all proceedings will be confidential with the exception of the debtor or the practitioner, the court and
the specific creditors involved.


-----

Private judicial restructuring proceeding may be initiated by a debtor or a creditor (including shareholders) of the company.
The opening of the proceedings would only impact those parties that will be affected by the plan, which may be limited to
financial creditors for example. The court rules within eight days on the petition for private judicial reorganization. Opting for
the private judicial reorganization implies a court-appointed restructuring expert who assists all parties during the negotiations.
During a private judicial reorganization, the debtor does not automatically benefit from a stay of enforcement measures, but
under certain conditions the restructuring expert may request the court to apply a stay in respect of certain creditors.

**_Pre-packaged Bankruptcy Proceedings_**

As of September 1, 2023, a new insolvency procedure will be introduced, which is regulated in Title V/ III Book XX of the
Code of Economic Law. These (pre-pack) proceedings will allow insolvent companies to discreetly prepare for the transfer of
assets and activities under court supervision before formal bankruptcy proceedings are opened. Pre-Packaged bankruptcy
proceedings can only be initiated by the debtor. In its petition, the debtor must demonstrate that these proceedings will (i)
facilitate the liquidation of the company while achieving the highest possible distribution to the joint creditors, and (ii) preserve
jobs to the extent possible. If the court grants the debtor’s request, a liquidation expert is appointed for maximum 30 days (with
possible extension to a total of 60 days). The liquidation expert will take the lead during the preparation phase and will assess
whether the transfer of all or part of the undertaking is likely to be successful, taking into account the interests of all creditors
involved. The preparation phase is done under the supervision of a prospective supervisory judge. During the preparations, the
debtor remains in control of its assets and the day-to-day operation of its business. The debtor will however actively cooperate
in order to achieve the transfer of its assets within the shortest possible time. Following the confidential preparation procedure,
formal bankruptcy proceedings are opened.

**_Bankruptcy_**

The Belgian bankruptcy procedure is essentially governed by Book XX of the Belgian Code of Economic Law.

Bankruptcy proceedings may be initiated by the debtor, by unpaid creditors, upon the initiative of the public prosecutor’s office,
by the provisional administrator of the debtor’s assets or by the liquidator of “main insolvency proceedings” if the opening of
a territorial bankruptcy procedure is being requested. Once the court ascertains that the requirements for bankruptcy are met,
the court will establish a date by which all creditors’ claims must be submitted to the court for verification. As of
September 1, 2023, the court can be requested to pronounce the judicial dissolution (gerechtelijke ontbinding/dissolution
_judiciaire) of the debtor, provided that (i) the conditions for bankruptcy are met, and (ii) there are no significant assets available_
and the public interest requires a judicial dissolution rather than a bankruptcy.

Bankruptcy proceedings may be opened in respect of any “enterprise” as defined by Article I.1, 1° of the Code of Economic
Law (which includes notably any legal person, other than certain public law entities). Conditions for a bankruptcy order
(faillietverklaring/déclaration de faillite) are that the debtor must be in a situation of cessation of payments (staking van
_betaling/cessation de paiements) and unable to obtain further credit (wiens krediet geschokt is/ébranlement de crédit). Cessation_
of payments is generally accepted to mean that the debtor is not able to pay its debts as they fall due. Such a situation must be
persistent and not merely temporary. The mere fact that a debtor has more debts than assets does not mean that the bankruptcy
conditions are met. Companies in liquidation or that have been liquidated can be declared bankrupt up to six months after of
the closing of the liquidation. In bankruptcy, the debtor loses all authority and decision rights concerning the management of
the bankrupt’s estate. The bankruptcy receiver (curator/curateur), appointed by the court, becomes responsible for the
operation of the bankrupt’s estate and implements the sale of the debtor’s assets, the distribution of the sale proceeds to creditors
and the liquidation of the debtor. Except as to certain secured creditors, the rights of creditors in the process are limited to being
informed of the course of the bankruptcy proceedings on a regular basis by the bankruptcy receiver. Creditors may oppose the
sale of assets by bringing an action before the court in order to have a bankruptcy receiver ad hoc appointed. The bankruptcy
receiver or any interested party may request the temporary continued operation of the business, subject to certain conditions.

The bankruptcy receiver must decide whether or not to continue performance of ongoing contracts (i.e., contracts existing
before the bankruptcy order) or whether they terminate ongoing contracts unilateral if such termination is required for
administrating the bankrupt estate. Such decision cannot affect third-party rights in rem. The counterparty to an ongoing
contract may summon the bankruptcy receiver to take a decision within 15 days. If no extension of the 15-day term is agreed
upon or if the bankruptcy receiver does not make any decision, the ongoing contract is presumed to be terminated after the
expiration of the 15-day term. If the bankruptcy receiver decides not to continue the performance of an ongoing contract or if
an ongoing contract is terminated due to the expiration of the 15-day term, the counterparty to the contract may make a claim
for damages in the bankruptcy. The opening of bankruptcy proceedings as such will not cause ongoing contracts to terminate,
except


-----

(a) if the parties to an agreement have contractually agreed that the occurrence of a bankruptcy constitutes an
early termination or acceleration event; or

(b) in case of intuitu personae contracts (i.e., contracts whereby the identity of the counterparty constitutes an
essential element upon the signing of the contract). These contracts are automatically terminated as of the
bankruptcy judgment since the debtor is no longer responsible for the management of the company. Parties
can nevertheless agree to continue to perform under such contracts.

As a general rule, the enforcement rights of individual creditors are suspended upon the rendering of the court order opening
bankruptcy proceedings, and after such order is made, only the bankruptcy receiver may proceed against the debtor and
liquidate its assets. However, such suspension does not apply to a pledge on financial instruments or cash held on account
falling within the scope of the Belgian Financial Collateral Act. For creditors with claims secured by movable assets, such
suspension would normally be limited to the period until the filing of the first report of claims. Upon the request of the
bankruptcy receiver, the suspension period may be extended by a court order for up to one year as from the bankruptcy
judgment, provided that such extension is in the interests of the bankruptcy estate and if the further suspension will allow for a
realization of the assets which does not prejudice the secured creditors and provided that those secured creditors have been
given the opportunity to be heard by the court. For creditors with claims secured by immovable assets, the intervention of the
bankruptcy receiver is necessary to pursue the sale of the assets, subject to certain exceptions. The bankruptcy receiver will do
so upon an order of the court. However, a first-ranking mortgagee will be entitled to pursue the enforcement of its mortgage as
soon as the report of claims has been finalized.

If a security, such as a pledge, has been granted over assets that, at the time of opening of an insolvency proceeding, are located
in another EU Member State, the rights the creditor has under such security shall, in accordance with the EU Insolvency
Regulation, not be affected by the opening of such insolvency proceedings.

As from the date of the bankruptcy judgment, no further interest accrues against the bankrupt debtor on its unsecured debt, or
debts secured by a general privilege, such as tax debts or social security debts.

The ranking of different types of debt of the bankrupt debtor is determined on the basis of a complex set of rules. The following
is a general overview of only the main principles:

  - Estate debt: Costs and indebtedness incurred by the bankruptcy receiver during the bankruptcy proceedings, the “estate
debts,” which have a senior priority. In addition, if the bankruptcy receiver has contributed to the realization and
enforcement of secured assets, such costs will be paid to the bankruptcy receiver in priority out of the proceeds of the
realized assets before distributing the remainder to the secured creditors. Under certain conditions, debts incurred
during a judicial reorganization or transfer under the court’s supervision, will also rank as an estate debt in a subsequent
bankruptcy.

  - Security interests: Creditors that hold a security interest have a priority right over the secured asset (whether by means
of appropriation of the asset or on the proceeds upon realization).

  - Privileges: Creditors may have a particular privilege on certain or all assets (such as tax claims, claims for social
security premiums, etc.). Privileges on specific assets rank before privileges on all assets of the debtor. Certain
privileges prevail over the security interests.

  - Unsecured creditors (pari passu): Once all estate debts and creditors having the benefit of security interests and
privileges have been satisfied, the proceeds of the remaining assets will be distributed by the bankruptcy receiver
among the unsecured creditors (and secured/privileged creditors if the security/privilege did not allow them to be paid
in full) who rank pari passu (unless a creditor agreed to be subordinated).

  - Subordinated creditors will receive the remainder (if any).

Book XX of the Belgian Code of Economic Law provides that any assets, amounts and sums of distributions (such as income
generated by a new activity) received after a bankruptcy are excluded from the bankruptcy estate if their relevant cause dates
from after the bankruptcy.

**_Subsidiary Guarantee/Collateral_**

The grant of a Guarantee or Collateral by a Belgian Guarantor for the obligations of another group company must fall within
the grantor’s legal and corporate object and be for the own corporate benefit of the Belgian Guarantor and comply with any


-----

applicable financial assistance rules. If the grant of a Guarantee or Collateral does not fall within a Belgian Guarantor’s legal
and corporate object, then such Guarantee or Collateral could, upon certain conditions, be held null and void.

Corporate benefit is not a well-defined concept under Belgian law and its interpretation is left to the courts and legal authors.
The corporate benefit rules and their application in the context of granting guarantees or collateral for the benefit of a group
company are not clearly established under Belgian law and there is only limited case law on this issue.

The question of corporate benefit must be determined on a case-by-case basis by reference to the prevailing factual
circumstances. Consideration has to be given to any direct and/or indirect benefit that the company would actually derive from
the transaction and is particularly relevant for upstream or cross-stream guarantees and collateral. It is generally taught by legal
scholars that such benefit should be proportionally greater than the risk for the company resulting from the granting and/or
enforcement of the guarantee concerned. The financial support granted by the company should not exceed its financial
capabilities. Belgian case law does not offer clear guidelines on when a group transaction is within the individual group
member’s corporate benefit and when aforementioned conditions are met.

Whether or not the corporate benefit requirement is met is a matter of fact to be assessed by the management of the Belgian
Guarantor. The corporate benefit justification by the company’s management will be subject to only a “marginal review” by
the courts; in insolvency situations, however, the courts can be expected to take a more critical view. If the corporate benefit
requirement is not met, the directors or managers of the company may be held liable under civil law (i) by the company for
negligence in the management and (ii) by third parties in tort and under criminal law in certain specific circumstances (i.e.,
where the specific facts can be qualified as “abuse of company goods” (misbruik van vennootschapsgoederen/abus de bien
_sociaux)). Moreover, the guarantee or collateral could be declared null and void. Alternatively, the guarantee or collateral could_
be reduced to an amount corresponding to the corporate benefit. These rules have been seldom tested under Belgian law, and
there is only limited case law on this issue.

In order to enable Belgian subsidiaries to grant a guarantee and collateral to secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or
sister company without the risk of violating Belgian rules on corporate benefit, it is standard market practice for indentures,
credit agreements, guarantees and security documents to contain “limitation language” in relation to subsidiaries incorporated
or established in Belgium. Accordingly, the Indenture will contain such limitation language and the Guarantee of the Belgian
Guarantor(s) will be limited accordingly. Including such limitation language is, however, not conclusive in determining or
upholding the corporate benefit.

The limitation language applicable to any Belgian Guarantor which will be included in the Indenture will substantially be in
the following form:

(i) “Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Indenture, the guarantee, indemnity and other obligations
of any Belgian Guarantor under the Group’s existing senior debt document (including this Indenture, the
Existing Indentures, the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement and the Second Lien Credit Facilities Agreement
(including this Indenture) shall be limited to a maximum amount equal to the greater of: (i) an amount equal
to 75% of that Belgian Guarantor’s net assets, as calculated on the basis of its most recent audited annual
financial statements at the time the relevant demand is made and (ii) the outstanding amount of any intragroup loans, advances or facilities made to that Belgian Guarantor by any other member of the Group directly
and/or indirectly using all or part of the proceeds of the Notes (whether or not such intra-group loan is retained
by the relevant Belgian Guarantor for its own purposes or on-lent) at the time the relevant demand is made.

(ii) Any payment made by the Belgian Guarantor under this Section and any proceeds received by the Trustee
and/or the Security Agent in connection with any Transaction Security granted by such Belgian Guarantor
shall reduce the guaranteed amount determined in accordance with the formula in paragraph a) above.

(iii) For the purposes of this Section, the net assets of a Belgian Guarantor means its “netto actief”/“actif net,” as
defined in the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations, as amended or superseded.”

The grant of a guarantee or collateral by a Belgian company must also be within or serve the corporate object and statutory
purpose of the Belgian company as described in its articles of association, and the guarantee or collateral may not include any
liability that would result in unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of the Belgian Code of Companies and
Associations, as amended or superseded.


-----

**_Representative of Secured Creditors_**

Since there is no established concept of “trust” or “trustee” under the present Belgian legal system, the nature, effect and
enforceability of the duties, rights and powers of a security agent as agent or trustee for holders of the Notes in respect of
security interests such as pledges are debated and may not be effective or enforceable under Belgian law. Pursuant to Belgian
law, security is an “accessory” which must be granted to the same person to whom the secured debt is owed, except in the case
of financial collateral within the meaning of the Belgian Financial Collateral Act or collateral subject to Book III, Chapter XVII
‘Security on movable assets’ of the Belgian Civil Code, introduced by the law of 11 July 2013 on taking security on moveable
assets, as amended from time to time (“Belgian Act on Security over Movable Assets”).

Belgian pledges over financial collateral (such as the shares of the Belgian Guarantor) will be granted to the Security Agent
acting for itself and for the account of the secured parties pursuant to Article 5 of the Belgian Financial Collateral Act. Belgian
pledges over movable assets (including receivables) will be granted to the Security Agent acting for itself and for the account
of the secured parties pursuant to Article 3 of the Belgian Act on Security over Movable Assets. These provisions allow for the
creation of security over financial collateral and over movable assets, respectively, held by an agent acting as representative
for secured parties, provided that the secured parties can be determined on the basis of the security agreement.

**_Hardening Period and Fraudulent Transfer_**

In the event of bankruptcy proceedings governed by Belgian law, certain transactions that have been concluded or performed
by the debtor during the “hardening period” may be declared ineffective against third parties. In principle, the cessation of
payments (which constitutes a condition for filing for bankruptcy) is deemed to have occurred as of the date of the bankruptcy
order. The court issuing the bankruptcy order may determine, based on serious and objective indications that the cessation of
payments occurred on an earlier date. Such earlier date may not be earlier than six months before the date of the bankruptcy
order, except in the case where the bankruptcy order relates to a company that was dissolved more than six months before the
date of the bankruptcy order in circumstances suggesting an intent to defraud its creditors, in which case the date of cessation
of payments may be determined to be the date of such decision to dissolve the company. The period from the date of cessation
of payments up to the declaration of bankruptcy is referred to as the “hardening period” (verdachte periode/période suspecte).

The transactions entered into or performed during the hardening period which may be declared ineffective against third parties
and are unenforceable against the bankruptcy receiver include, among others: (i) gratuitous transactions or transactions where
the consideration received is considerably below the value of the act or asset provided by the debtor; (ii) payments for debts
that are not yet due; (iii) payments other than in cash for debts due; and (iv) new security provided for preexisting debts.

Other transactions entered into or performed during the hardening period may be declared ineffective against third parties,
provided that the counterparty was aware of the debtor’s cessation of payment.

In particular, a guarantee or security interests entered into during the hardening period may be declared ineffective against third
parties if (i) it is regarded as having been granted gratuitously or where the consideration received is considerably below the
value of the guarantee or security interests provided, (ii) the beneficiaries of the guarantee or security interests were aware of
the company’s cessation of payments or (iii) it is granted for preexisting debts.

If the Guarantee or security interests granted by a Belgian Guarantor were successfully voided (based on the above), holders
of the Notes would cease to have any claim in respect thereof and would be under an obligation to repay any amounts received
pursuant to such Guarantee or the enforcement proceeds of the security interests.

Finally, regardless of any declaration by the Enterprise Court of a hardening period, a third-party creditor may obtain a court
ruling that any act or transaction (such as a guarantee) is not enforceable against it if it can establish that the challenged act or
transaction was entered into with the fraudulent intent to adversely affect its position as an existing creditor (actio pauliana),
irrespective of its date.

**_Recognition and enforcement_**

The granting of security interests over movable or immovable, tangible or intangible, assets may be subject to validity and/or
enforceability conditions. The breach of any of such conditions may render such security interests invalid or unenforceable.
The foreclosure of security interests may be subject to formalities (e.g., judicial or non-judicial consent or, for movable assets
(such as receivables), prior notification to the debtor and certain interested parties) and may be time-consuming in the event
that the foreclosure takes place under judicial control or in the event of a legal dispute, in which case any interested party may
request a judge at any moment in time to intervene, and such request would suspend the foreclosure. For certain assets, courts
may condition the enforcement of a security interest and/or guarantee upon the evidence that the creditor has a final and


-----

undisputed claim triggering the foreclosure of the security interest and/or guarantee. Enforcement of security over movable
assets and financial collateral can be out of court; however, any interested party may request an a posteriori control from the
court with respect to such enforcement. In addition, security interests over movable assets must be enforced in good faith and
in an economically reasonable manner. Enforcement of security interests and/or guarantees may be hindered by conflict of law
and/or conflict of jurisdiction issues and may not breach any public policy provision and/or mandatory legal provisions. Courts
may require a sworn translation in French or Dutch of the English documents which they may review.

**England and Wales**

**_England and Wales_**

The Issuer and certain Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of England and Wales and, in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the Indenture and the Notes, are obliged to grant certain fixed and floating security interests in favor of Barclays
Bank PLC in its capacity as Security Agent in respect of the Notes and its Guarantee (the “English Guarantors”).

**_Applicable legal framework and jurisdiction of the English courts_**

While the UK was a member state of the EU, insolvency processes opened in the UK were subject to both EU and applicable
UK domestic legislation. Following the UK’s departure from the EU on 31 January 2020 and the expiry of the subsequent
transition period (the “Transition Period”) on 31 December 2020, in accordance with the European Union (Withdrawal) Act
2018 (as amended by the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020) EU law as directly applicable in the UK at the
end of the Transition Period (subject to certain exceptions) was transposed into UK domestic law subject to significant
amendments. The Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (SI 2019/146) (as amended) effected key amendments
to both EU insolvency laws previously directly applicable in the UK, including the EC Regulation No. 2015/848 on Insolvency
Proceedings (the “Recast Insolvency Regulation”), and domestic insolvency laws, including the Insolvency Act 1986 (the
“Insolvency Act”), the Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016 (SI 2016/1024) (the “Insolvency Rules”) and the CrossBorder Insolvency Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/1030) (the “Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations”).

Unless insolvency proceedings or certain related proceedings were opened prior to the expiry of the Transition Period, in which
case the unmodified Recast Insolvency Regulation and related EU insolvency legislation govern the proceedings, insolvency
proceedings with respect to the English Guarantors would likely proceed under, and be governed by, English insolvency laws
in force at the time of commencement of the relevant proceedings. However, to the extent that an English Guarantor has its
centre of main interests (“COMI”) in a member state of the EU, insolvency proceedings for that company may, pursuant to the
Recast Insolvency Regulation and subject to certain exceptions, be opened in the relevant EU member state and be subject to
the laws of that EU member state (see “—European Union” below). In addition, pursuant to the Cross-Border Insolvency
Regulations, which implement the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency in Great Britain, certain foreign courts
may have jurisdiction to oversee insolvency proceedings of any English Guarantor which has its COMI or an “establishment”
(being a place of operations where it carries out a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets or services
which differs from the definition in the Recast Insolvency Regulation) in such foreign jurisdiction.

Although the scope of the English courts’ jurisdiction varies for the different insolvency proceedings available in England and
Wales, English courts generally have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings in respect of any company which has its
COMI in the UK or which has its COMI in an EU member state (other than Denmark) and an “establishment” in the UK. An
“establishment” is defined in the same way as under the Recast Insolvency Regulation (see “—European Union” below). While
this allows English courts to assume jurisdiction over certain foreign companies in respect of certain insolvency proceedings,
the efficacy of such proceedings will significantly depend on the likelihood and extent of subsequent recognition of such
proceedings in relevant other jurisdictions (see “—Cross-border recognition of English insolvency and restructuring
_proceedings” below)._

English insolvency law is different to the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions with which investors may be familiar.
In the event that the English Guarantors experience financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome
of insolvency or similar proceedings. The obligations under the Notes are guaranteed by the Guarantees and secured by security
interests over the Collateral. English insolvency laws and other limitations could limit the enforceability of the payment
obligations of the Issuer, in respect of the principal, interest and other amounts owing by the Issuer, a Guarantee against the
English Guarantors and the enforceability of security interests over the Collateral.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of English insolvency law relating to certain limitations on English
guarantees and the security interests over the Collateral. The application of these laws could adversely affect investors, their
ability to enforce their rights for the payment of the principal, interest and other amounts owing by the Issuer, under the English


-----

Guarantee and/or the Collateral securing the Notes and the English Guarantee and therefore may limit the amounts that investors
may receive in an insolvency of the English Guarantors.

**_Fixed versus floating charges_**

The Notes and the Guarantees benefit from fixed and floating charge security over certain Collateral owned by certain of the
English Guarantors.

There are a number of ways in which fixed charge security has an advantage over floating charge security.

Until floating charge security crystallizes, a company is entitled to deal with assets that are subject to floating charge security
in the ordinary course of business, meaning that such assets can be effectively disposed of by the charging company so as to
give a third party good title to the assets free of the floating charge. Crystallisation of floating charge security occurs in
accordance with the triggers set out in the relevant security document or upon the occurrence of certain insolvency related
events under English common law.

On an insolvency of a charging company: (a) a fixed charge, even if created after the date of a floating charge, may have priority
as against a floating charge over the same charged assets (provided that the floating charge has not crystallized at the time the
fixed charge was granted and there were no restrictions on the creation of such security which the fixed charge holder was
aware of); (b) general costs and expenses (including the remuneration of the insolvency officeholders and the costs of
continuing to operate the business of the charging company while in administration) properly incurred in an insolvency process
are generally payable out of the assets of the charging company (including the assets (including cash) that are the subject of the
floating charge) and insolvency office-holders appointed to a charging company can convert floating charge assets to cash by
selling them and use such cash to meet such general costs and expenses in priority to floating charge claims to the extent that
the value of the charging company’s unsecured assets is not sufficient to cover such costs and expenses in full; (c) an
administrator may dispose of or take action relating to property subject to a floating charge without the prior consent of the
charge holder or court but the floating charge holder retains the same priority in respect of the proceeds from the disposal of
the assets subject to the floating charge; (d) where the floating charge is not created or otherwise arising under a “financial
collateral arrangement” (generally, a charge over cash or financial instruments such as shares, bonds or tradeable capital market
debt instruments and credit claims) under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (as amended) (the
“Financial Collateral Regulations”), assets subject to floating charge security are subject to the claims of certain preferential
creditors (such as certain tax claims owed to HMRC (including claims for value added tax and certain employment taxes),
employee salary claims (up to a cap per employee), employee holiday claims and certain unpaid pension contributions) where
the floating charge is not a security financial collateral arrangement and subject to the ring-fencing of the Prescribed Part for
unsecured creditors(see “—Priority on insolvency” below); and (e) there are particular insolvency “clawback” risks in relation
to floating charge security (see “ – Avoidance of Transactions” below). A floating charge cannot crystallize upon or during the
period that the charging company is subject to a Part A1 Moratorium (as defined below), and charge holders are prevented
from imposing restrictions on the disposal of the charged assets for the duration of the Part A1 moratorium (see “ –
_Moratoriums” below)._

There is a possibility under English law that a court could find that some or all of the fixed security interests expressed to be
created by the security documents governed by English law properly take effect as floating charges as the description given to
them as fixed charges is not determinative. Whether the purported fixed security interests will be upheld as fixed security
interests rather than floating security interests will depend, among other things, on whether the secured party has the requisite
degree of control over the chargor’s ability to deal in the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such
control is exercised by the security holder in practice. Where the chargor is free to deal with the assets that are the subject of a
purported fixed charge in its discretion and without the consent of the chargee, the court would be likely to hold that the security
interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge.

**_Administration_**

English insolvency statutes empower English courts to make an administration order in respect of any company within their
general jurisdiction (see “—Applicable legal framework and jurisdiction of the English courts” above), any company
incorporated in England and Wales, Scotland or a state in the EEA (“EEA State”), any company (irrespective of its country of
incorporation) with its COMI in the UK or an EU member state (other than Denmark) and upon request from courts in other
parts of the UK or certain other countries and territories. In each case, without limitation and subject to specific conditions, an
administration order can be made if the court is satisfied that (a) the relevant company is or is likely to become “unable to pay
its debts” and (b) the administration order is reasonably likely to achieve the purpose of administration.


-----

A company is unable to pay its debts if it is insolvent on a “cash flow” basis (unable to pay its debts as they fall due) or if it is
insolvent on a “balance sheet” basis (the value of the company’s assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into
account its contingent and prospective liabilities), as per Section 123 of the Insolvency Act. Such insolvency is presumed if,
among other matters, the company fails either to satisfy a creditor’s statutory demand for a debt exceeding £750 within 21 days
of service or to satisfy in full or in part a judgment debt (or similar court order). Without limitation and subject to specific
conditions, an English company, the directors of such company or the holder of a qualifying floating charge (for further detail
on what constitutes a qualifying floating charge, see “—Administrative Receivership” below) where the floating charge has
become enforceable, may also appoint an administrator through an out of court process, subject to certain exceptions pursuant
to the Insolvency Act, and different procedures apply according to the identity of the appointer.

The purpose of an administration is comprised of three parts that must be looked at successively: rescuing the company as a
going concern or, if that is not reasonably practicable, achieving a better result for the company’s creditors as a whole than
would be likely upon immediate liquidation or, if neither of those objectives is reasonably practicable, and the interests of the
creditors as a whole are not unnecessarily harmed thereby, realizing property to make a distribution to one or more secured or
preferential creditors. The order of priority which applies to any distribution to creditors is set out below (see “—Onset of
_insolvency” below)._

An administrator must attempt to achieve the objectives of administration in order, unless he thinks it is not reasonably
practicable to achieve the primary objective, or that the secondary objective would achieve a better result for the company’s
creditors as a whole. Therefore, the administrator cannot pursue the third objective unless he thinks either the first or the second
objective is unachievable and that it will not unnecessarily harm the interests of the creditors of the company as a whole to
pursue the third objective.

In addition, certain rights of creditors, including secured creditors, are curtailed in an administration. Upon the appointment of
an administrator, any existing Part A1 Moratorium (see “—Moratoriums” below) will come to an end and a statutory
moratorium is imposed such that no step may be taken to enforce security or a guarantee over the company’s property except
with the consent of the administrator or the permission of the court (although a demand for payment could be made under a
guarantee granted by the company). The same requirements for consent or permission apply to the institution or continuation
of legal process (including legal proceedings, execution, distress and diligence) against the company or property of the
company. In either case, a court will consider discretionary factors in determining any application for leave in light of the
hierarchy of statutory objectives of administration described above.

However, certain creditors of a company in administration may, in certain defined circumstances, be able to realize their
security over certain of that company’s property notwithstanding the statutory moratorium. This is by virtue of the
disapplication of the moratorium in relation to any security interest created or otherwise arising under “financial collateral
agreement” (generally, a charge over cash or financial instruments, such as shares, bonds or tradeable capital market debt
instruments and credit claims) under the Financial Collateral Regulations.

Accordingly, if the English Guarantors were to enter into administration, the Notes, the English Guarantee and the Collateral,
as applicable, could not be enforced while the relevant company was in administration without the permission of the court or
consent of the administrator. There can be no assurance that the Security Agent, as applicable, would obtain such permission
of the court or consent of the administrator.

**_Qualifying floating charge_**

If a company grants a “qualifying floating charge” to a party for the purposes of English insolvency law, that party will be able
to appoint an administrator using the out of court process upon the qualifying floating charge becoming enforceable (see “—
_Administration” above). That party will also (in limited circumstances) be able to appoint an administrative receiver (see “—_
_Administrative Receivership” below)._

In order to constitute a qualifying floating charge, the floating charge must be created by an instrument which: (a) states that
the relevant statutory provision applies to it (paragraph 14 of Schedule B1 of the Insolvency Act); (b) purports to empower the
holder to appoint an administrator of the company; or (c) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrative receiver
within the meaning given by Section 29(2) of the Insolvency Act. A party will be the holder of a qualifying floating charge if
such floating charge security, together (if necessary) with other forms of security, relates to the whole or substantially the whole
of the property of the relevant company and at least one such security interest is a qualifying floating charge. Please note that
it is a matter of fact whether the extent of the security granted relates to ‘the whole or substantially the whole’ of the property
of a company and there is no statutory guidance as to what percentage of a company’s assets should be charged to satisfy this
test.


-----

**_Administrative Receivership_**

Administrative receivership as a creditor remedy has been largely abolished and is only available in very limited circumstances.
The ability to appoint an administrative receiver only applies to holders of a qualifying floating charge where either the security
document granting such charge pre-dates September 15, 2003 or where it falls within one of the exceptions under the Insolvency
Act (as amended by the Enterprise Act 2002). The most relevant exception to the prohibition on the appointment of an
administrative receiver is the exception relating to “capital market arrangements” (as defined in the Insolvency Act), which
may apply if the issue of the Notes creates a debt of at least £50 million for the relevant English company during the life of the
arrangement and the arrangement involves the issue of a “capital markets investment” (which is defined in the Insolvency Act,
and generally includes rated, listed or traded debt instruments, and debt instruments designed to be rated, listed or traded). An
administrative receiver cannot be appointed to a company which is subject to a Part A1 Moratorium (see “—Moratoriums”
below).

If an administrative receiver has been appointed, an administrator can only be appointed by the court (and not by the company,
its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge using the out of court procedure) and then only if the person who
appointed the administrative receiver consents or the court considers that the security pursuant to which the administrative
receiver was appointed is capable of challenge as a transaction at an undervalue, a preference or an invalid floating charge (see
“—Transactions at an undervalue”, “—Preference” and “—Avoidance of floating charges” below, respectively). If an
administrator is appointed, any administrative receiver will vacate office, and any receiver of part of the company’s property
must resign if required to do so by the administrator.

**_Fixed charge receivership_**

A fixed charge receiver (as opposed to an administrative receiver, who is appointed under certain floating charges – see
“Administrative receivership” above) may be appointed over some or all of the assets secured by a fixed charge in accordance
with the terms of a security document creating a fixed charge or (in limited circumstances) pursuant to statute under the Law
of Property Act 1925, although it is standard market practice to augment the powers of any receiver appointed through the
relevant security document.

If appointed under the terms of a security agreement, grounds for appointment under the terms of the charge (such as a default)
must exist and the charging company must have failed to satisfy the demand made for an appointment to take place. A
receivership is not a process pursuant to English insolvency laws as such and a fixed charge receivership can be run in parallel
to a liquidation or an administration. However, an administrator may require a fixed charge receiver to vacate office unless that
fixed charge receiver was appointed under a charge created or otherwise arising under a “financial collateral arrangement”, as
per Regulation 8(4) of the Financial Collateral Regulations (see “—Administration” above).

The primary duty of a fixed charge receiver is to realise the assets over which (s)he is appointed, meaning (s)he owes an overriding duty of care to the appointor, although certain limited duties are also owed to the chargor. This contrasts with the duty
of an administrator, who performs his/her duties in the interests of a company’s creditors as a whole. In other words,
receivership is a proprietary remedy whereas administration is a collective procedure. In realising the charged assets, the
receiver will need to take reasonable care to obtain the best price obtainable in the circumstances. In doing so, the fixed charge
receiver will be entitled to a statutory indemnity in respect of any liabilities from the realisations made of the assets of the
company (and may also have the benefit of a contractual indemnity from the appointor).

To the extent the receiver has been appointed under a crystallised floating charge, amounts will be deducted from the proceeds
of the realisation of the charged assets to pay the Prescribed Part and any preferential creditors (see “—Prescribed Part” below).

**_Liquidation/Winding-Up_**

Liquidation is a company dissolution procedure under which the assets of a company are realized and distributed by the
liquidator to creditors in the statutory order of priority prescribed by the Insolvency Act (see “—Priority on insolvency” below).
There are two forms of winding-up: (a) compulsory liquidation, by order of the court and (b) members’ voluntary liquidation
or creditors’ voluntary liquidation, in each case by resolution of the company’s members. The difference between the two
voluntary proceedings is the solvency of the company in question; in a members’ voluntary liquidation, the directors of the
company swear a statutory declaration as to the company’s solvency over the following 12 months whereas the primary ground
for the compulsory winding-up of an insolvent company is that it is unable to pay its debts (as defined in Section 123 of the
Insolvency Act – see “—Administration” above). Note that while a creditor’s voluntary liquidation (other than as an exit from
administration) is initiated by a resolution of the members, not the creditors, but once in place is subject to some degree of
control by the creditors. Whereas compulsory liquidation and creditors’ voluntary liquidation proceedings are available to
foreign companies with sufficient nexus to the UK in addition to companies within the English courts’ general jurisdiction (see


-----

“—Applicable legal framework and jurisdiction of the English courts” above), members’ voluntary liquidation proceedings are
only available to companies registered in England, Wales or Scotland.

The effect of a compulsory winding-up differs in a number of respects from that of a voluntary winding-up. In a compulsory
winding-up, under Section 127 of the Insolvency Act, any disposition of the relevant company’s property made after the
commencement of the winding-up is, unless sanctioned by the court, void. Importantly, the court order which formalizes the
commencement of the winding-up has retrospective effect so that the winding-up is deemed to have commenced on the date of
the winding-up petition, not the date of the court order. This means that Section 127 applies with, effectively, retrospective
effect from the deemed winding-up date. However, Section 127 will not apply to any property or security interest subject to a
disposition or created or otherwise arising under a “financial collateral arrangement” under the Financial Collateral Regulations
and will not prevent a close-out netting provision taking effect in accordance with its terms. Subject to certain exceptions, when
an order is made for the winding-up of a company by the court, any existing Part A1 Moratorium (see “—Moratoriums” below)
will come to an end and a stay of all proceedings against the company will be imposed. No legal action may be continued or
commenced against the company without permission of the court and subject to such terms as the court may impose although
there is no freeze on the enforcement of security.

In the context of a voluntary winding-up however, there is no equivalent to the retrospective effect of a winding-up order; the
winding-up commences on the passing of the member’s resolution to wind up. As a result, there is no equivalent of Section 127
of the Insolvency Act. There is also no automatic stay in the case of a voluntary winding-up—it is for the liquidator, or any
creditor or shareholder of the company, to apply for a stay. This is important because it means secured creditors can go ahead
and enforce their security.

**_Scheme of Arrangement_**

Although it is not an insolvency proceeding, pursuant to Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006 (“Companies Act”), the English
courts have jurisdiction to sanction a scheme of arrangement that effects a compromise of a company’s liabilities between a
company and its creditors (or any class of its creditors) or its members (or any class of its members). An English Guarantor
may be able to propose a scheme in respect of its financial liabilities.

In addition, a foreign Guarantor which (i) is liable to be wound up under the Insolvency Act; and (ii) has a “sufficient
connection” to England and Wales could also propose a scheme. In practice, a foreign company is likely to satisfy the first limb
of this test and the second limb has been found to be satisfied where, amongst other things, the company’s COMI is in England
and Wales, the company’s finance documents are English law-governed, or the company’s finance documents have been
amended in accordance with their terms to be governed by English law. Ultimately, each case will be considered on its particular
facts and circumstances so previous cases will not necessarily determine whether or not any of the grounds of the second limb
are satisfied in the present case.

Before the court considers whether or not to sanction a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors will vote on the proposed
compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes, depending on the rights of
such creditors that will be affected by the proposed scheme and any new rights that such creditors are given under the scheme.
Such compromise can be proposed by the company, its creditors, its members or an appointed administrator or liquidator. If a
majority in number representing 75% or more by value of those creditors present and voting at the meeting(s) of each class of
creditors vote in favor of the proposed scheme, irrespective of the terms and approved thresholds contained in the finance
documents, then that scheme will (subject to the sanction of the court) be binding on all affected creditors, including those
affected creditors who did not participate in the vote and those who voted against the scheme. The scheme then needs to be
sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing where the court will review the fairness of the scheme and consider whether it is
reasonable. The court has discretion as to whether to sanction the scheme as approved, make an order conditional upon
modifications being made to the scheme or reject the scheme. In exercising its discretion to sanction a scheme of a foreign
Guarantor, the court will need to be satisfied that the scheme of arrangement would have substantial effect in the jurisdictions
in which the company has its main assets or operations, in the jurisdictions of any other obligors of the debt and under the
governing law the affected debt documents (if not English law). This is typically achieved by providing expert evidence that
the scheme of arrangement (or its effect) is likely to be recognised in such jurisdictions. Once sanctioned, the scheme of
arrangement binds all affected stakeholders whose rights will be as set out in the scheme of arrangement, which shall be
effective (in accordance with its terms) upon delivery of the court’s order sanctioning the scheme of arrangement to the
Registrar of Companies.

Unlike an administration proceeding, the commencement of a scheme of arrangement does not automatically trigger a
moratorium of claims or proceedings. A company may, however, propose a scheme of arrangement while subject to a Part A1
Moratorium which may remain in place until sanctioning of the scheme (see “—Moratoriums” below).


-----

**_Restructuring plan_**

Like a scheme of arrangement, a restructuring plan is a procedure under the Companies Act, namely Part 26A thereof, which
allows the English courts to effect a compromise of a company’s liabilities between a company and its creditors (or any class
of its creditors) or its members (or any class of its members), but with the added possibility of a ‘cross-class cram-down’. While
generally available to the same domestic and foreign companies as schemes of arrangement, a company seeking to enter into a
restructuring plan process must show that (a) it has encountered, or is likely to encounter, financial difficulties that are affecting,
or will or may affect, its ability to carry on business as a going concern, and (b) a compromise or arrangement has been proposed
between the company and its creditors (or any class of them) whose purpose it is to eliminate, reduce or prevent, or mitigate
the effect of, any of those financial difficulties. The Secretary of State has been given express power to exclude companies
providing financial services and certain other companies from being able to pursue a restructuring plan although these powers
have to date not been exercised.

A restructuring plan may be proposed by the debtor company, any creditor of the company or any liquidator or administrator
appointed to the company. As with a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors will vote on the proposed compromise or
arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes depending on the rights of such creditors which
will be affected by the proposed restructuring plan and any new rights that such creditors are given under the restructuring plan.

A restructuring plan will be deemed to be approved if at least 75% in value of the creditors present and voting at the meeting
of at least one class of creditors vote in favour of the proposed compromise. There is no requirement for the approving creditors
to constitute a majority in number of those creditors present and voting, and there is crucially no requirement for each and
every voting class to approve of the plan, provided that the court is satisfied that (a) none of the members of a dissenting class
would be any worse off if the restructuring plan were to be sanctioned than they would be in the event of the ‘relevant
alternative’ and (b) the restructuring plan was approved by at least one class of creditors who would receive a payment or have
a genuine economic interest in the company in the event of the ‘relevant alternative’. The ‘relevant alternative’ for the purposes
of this assessment is whatever the court considers would be most likely to occur in relation to the company if the restructuring
plan were not sanctioned. By virtue of these mechanics, the restructuring plan process provides for the possibility of a ‘crossclass cram-down’, meaning the courts may sanction a restructuring plan even if one or more classes of affected creditors do
not vote in favour of the restructuring plan, effectively allowing the vote of one class of stakeholders to bind other classes.

Following approval of the restructuring plan at the creditor meeting(s), the restructuring plan needs to be sanctioned by the
court at a sanction hearing where the court will review whether the applicable statutory conditions have been met and may also
consider whether the restructuring plan is just and equitable. The court has discretion as to whether to sanction the restructuring
plan as approved, make an order conditional upon modifications being made or refuse to sanction the restructuring plan. Once
sanctioned, the restructuring plan binds all affected stakeholders whose rights will be as set out in the restructuring plan, which
shall be effective (in accordance with its terms) upon delivery of the court’s order sanctioning the restructuring plan to the
Registrar of Companies.

As with schemes of arrangement, the commencement of a restructuring plan process does not automatically trigger a
moratorium of claims or proceedings but a company may propose a restructuring plan while subject to a Part A1 Moratorium.
Any such Part A1 Moratorium may remain in place until sanctioning of the restructuring plan, subject to the satisfaction of the
statutory requirements for the Part A1 Moratorium to be extended, where applicable.

**_Priority on insolvency_**

One of the primary functions of liquidation (and, where the company cannot be rescued as a going concern, one of the possible
functions of administration) under English law is to realize the assets of the insolvent company and to distribute the cash
realizations made from those assets to its creditors.

Under the Insolvency Act and in accordance with the Insolvency Rules, creditors are placed into different classes and, with the
exceptions and adjustments noted below, the proceeds from the realization of the insolvent company’s property is applied in
descending order of priority, as set out below. With the exception of the Prescribed Part (as defined below), distributions
generally cannot be made to a class of creditors until the claims of the creditors in a prior ranking class have been paid in full.
Unless creditors have agreed otherwise, distributions are made on a _pari passu_ basis, that is, the assets are distributed in
proportion to the debts due to each creditor within a class.

Contractual setting-off arrangements entered into after a company enters liquidation or administration are only respected to the
extent they fall within the definition of “mutual dealing” as applied by the mandatory insolvency set-off regime. This regime
sees an account being taken of what is due from each party to the other in respect of their mutual dealings, and only the resulting

net balance is either provable by the creditor in the administration or liquidation of the company (if amounts remain due to the
creditor) or, conversely, is payable by the creditor to the company (if amounts remain due to the company).

The general priority on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority):

  - _First ranking: holders of fixed charge security and creditors with a proprietary interest in specific assets in the_
possession (but not full legal and beneficial ownership) of the debtor but only to the extent the realizations from those
secured assets or with respect to the asset in which they have a proprietary interest account for the relevant
indebtedness;

  - _Second ranking: expenses of the insolvent estate incurred during the relevant insolvency proceedings, including the_
costs of an administrator or liquidator (there are statutory provisions setting out the order of priority in which expenses
are paid);

  - _Third ranking: ordinary and secondary preferential creditors._

Ordinary preferential debts include (but are not limited to) debts owed by the insolvent company in relation to:
(a) contributions to occupational and state pension schemes; (b) wages and salaries of employees for work done in the
four months before the insolvency date, up to a maximum of £800 per person; and (c) holiday pay due to any employee
whose contract has been terminated, whether the termination takes place before or after the date of insolvency. As
between one another, ordinary preferential debts rank equally;

Secondary preferential debts rank for payment after the discharge of ordinary preferential debts and include claims by
HMRC in respect of certain taxes including VAT, PAYE income tax, employee NI contributions, student loan
repayments and Construction Industry Scheme deductions (but excluding corporation tax and employer NI
contributions) which are held by the company on behalf of employees, and customers. As between one another,
secondary preferential debts rank equally;

  - _Fourth ranking: holders of floating charge security, to the extent of the realizations from those secured assets,_
according to the priority of their security. This would include any floating charge that was stated to be a fixed charge
in the document that created it but which, on a proper interpretation, was rendered a floating charge. However, before
distributing asset realizations to the holders of floating charges, the Prescribed Part (as defined below) must, subject
to certain exceptions, be set aside for distribution to unsecured creditors;

  - _Fifth ranking:_

    - firstly, provable debts of unsecured creditors and (to the extent of any unsecured shortfall) any secured creditor,
in each case including accrued and unpaid interest on those debts up to the date of commencement of the relevant
insolvency proceedings. To pay the secured creditors any unsecured shortfall, the insolvency officeholder can
only use realizations from unsecured assets, as secured creditors are not entitled to any distribution from the
Prescribed Part unless the Prescribed Part is sufficient to pay out all unsecured creditors;

    - secondly, interest on the company’s debts (at the higher of the applicable contractual rate and the official rate
determined in accordance with the Judgments Act 1838 (currently 8% per annum)) in respect of any period after
the commencement of liquidation, or after the commencement of any administration which had been converted
into a distributing administration. However, in the case of interest accruing on amounts due under the Notes or
the Guarantees, such interest due to the holders of the Notes may, if there are sufficient realizations from the
secured assets, be discharged out of such security recoveries; and

    - thirdly, non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the categories above and therefore
are only recovered in the (unusual) event that all categories above are fully paid. This however does not include
“currency conversion” claims following the English Supreme Court Lehman Brothers ruling dated 17 May 2017;
and

  - _Sixth ranking: shareholders. If after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full, any remaining funds exist, these_
will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent company.

Subject to the above order of priority, subordinated creditors are ranked according to the terms of the subordination language
in the relevant documentation.


-----

Where the debtor company enters into administration or winding-up proceedings within 12 weeks of the end of a Part A1
Moratorium, certain moratorium-related debts will benefit from ‘super priority’ and will rank immediately following the first
ranking debts, and ahead of the second ranking debts, set out above. The relevant debts comprise prescribed fees and expenses
of any official receiver, debts incurred during the Part A1 Moratorium and priority pre-moratorium debts (see “—Moratoriums”
below).

**_Prescribed Part_**

An insolvency practitioner of the company (e.g. administrator, administrative receiver or liquidator) will generally be required
to ring-fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of enforcement of floating charge security for the benefit of unsecured
creditors (after making full provision for preferential creditors and expenses out of floating charge realizations) (the “Prescribed
Part”). Under current law, this ring-fence applies to 50% of the first £10,000 of floating charge realizations and 20% of the
remainder over £10,000, with a maximum aggregate cap of £800,000 (except where the company’s net property is available to
be distributed to the holder of a first-ranking floating charge created before 6 April 2020, in which case the maximum aggregate
cap is £600,000). The Prescribed Part must be made available to unsecured creditors unless the cost of doing so would be
disproportionate to the resulting benefit to creditors.

The requirement of the insolvency officeholder to set aside a Prescribed Part will not apply to any charge created or otherwise
arising under a financial collateral arrangement under the Financial Collateral Regulations.

**_Avoidance of Transactions_**

There are circumstances under English insolvency law in which the granting by an English company of security and/or
guarantees can be challenged. In most cases, this will only arise if the company is placed into administration or liquidation
within a specified period after the relevant act. Therefore, if during the specified period an administrator or liquidator is
appointed to an English company, the administrator or liquidator may challenge the validity of the security or guarantee given
by such company, or certain transactions entered into by the company.

The Issuer cannot be certain that, in the event that the onset of an English company’s insolvency (as described below) is within
any of the requisite time periods, the grant of a security interest and/or guarantee in respect of the relevant Notes would not be
challenged or that a court would uphold the transaction as valid.

_Onset of insolvency_

The date of the onset of insolvency, for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue, preferences and invalid floating charges
(as discussed below), depends on the insolvency procedure in question.

In administration, the onset of insolvency is the date on which: (a) the court application for an administration order is issued;
(b) the notice of intention to appoint an administrator is filed at court; or (c) otherwise, the date on which the appointment of
an administrator takes effect.

In a compulsory liquidation the onset of insolvency is the date the winding-up petition is presented to court, whereas in a
voluntary liquidation it is the date the company passes a winding-up resolution. Where liquidation follows administration, the
onset of insolvency will be the same as the initial administration.

_Connected Persons_

If the given transaction at an undervalue, preference, or invalid floating charge has been entered into by the company with a
“connected person,” then particular specified time periods and presumptions will apply to any challenge by an administrator or
liquidator (as set out below).

A “connected person” of a company granting a security interest or guarantee for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue,
preferences or invalid floating charges is a party who is: (a) a director of the company; (b) a shadow director; (c) an associate
of such director or shadow director; or (d) an associate of the relevant company.

A party is associated with an individual if they are: (a) a relative of the individual; (b) the individual’s husband, wife or civil
partner; (c) a relative of the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner; (d) the husband, wife or civil partner of a relative of the
individual; or (e) the husband, wife or civil partner of a relative of the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner.

A party is associated with a company if they are employed by that company.


-----

A company is associated with another company if (a) the same person has control of both companies; (b) a person has control
of one and persons who are his associates, or he and persons who are his associates, have control of the other; or (c) if a group
of two or more persons has control of each company, and the groups either consist of the same persons or could be regarded as
consisting of the same persons by treating (in one or more cases) a member of either group as replaced by a person of whom
he is an associate.

The potential grounds for challenge available under the English insolvency legislation that may apply to any security interest
or guarantee granted by an English company include the following described below.

_Transactions at an Undervalue_

Under section 238 of the Insolvency Act, a liquidator or administrator of an English company could apply to the court for an
order to set aside a transaction, for example the creation of a security interest or a guarantee, (or give such other relief as the
court thinks fit for restoring the position to what it otherwise would have been) where the creation of such security interest or
guarantee constituted a transaction at an undervalue.

It will only be a transaction at an undervalue if, at the time of the transaction or as a consequence of the transaction, the English
company is unable to pay its debts or becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency Act). The
transaction can be challenged if the English company enters into liquidation or administration proceedings within a period of
two years ending with the onset of insolvency from the date of the transaction. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or
liquidator to show that the company was unable to pay its debts unless a beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person
(see “—Connected persons” above), in which case there is a presumption of insolvency and the connected person must
demonstrate that the company was not unable to pay its debts at the time of the transaction or became unable to do so as a
consequence of the transaction.

A transaction may be set aside as a transaction at an undervalue if the company made a gift to a person, if the company received
no consideration or if the company received consideration of significantly less value, in money or money’s worth, than the
consideration given by such company.

However, a court will generally not intervene if it is satisfied that the company entered into the transaction in good faith and
for the purpose of carrying on its business and that, at the time it did so, there were reasonable grounds for believing the
transaction would benefit it.

If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction at an undervalue, the court can make such order as it thinks fit to
restore the company to the position it would have been in had it not entered into the transaction, which may include reducing
payments due under or setting aside security interests or guarantees. An order by the court for a transaction at an undervalue
may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person whether or not they are the person with whom the company
entered into the transaction, but such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person
other than the company in good faith and for value or prejudice any interest deriving from such an interest, and will not require
a person who received a benefit from the transaction in good faith and for value to pay a sum to the liquidator or administrator
of the company, except where the person was a party to the transaction.

_Preference_

Under section 239 of the Insolvency Act, a liquidator or administrator of an English company could apply to the court for an
order to set aside a transaction, for example payments, the creation of a security interest or a guarantee, (or give such other
relief as the court thinks fit for restoring the position to what it otherwise would have been) where the creation of such security
interest or such guarantee constituted a preference.

It will only be a preference if at the time of the transaction or in consequence of the transaction the English company is unable
to pay its debts at the time of the transaction or becomes unable to pay its debts as a result (as defined in Section 123 of the
Insolvency Act). The transaction can be challenged if the English company enters into insolvency within a period of six months
(if the beneficiary is not a connected person) or two years (if the beneficiary is a connected person, except where such
beneficiary is a connected person by reason only of being the company’s employee) from the date the English company gives
the preference. A transaction may constitute a preference if it has the effect of putting a creditor of the English company (or a
surety or guarantor for any of the company’s debts or liabilities) in a better position (in the event of the company going into
insolvent liquidation) than such creditor, guarantor or surety would otherwise have been in had that transaction not been entered
into. However, for the court to determine a preference, it must be shown that the English company was influenced by a desire
to produce the preferential effect. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the English
company was unable to pay its debts at the relevant time and that there was such desire to prefer the relevant creditor, unless


-----

the beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person (except where such beneficiary is a connected person by reason only
of being the company’s employee), in which case it is presumed that the company intended to put that person in a better position
and the connected person must demonstrate that there was, in fact, no such influence.

If the court determines that the transaction was a preference, the court can make such order as it thinks fit to restore the company
to the position it would have been in had it not entered into the transaction, which may include reducing payments due under
or setting aside security interests or guarantees. An order by the court for a preference may affect the property of, or impose
any obligation on, any person whether or not he is the person to whom the preference was given, but such an order will not
prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the English company in good faith, for value
without notice of the relevant circumstances, or prejudice any interest deriving from such an interest, and will not require a
person who received a benefit from the preference in good faith, for value without notice of the relevant circumstances to pay
a sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company, except where the payment is to be in respect of a preference given to
that person at a time when he was a creditor of the English company.

_Transactions Defrauding Creditors_

Under section 423 of the Insolvency Act, where it can be shown that a transaction was at an undervalue, and the court is satisfied
it was made for the purpose of putting assets beyond the reach of a person who is making, or may make, a claim against a
company, or of otherwise prejudicing the interests of a person in relation to the claim which that person is making or may
make, the transaction may be set aside by the court as a transaction defrauding creditors. This provision may be used by any
person who claims to be a “victim” of the transaction (and is not therefore limited to liquidators or administrators) and, subject
to certain conditions, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, the UK Prudential Regulation Authority and the U.K. Pensions
Regulator (with the leave of the court if the company is in liquidation or administration). There is no statutory time limit under
English insolvency legislation within which the challenge must be made (subject to the normal statutory limitation periods)
and the relevant company does not need to be insolvent at the time of, or as a result of, the transaction.

If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, the court can make such orders as it thinks
fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into and to protect the interests of
the victims of the transaction, which may include reducing payments due under the Notes or setting aside security interests or
guarantees. The relevant court order may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person, whether or not he is
the person with whom the transaction was entered into. However, such an order will not prejudice any interest in property
which was acquired from a third party in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances, and will not
require a person who received a benefit from such transaction in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant
circumstances to pay any sum unless such person was a party to the transaction.

_Extortionate Credit Transactions_

An administrator or a liquidator can apply to court to set aside an extortionate credit transaction. A credit transaction is
“extortionate” if, having regard to the risk accepted by the person providing the credit, the terms of it are (or were) such as to
require grossly exorbitant payments to be made (whether unconditionally or in certain contingencies) in respect of the provision
of the credit or it otherwise grossly contravened ordinary principles of fair dealing. It is presumed, unless otherwise proved by
the person extending the credit, that a transaction with respect to which an administrator or liquidator makes an application to
set aside an extortionate credit transaction in extortionate. The court can review extortionate credit transactions up to three
years before the day on which the company entered into administration or went into liquidation. That order may set aside, either
in whole or in part, any obligation created by the transaction (which could include obligations of sureties). It may also vary the
terms of the transaction or the terms of any security for the purposes of the transaction, The court may require any party to the
transaction to repay to the liquidator or administrator sums already paid under the transaction and it may order the surrender of
any security held for the purpose of the transaction. It should be noted that there are no provisions for the protection of third
parties who acquire interests in the extortionate credit transaction (e.g. assignees of the benefit of the transaction from the
person who provided credit under it).

_Avoidance of Floating Charges_

Under section 245 of the Insolvency Act, floating charges created by an English company within a period of one year prior to
the onset of the English company’s insolvency (or two years in the case of a floating charge created in favor of a connected
person) at a time when the English company was unable to pay its debts or became unable to do so as a consequence of the
transaction, will be invalid, except to the extent of the value of: (a) the money paid to; (b) the goods or services supplied to; or
(c) any discharge or reduction of any debt of, the relevant English company at the same time as or after the creation of the
floating charge (plus certain interest) (the “Consideration”). The requirement for an English company to be unable to pay its


-----

debts at the time of granting the floating charge or becoming insolvent as a consequence of doing so does not apply where the
floating charge is granted to a connected person.

An administrator or liquidator (as applicable) does not need to apply to court for an order declaring that a floating charge is
invalid by operation of law. Any floating charge created during the relevant time period is automatically invalid, except to the
extent of the value of the Consideration, whether the relevant English company is solvent or insolvent at the time of grant.

An administrator or liquidator (as applicable) does not need to apply to court for an order declaring that a floating charge is
invalid by operation of law. Any floating charge created during the relevant time period is automatically invalid, except to the
extent of the value of the Consideration.

However, if the floating charge is created or otherwise arising under a “security financial collateral agreement” under the
Financial Collateral Regulations then the floating charge will not be subject to challenge as described in the “Administration”
paragraph above.

_Recharacterisation of fixed charges_

As referred to above (see “—Fixed versus floating charges” above), note the risk of a fixed charge being recharacterised as a
floating charge. If purported fixed security that is subsequently recharacterised has been granted within the suspect period
referred to above (see “—Avoidance of floating charges” above), this could render the charge invalid except to the value of the
Consideration.

_Disclaimer_

An English liquidator has the power to disclaim onerous property, which is any unprofitable contract or other property of the
company that cannot be sold, readily sold or may give rise to a liability to pay money or perform any other onerous act, by
serving the prescribed notice on the relevant party. A contract may be unprofitable if it gives rise to prospective liabilities and
imposes continuing financial obligations on a company that may be detrimental to creditors. A contract will not be unprofitable
merely because it is financially disadvantageous or because the company could have made, or could make, a better bargain.
However, this power to disclaim onerous property does not apply to an executed contract, nor can it, except so far as is necessary
for the purpose of releasing the company from any liability, disturb rights and liabilities of any other person. Any person
suffering loss or damage in consequence of the operation of the disclaimer is deemed to be a creditor of the company and may
prove for the loss or damage in the winding-up.

**_Limitation on Enforcement_**

_Constitutional documents, corporate benefit and financial assistance_

The grant of a Guarantee or Collateral by the English Guarantors in respect of the obligations of another group company must
satisfy certain legal requirements. More specifically, such a transaction must be allowed by the respective company’s
memorandum and articles of association. To the extent that these documents do not allow such an action, there is a risk that the
grant of the guarantee and the subsequent security can be found to be void and the respective creditor’s rights unenforceable.
Some comfort may be obtained for third parties if they are dealing with the English Guarantors in good faith; however, the
relevant legislation is not without difficulties in its interpretation.

Further, corporate benefit must be established for the English Guarantors by virtue of entering into the proposed transaction.
Section 172 of the Companies Act provides that a director must act in the way that he considers, in good faith, would be most
likely to promote the success of the English Guarantors for the benefit of its members as a whole. If the directors enter into a
transaction where there is no or insufficient commercial benefit, they may be found as abusing their powers as directors and
such a transaction may be vulnerable to being set aside by a court. Section 172(3) of the Companies Act additionally provides
that, in certain circumstances, the directors need to consider or act in the interests of the creditors of the company. While the
statutory provisions do not prescribe when this shift arises, the English courts have held that it takes place when the company
in question is either insolvent or is bordering on insolvency.

Guarantees and security granted by a company are also subject to limitations to the extent they would result in unlawful
financial assistance within the meaning of the Companies Act.


-----

_Security registration_

Under the Companies Act, subject to limited exceptions, any security document pursuant to which a charging company
incorporated in England and Wales grants security (including security not governed by English law) (together with prescribed
particulars of the security constituted thereby) must be received by the Registrar of Companies in England and Wales for
registration within 21 days after the date of creation of the security constituted by the applicable security document. While the
Companies Act does not impose an obligation as such on English companies to register security, such security, if not registered
within the 21-day period, will be deemed to be void against a liquidator, administrator or a creditor of the company. When
security becomes so void, the debt which was intended to be secured by such security is deemed to become immediately
payable.

In limited circumstances, it may be possible to apply to the English courts for an order allowing the charge to be registered
after the 21-day period has expired. An application for such an order can be made by the company or by any person interested
in the relevant security. The court will grant leave to register the security out of time if it considers it “just and expedient” to
do so, and will have particular regard to whether the failure to register was merely accidental and whether a late registration
will prejudice the position of creditors or shareholders. The court order will have to be enclosed with any delayed application
for registration of the security.

The Financial Collateral Regulations exempt certain charges over financial collateral from registration with the Registrar of
Companies. Security granted by non-English companies over assets in England and Wales does not need to be registered with
the Registrar of Companies at Companies House (although they may still need to be registered with the applicable asset
registry).

_Moratoriums_

As outlined above, certain of the insolvency processes available in England and Wales provide for the automatic or optional
moratorium imposing a period of time during which third parties including creditors are unable to institute or continue legal
action against the company, enforce certain rights and/or call upon security or guarantees. Besides the moratorium available to
companies undergoing administration (see “—Administration” above), moratoriums are also available to companies entering
liquidation (see “—Liquidation/winding-up” above).

Separately, Part A1 of the Insolvency Act provides for a standalone moratorium which is available independently of any other
insolvency process (the “Part A1 Moratorium”). As with a debtor-in-possession procedure, the directors remain in charge of
running the day-to-day business of the company during the Part A1 Moratorium, albeit under the supervision of a monitor,
being an insolvency practitioner reporting to the court.

A Part A1 Moratorium is generally available to any company incorporated in England, Wales or Scotland and certain overseas
companies, provided in case that (a) in the view of the directors, the company is, or is likely to become, unable to pay its debts,
and (b) in the view of the monitor, it is likely that the moratorium will result in the company being rescued as a going concern.
Certain companies are ineligible for the procedure, including those subject to a formal insolvency proceeding in the previous
12 months and companies which are party to “capital markets arrangements” where the debt incurred or expected to be incurred
is at least £10 million (at any time during the life of the capital market arrangement) and the arrangement involves the issue of
a capital market investment. This includes, amongst others, debt instruments which are either rated, listed or traded or designed
to be rated, listed or traded, and bonds and commercial paper issued to certain professional, high net worth or sophisticated
investors.

The Part A1 Moratorium is generally initiated by an out-of-court filing by the directors, and a court order is only necessary in
the case of overseas companies or where the company in question is subject to a winding-up petition. The Part A1 Moratorium
lasts for an initial period of 20 business days, subject to possible extensions. While subject to the Part A1 Moratorium, creditors
are prevented from placing the company into insolvency proceedings or taking other actions such as enforcing security,
crystallising floating charges or otherwise restricting the company’s ability to dispose of the assets subject to floating charges,
repossessing goods, forfeiting leases or commencing or continuing legal processes against the company, and the company
benefits from a payment holiday in respect of most (although not all) pre-moratorium debts, being debts incurred prior to the
commencement of the Part A1 Moratorium.

Moratorium debts (i.e. debts falling due pursuant to obligations incurred during the Part A1 Moratorium) and so-called priority
pre-moratorium debts, which include amounts due in respect of monitor remuneration and expenses, goods and services
supplied or rent falling due during the Part A1 Moratorium and, crucially, liabilities arising under instruments involving
financial services such as loans which remain unaccelerated, are not affected by the payment holiday. These debts also benefit
from ‘super priority’ vis-à-vis all other claims (other than those of fixed charge holders) if the company enters into


-----

administration or winding-up proceedings within 12 weeks of the end of a Part A1 Moratorium and cannot (without creditor
consent) be compromised in a company voluntary arrangement, scheme of arrangement or restructuring plan process proposed
within 12 weeks of the end of a Part A1 Moratorium.

_Restriction on the operation and exercise of ipso facto provisions_

Recent changes to the Insolvency Act introduced a restriction on the operation and exercise of ipso facto clauses in order to
preserve the continuity of the provision of goods and services to companies undergoing insolvency procedures. In general
terms, ipso facto clauses are provisions in supply of goods or services contracts which allow suppliers to terminate the contract
or supply or take any other action, or provide for the automatic termination of the contract or supply or the occurrence of any
other event, upon the counterparty entering an insolvency procedure. Under the new approach, to the extent that the trigger
event is the counterparty’s entry into a ‘relevant insolvency procedure’ (i.e. an administration, Part A1 Moratorium,
administrative receivership, company voluntary arrangement, liquidation and/or a restructuring plan), such clauses will be
deemed void and suppliers will be unable to terminate the relevant contracts unless the company or the relevant office-holder
consents to the termination or the court grants permission on the basis that it is satisfied that the continuation of the contract
would cause the supplier hardship.

The restrictions do not apply to a range of contracts involving financial services or entities involved in the provision of financial
services, including contracts for the provision of lending, financial leasing or guarantees, contracts for the purchase, sale or
loan of securities or commodities and agreements which are, or form part of, arrangements involving the issue of a capital
market investment (as defined in the Insolvency Act).

**_Security Over Shares_**

Security which does not involve transferring legal title over shares granted by the English Guarantors or over shares of the
English Guarantors are, under English law, equitable charges, not legal charges. An equitable charge arises where a chargor
creates an encumbrance over the property in favor of the chargee but the chargor retains legal title to the shares. Remedies in
relation to equitable charges may be subject to equitable considerations or are otherwise at the discretion of the court.

The validity of share security and the ability of secured parties to enforce security interests over shares may additionally be
affected if a restrictions notice is in place as a result of a failure of the charging company or related parties or (in certain
circumstances) the secured parties to comply within the relevant timeframes with the disclosure and notification obligations
under English company statutes in respect of persons with significant control and on the “relevant legal entities” (as defined
under Part 21A o the Companies Act).

**_Security Over Bank Accounts_**

With respect to any security over bank accounts (each an “Account Charge”) granted by the English Guarantors, the banks with
which some of those accounts are held (each an “Account Bank”) may hold a right at any time (at least prior to them being
notified of a crystallization event under the Account Charge) to exercise the rights of netting or set-off to which they are entitled
under their cash pooling or other arrangements with that guarantor.

As a result, and if the security granted over those accounts is merely a floating (rather than fixed) charge, the collateral
constituted by those bank accounts will be subject to the relevant Account Bank’s rights to exercise netting and set-off with
respect to the bank accounts charged under the relevant Account Charge. Once the floating charge has crystallized and
converted into a fixed charge (as it would on enforcement or the occurrence of certain insolvency events with respect to the
English Guarantors) and the Account Bank has been formally notified of that fact, the collateral will no longer be subject to
the relevant Account Bank’s netting and set-off rights, unless the Account Bank has expressly reserved set-off rights in such
circumstances.

**_Foreign Currency_**

Under English insolvency law, where creditors are asked to submit formal proofs of claim for their debts, the office-holder
must convert all foreign currency denominated proofs of debt into sterling at a single rate for each currency determined by the
office-holder by reference to the exchange rates prevailing at the date when the company went into liquidation or administration.
This provision overrides any agreement between the parties. If a creditor considers the rate to be unreasonable, they may apply
to the court.

Accordingly, in the event that an English Guarantor goes into liquidation or administration, holders of the Notes may be subject
to exchange rate risk between the date on which such English Guarantor goes into liquidation or administration and receipt of


-----

any amounts to which such holders of the Notes may become entitled. Any losses resulting from currency fluctuations are not
recoverable from the insolvent estate.

**_Company Voluntary Arrangements_**

English courts are empowered to oversee company voluntary arrangements in respect of companies within their general
jurisdiction (see “—Applicable legal framework and jurisdiction of the English courts” above) and companies incorporated in
England, Wales, Scotland or an EEA State or with their respective COMI in the UK or an EU member state (other than
Denmark).

Pursuant to Part I of the Insolvency Act, a company (by its directors or its administrator or liquidator as applicable) may propose
a company voluntary arrangement to the company’s shareholders and creditors which entails a compromise, or other
arrangement, between the company and its creditors, typically a rescheduling or reducing of the company’s debts. Provided
that the proposal is approved by the requisite majority of creditors by way of a decision procedure, it will bind all unsecured
creditors who were entitled to vote on the proposal. A company voluntary arrangement cannot affect the right of a secured
creditor to enforce its security, except with its consent.

In order for the company voluntary arrangement proposal to be passed, it must be approved by at least 75% (by value) of the
company’s creditors who respond in the decision procedure, and no more than 50% (by value) of unconnected creditors may
vote against it. A simple majority of the company’s members must also have voted on the proposal. However, if the company’s
creditors approve the proposal, the CVA will be implemented notwithstanding a vote against by the members. Secured debt
cannot be voted in a company voluntary arrangement. However, a secured creditor may vote to the extent that it is undersecured.
A secured creditor who proves in the company voluntary arrangement for the whole of its debt may be deemed to have given
up its security.

Unlike an administration proceeding, there is no automatic statutory moratorium that applies in respect of a company subject
to a company voluntary arrangement. A company may, however, enter into a Part A1 Moratorium (see “—Moratoriums” above)
prior to or while undergoing a company voluntary arrangement process which will terminate upon creditor approval of the
proposed arrangement.

**_Cross-border recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings_**

_General position_

The recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings in other jurisdictions is governed by applicable treaties in
respect of the mutual recognition (or otherwise) of courts’ jurisdiction, proceedings and judgments and general principles of
private international law such as comity and conflicts of laws rules applicable in the relevant jurisdictions.

One of the key insolvency-related treaties is the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency (the “Model Law”),
which has been adopted in a number of jurisdictions, including the United States and Great Britain, where it was implemented
by the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations. The Model Law provides for recognition of certain British insolvency proceedings
in other signatory states as either foreign main proceedings (if the COMI of the relevant debtor is determined to be in Great
Britain) or foreign non-main proceedings (if the COMI is determined to be in another jurisdiction but the debtor has an
establishment in Great Britain) upon application by the relevant insolvency officeholder. The nature and scope of the
recognition will depend on the way that the Model Law has been implemented into the domestic law of the jurisdiction in
question. Conversely, the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations provide for recognition in Great Britain of foreign insolvency
proceedings as either main proceedings (if the proceedings are taking place in the jurisdiction where the debtor has its COMI)
or non-main proceedings (if the proceedings are taking place in a jurisdiction in which the debtor has only an establishment).

The recognition of English courts’ jurisdiction and orders in respect of schemes of arrangement, which are restructuring rather
than insolvency proceedings, will be subject to treaties regarding matters relating to the jurisdiction of courts in civil
proceedings and the enforcement of civil judgments such as the Hague Convention and the Lugano Convention (subject to the
UK’s pending application to accede to the latter) where these apply. In addition, recognition may still be available under
principles of private international law and Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17
June 2008 on the law applicable to contractual obligations (“Rome I”).

The recognition of English courts’ jurisdiction and orders in respect of restructuring plans is a developing area of law. It remains
to be seen whether restructuring plans will fall within the scope of treaties regarding matters relating to the jurisdiction of courts
in civil proceedings and the enforcement of civil judgments such as the Hague Convention and the Lugano Convention, or


-----

whether they will be treated more akin to insolvency and restructuring proceedings and fall within related exceptions to such
treaties.

_Recognition in the EU_

Following the UK’s departure from the EU and the expiry of the Transition Period, UK proceedings no longer benefit from
automatic and guaranteed recognition in EU member states. As the trade and cooperation terms agreed between the EU and the
UK do not include a replacement regime for the current automatic recognition of UK insolvency procedures across the EU (and
vice versa) or otherwise address insolvency matters, cross-border insolvencies involving the UK and one or more EU member
states will be subject to a degree of uncertainty and increased complexity.

Unless or until a mutual recognition agreement is reached in the future, it is likely to be more problematic for UK restructuring
and insolvency proceedings to be recognised in EU member states and for UK office holders to effectively deal with assets
located in EU member states. The general position outlined above will apply and recognition will depend on the private
international law rules adopted in the relevant EU member state and the need may well arise to open parallel proceedings,
increasing the element of risk as well as costs. In particular in cases where the appointment of a UK office holder is made in
reliance on a UK domestic approach rather than COMI rules, it is much less certain that such appointment will be recognised
in other EU member states. To the extent relevant proceedings are deemed to fall within the remit of contract law, Rome I may
offer an alternative basis for recognition in EU member states.

As a consequence, the recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings across the EU member states may be
different from what investors may have experienced in the past when the UK was a member state of the EU. It is not possible
to predict with certainty if and to what extent proceedings will be recognised and whether investors may be adversely affected
as a result.

**European Union**

On June 5, 2015, Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015 on insolvency
proceedings (as last amended by Regulation (EU) 2021/2260 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 December
2021, the “Recast Insolvency Regulation”) was published in the Official Gazette of the European Union. The Recast Insolvency
Regulation applies to insolvency proceedings that are collective insolvency proceedings of the types referred to in Annex A to
the Recast Insolvency Regulation.

**_Main Insolvency Proceedings_**

Pursuant to Article 3(1) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, the court which shall have jurisdiction to open insolvency
proceedings in relation to a company is the court of the member state of the European Union (the “Member State”) (other than
Denmark) within which the center of a debtor’s main interests is situated. The “center of main interests” is defined as “the place
where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties”.
Pursuant to Article 3(1) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, the center of main interests of a company or legal person is
presumed to be located in the Member State of the registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary. That presumption
shall only apply if the registered office has not been moved to another Member State within a three-month period prior to the
request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Specifically, it should be possible to rebut this presumption where the
company’s central administration is located in a Member State other than that of its registered office, and where a
comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the
company’s actual center of management and supervision and of the management of its interests is located in that other Member
State. In this regard, special consideration should be given to creditors and their perception as to where a debtor conducts the
administration of its interests. In the event of a shift in the center of main interests, this may require informing the creditors of
the new location from which the debtor is carrying out its activities in due course (e.g., by drawing attention to the change of
address in commercial correspondence or otherwise making the new location public through other appropriate means).

If the “center of main interests” of a company at the time an insolvency application is made, is located in a Member State (other
than Denmark), the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the company under the Recast Insolvency Regulation would be
commenced in such jurisdiction and, accordingly, a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of
insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the Recast Insolvency Regulation.

Furthermore, pursuant to Article 6 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, the courts of the Member State within the territory of
which insolvency proceedings have been opened in accordance with Article 3 shall have jurisdiction for any action that derives
directly from the insolvency proceedings and is closely linked with them, such as avoidance actions.


-----

**_Secondary Insolvency Proceedings_**

Insolvency proceedings opened in one Member State under the Recast Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in the other
Member States (other than Denmark), although secondary proceedings may be opened in other Member States. If the “center
of main interests” of a debtor is in one Member State (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the Recast Insolvency
Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to open “secondary” or “territorial”
insolvency proceedings only in the event that such debtor has an “establishment” in the territory of such other Member State.
Secondary proceedings may be any insolvency proceeding listed in Annex A of the Recast Insolvency Regulation and for the
avoidance of doubt, are not limited to winding up proceedings. Territorial proceedings are, in effect, secondary proceedings
which are commenced prior to the opening of main insolvency proceedings and which will usually convert to secondary
proceedings on the opening of the main proceedings. “Establishment” is defined as any place of operations where a debtor
carries out or has carried out in the three-month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory
economic activity with human means and assets. The effects of those territorial proceedings are restricted to the assets of the
debtor situated in the territory of such other Member State.

Pursuant to Article 3(4) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, where main proceedings in the Member State in which the
company has its center of main interests have not yet been opened, territorial insolvency proceedings can only be opened in
another Member State where the company has an establishment and either: (a) insolvency proceedings cannot be opened in the
Member State in which the company’s center of main interests is situated under that Member State’s law; or (b) the territorial
insolvency proceedings are opened at the request of a creditor whose claim arises from or in connection with the operation of
such establishment or a public authority, which has the right to request such opening under the respective Member State’s law,
requests the opening of such proceedings. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary insolvency
proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain exemptions, be governed by the lex fori concursus; that is, the local
insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction for the respective main, territorial or secondary insolvency
proceedings, as the case may be, of the company.

Pursuant to Article 21 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency officeholder appointed by the court of the main
proceedings may exercise the powers conferred on him by the law of that Member State in another Member State (such as to
remove assets of the company from that other Member State), subject to certain limitations, so long as no insolvency
proceedings have been opened in that other Member State or any preservation measure has been taken to the contrary further
to a request to open insolvency proceedings in that other Member State where the company has assets.

However, under Article 36 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings
may prevent the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings in another Member State by giving a unilateral undertaking in
respect of the assets located in the Member State in which secondary insolvency proceedings could be opened. For this purpose,
the insolvency practitioner must undertake to comply with the distribution and priority rights under the relevant national law
from which the local creditors would benefit if the insolvency proceedings were opened in the Member State where the assets
are located. Such undertaking must be made in writing and is subject to approval by a qualified majority of known local
creditors, determined in accordance with applicable local laws. If approved, the undertaking is binding on the insolvency estate
and if a court is requested to open secondary insolvency proceedings, it should, at the request of the insolvency practitioner in
the main insolvency proceedings, refuse to open such proceeding if it is satisfied that the undertaking adequately protects the
general interests of local creditors.

Additionally, under Article 38 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, where a temporary stay of individual enforcement
proceedings has been granted in order to allow for negotiations between a company and its creditors, the court, at the request
of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, may stay the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings
for a period not exceeding three months, provided that suitable measures are in place to protect the interests of local creditors.

Under Article 46 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, the court which opened the secondary insolvency proceedings will also
stay the process of realization of assets in whole or in part on receipt of a request from the insolvency practitioner in the main
insolvency proceedings, for a renewable period of up to three months, unless such a request is manifestly of no interest to the
creditors in the main insolvency proceedings. Such stay may be continued or renewed for similar periods. Where the court
stays the process of realization of the assets, the court may require the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency
proceedings to take any suitable measure to guarantee the interests of the creditors in the secondary insolvency proceedings
and of individual classes of creditors.

Pursuant to Article 4 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, a court requested to open insolvency proceedings will be required
to examine whether it has jurisdiction pursuant to Article 3; such decision may be challenged by the debtor or any creditor on
grounds of international jurisdiction.


-----

In the event that the Issuer, the Guarantors or any provider of collateral experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to
predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings will be commenced, or the
outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations of the Issuer, the
Guarantors and the collateral provided by any other company. The insolvency, administration and other laws of the jurisdictions
in which the respective companies are organized or operate may be materially different from, or conflict with, each other and
there is no assurance as to how the insolvency laws of the potentially involved jurisdictions will be applied in relation to one
another.

**_Insolvency Proceedings Involving Members of a Group of Companies_**

The Recast Insolvency Regulation provides for a cooperation and communication mechanism in the event that insolvency
proceedings concerning two or more members of a group of companies are opened. Insolvency practitioners appointed in
proceedings concerning a member of the group shall cooperate with any insolvency practitioner appointed in proceedings
concerning another member of the group to the extent that such cooperation is appropriate. Similarly, the court which has
opened proceedings shall also cooperate with any other court before which a request is made to open proceedings concerning
another member of the group to the extent that cooperation is appropriate to facilitate the effective administration of the
proceedings, is not incompatible with the rules applicable to them and does not entail any conflict of interest. In this respect,
the courts may, where appropriate, appoint a third party, provided that this is not incompatible with the rules applicable to
them.

**Germany**

**_Insolvency_**

One or more of the Guarantors are organized under the laws of Germany, have their registered offices in Germany and
substantially all of their assets are located in Germany (the “German Guarantors”). Consequently, any insolvency proceedings
with regard to a German Guarantor is likely to be initiated in Germany and, if the relevant German Guarantor were held to have
its center of main interests within the territory of Germany at the time the application for the opening of insolvency proceedings
(Insolvenzeröffnungsantrag) is filed, German insolvency law would most likely govern such proceedings. The insolvency laws
of Germany and, in particular, the provisions of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) may not be as favorable to
your interests as creditors as the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions, including, inter alia, in respect of priority of creditors’
claims, the ability to obtain post-petition interest as well as security interests and the duration of the insolvency proceedings,
and therefore may limit your ability to recover payments due on the Notes to an extent exceeding the limitations arising under
other insolvency laws.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Germany.

Under German insolvency law, there is no group insolvency concept, which generally means that, despite the economic ties
between various entities within one group of companies, there will be one separate insolvency proceeding for each of the
entities if and to the extent there exists a reason for the insolvency on the part of the relevant entity. Each of these insolvency
proceedings will be legally independent from all other insolvency proceedings (if any) within the group. In particular, there is
no consolidation of assets and liabilities of a group of companies in the event of insolvency and no pooling of claims among
the respective entities of a group. In March 2017, the German parliament passed an act to facilitate the mastering of group
insolvencies (Gesetz zur Erleichterung der Bewältigung von Konzerninsolvenzen), which came into force on April 21, 2018.
The aim of the act is to facilitate the coordination of and cooperation between insolvency proceedings of group companies. The
act introduced (i) the ability for one court to assume jurisdiction for other group company insolvency proceedings at the request
of a group company (Gruppen-Gerichtsstand), (ii) thereby facilitating the appointment of the same person as insolvency
administrator for all relevant German group companies (without any obligation of the court to do so), (iii) a coordination
obligation between the insolvency administrators, insolvency court(s) and creditor committees, and (iv) upon a respective
filing, a coordination proceeding (Koordinationsverfahren) and the appointment of a coordinator (Verfahrenskoordinator) who
may submit a coordination plan (Koordinationsplan) for approval by the coordination court (Koordinationsgericht). The act
does not provide for a consolidation of the insolvency proceedings of the insolvent group companies, or a consolidation of the
assets and liabilities of a group of companies or pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group.

Since June 26, 2017, in the case of European Union cross-border group insolvencies Articles 56 et seq. Recast Insolvency
Regulation, introduced obligations for communication and cooperation between the administrators and courts involved. In
addition, a coordination procedure can be initiated which enables the appointment of a coordinator and the elaboration of a
cross-border coordination plan.


-----

Under German insolvency law, insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent insolvency court ex officio, but
require that the debtor or a creditor files a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Insolvency proceedings can be
initiated in the event of the over-indebtedness (Überschuldung) of the debtor or in the event that the debtor is illiquid, i.e.
unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due (Zahlungsunfähigkeit). According to the relevant provision of the German
Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), a debtor is over-indebted when its liabilities exceed the value of its assets (based on their
liquidation values), unless a continuation of the debtor’s business is predominantly likely for a prognosis period covering the
next twelve months (positive Fortbestehensprognose). Under the Act on the Temporary Adjustment of Restructuring and
Insolvency Law Provisions to Mitigate Crisis Effects (Gesetz zur vorübergehenden Anpassung sanierungs- und
_insolvenzrechtlicher Vorschriften zur Abmilderung von Krisenfolgen) (the “SanInsKG”), the forecast period relevant for the_
over-indebtedness test was reduced to four months until December 31, 2023. However, from September 1, 2023 onwards,
management may need to take into account that the reduction ceases to apply within the four-month period. As a guideline, the
debtor is deemed illiquid if it is unable to pay 10% or more of its due and payable liabilities during the subsequent three weeks,
unless it is virtually certain that the company can close the liquidity gap shortly thereafter (demnächst) and it can be deemed
acceptable to the creditor to continue to wait for the payments owed by such debtor. If a stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft—
_AG), a European law stock corporation based in Germany (Societas Europaea—SE), a limited liability company (Gesellschaft_
_mit beschränkter Haftung—GmbH) or any company not having an individual as its personally liable shareholder is in a situation_
of illiquidity and/or over-indebtedness, the management of such company and, under certain circumstances, its shareholders
are obligated to file for the opening of insolvency proceedings without undue delay, however, in the case of illiquidity at the
latest within three weeks after illiquidity occurred and in case of over-indebtedness at the latest six weeks after-overindebtedness occurred. Under the SanInsKG, the six-week period following the occurrence of over-indebtedness was extended
to a period of eight weeks until December 31, 2023. Noncompliance with these obligations exposes management to both severe
damage claims as well as sanctions under criminal law. Once illiquidity or over-indebtedness occurred, any payments, including
any payments under the Guarantees by the German Guarantors, may be voidable. In addition, imminent illiquidity (drohende
_Zahlungsunfähigkeit) is a valid insolvency reason under German law which exists if the company currently is able to service_
its payment obligations, but will presumably not be able to continue to do so at some point in time within a certain prognosis
period (such period generally being 24 months). However, only the management of the debtor, but not the creditors, are entitled
(but not obliged) to file for the opening of insolvency proceedings in case of imminent illiquidity.

The insolvency proceedings are administered by the competent insolvency court which monitors the due performance of the
proceedings. Upon receipt of the insolvency petition, the insolvency court may take preliminary measures to secure the property
of the debtor during the preliminary proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsverfahren). The insolvency court may prohibit or suspend
any measures taken to enforce individual claims against the debtor’s assets during these preliminary proceedings. In addition,
the court will also appoint a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter), unless the debtor has
petitioned for the appointment of a preliminary custodian (vorläufiger Sachwalter) in preparation of a debtor-in-possession
proceeding (Eigenverwaltung)—an insolvency process in which the debtor’s management generally remains in charge of
administering the debtor’s business affairs under the supervision of a preliminary custodian—with this petition not being
obviously futile. Depending on the size of the debtor’s business operations, the insolvency court must or may appoint a
preliminary creditors’ committee (vorläufiger Gläubigerausschuss) to form a view on the profile of the preliminary insolvency
administrator to be appointed or even to make a suggestion for a particular individual to be appointed by the court. In case the
members of the preliminary creditors’ committee unanimously agree on an individual, such suggestion is binding on the court
(unless the suggested individual is not eligible; i.e., incompetent and/or not disinterested). To ensure that the preliminary
creditors’ committee reflects the interests of all creditor constituencies, it shall comprise a representative of the secured
creditors, one for the large and one for the small creditors as well as one for the employees. The duty of the preliminary
insolvency administrator is, in particular, to safeguard and to preserve the debtor’s assets (which includes the continuation of
the business carried out by the debtor) and to assess whether the debtor’s net assets will be sufficient to cover the costs of the
insolvency proceedings. Additionally, the preliminary insolvency administrator is normally obligated to verify the existence of
reason for insolvency. The court orders the opening (Eröffnungsbeschluss) of formal insolvency proceedings (eröffnetes
_Insolvenzverfahren) if certain requirements are met, particularly if (i) the debtor is in a situation of imminent illiquidity (if the_
petition has been filed by the debtor), over-indebtedness or illiquidity and (ii) there are sufficient assets to cover at least the
cost of the insolvency proceedings. If the assets of the debtor are not expected to be sufficient, the insolvency court will only
open formal insolvency proceedings if third parties, such as creditors, advance the costs themselves. A debtor or its
representative who were obliged but did not file for bankruptcy must pay such costs to enable an opening order. In the absence
of such advancement, the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings will be dismissed for insufficiency of assets
(Abweisung mangels Masse).

Upon the opening of formal insolvency proceedings, an insolvency administrator (usually the same person who acted as
preliminary insolvency administrator) is appointed by the insolvency court unless a debtor-in-possession proceeding
(Eigenverwaltung) is ordered. In the absence of a debtor-in-possession proceeding, the right to administer the debtor’s business
affairs and to dispose of the assets of the debtor passes to the insolvency administrator with the insolvency creditors


-----

(Insolvenzgläubiger) only being entitled to change the individual appointed as insolvency administrator upon the occasion of
the first creditors’ assembly (erste Gläubigerversammlung) with such change requiring that (i) a simple majority of votes cast
(by heads and amount of insolvency claims) has voted in favor of the proposed individual to become insolvency administrator
and (ii) the proposed individual being eligible as officeholder (i.e., he or she is sufficiently qualified, business-experienced and
impartial). The insolvency administrator may raise new financial indebtedness and incur other liabilities to continue the debtor’s
business. These new liabilities incurred by the insolvency administrator qualify as preferential claims against the estate
(Masseforderung) which are preferred to any insolvency claim of an unsecured creditor (with the residual claim of a secured
insolvency creditor remaining after realization of the available collateral (if any) also qualifying as unsecured insolvency claim).

From the perspective of the holders of the Notes, among others, some important consequences of such opening of formal
insolvency proceedings that are subject to the German insolvency regime would be the following:

  - if the court does not order debtor-in-possession proceeding, the right to administer and dispose of the assets of the
relevant German Guarantor and any of its subsidiaries would generally pass to the insolvency administrator
(Insolvenzverwalter) as sole representative of the insolvency estate;

  - if the court does not order debtor-in-possession proceeding with respect to the relevant German Guarantor and any of
its subsidiaries, disposals effected by the management of such German Guarantor and any of its subsidiaries, after the
opening of formal insolvency proceedings, are null and void by operation of law;

  - if, during the final month preceding the date of filing for insolvency proceedings or thereafter, a creditor in the
insolvency proceedings has acquired through execution (e.g., attachment) a security interest in part of the relevant
German Guarantor’s or any of its subsidiaries’ property that would normally form part of the insolvency estate, such
security becomes null and void by operation of law upon the opening of formal insolvency proceedings; and

  - claims against the relevant German Guarantor and any of its subsidiaries may only be pursued in accordance with the
rules set forth in the German Insolvency Code.

Any person that has a right for separation (Aussonderung) (i.e., the relevant asset of this person does not constitute part of the
insolvency estate) does not participate in the insolvency proceedings; the claim for separation must be enforced in the course
of ordinary court proceedings against the insolvency administrator.

All creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a right to separate an asset from the insolvency estate
(Aussonderungsrecht) or are preferred creditors (Massegläubiger)), wishing to assert claims against the insolvent debtor need
to participate in the insolvency proceedings by filing their claims with the insolvency administrator. German insolvency
proceedings are collective proceedings and creditors may generally no longer pursue their individual claims in the insolvency
proceedings separately, but can instead only enforce them in compliance with the restrictions of the German Insolvency Code.
Any judicial enforcement action (Zwangsvollstreckung) brought against the debtor by any of its creditors is subject to an
automatic stay once insolvency proceedings have been opened. Therefore, secured creditors are generally not entitled to enforce
any security interest outside the insolvency proceedings. In the insolvency proceedings, however, secured creditors have certain
preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte). Depending on the legal nature of the security interest, entitlement to enforce such
security is either vested with the secured creditor or the insolvency administrator. In this context, it should be noted that the
insolvency administrator generally has the sole right to realize any movable assets in his, her or the debtor’s possession that are
subject to preferential rights (e.g., liens over movable assets (Mobiliarsicherungsrechte), or security transfer of title
(Sicherungsübereignung)) as well as to collect any claims that are subject to security assignment agreements
(Sicherungsabtretungen). If the enforcement right is vested with the insolvency administrator, the enforcement proceeds, less
certain contributory charges for (i) assessing the value of the secured assets (Feststellungskosten) and (ii) realizing the secured
assets (Verwertungskosten) which, in the aggregate, usually add up to 9% of the gross enforcement proceeds plus VAT (if any),
are disbursed to the creditor holding a security interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount equal to its secured claims.
With the remaining unencumbered assets of the debtor the insolvency administrator has first to satisfy the preferential creditors
of the insolvency estate (Massegläubiger) (including the costs of the insolvency proceedings as well as any preferred liabilities
incurred by the insolvency estate after, or with permission of the insolvency court prior to, the opening of formal insolvency
proceedings). Thereafter, all other unsubordinated claims (insolvency claims) (Insolvenzforderungen), will be satisfied on a
_pro rata basis if and to the extent there is cash remaining in the insolvent estate (Insolvenzmasse) after the security interest and_
the preferential claims against the estate have been settled and paid in full. Therefore, the proceeds resulting from the realization
of the insolvency estate of the debtor may not be sufficient to satisfy unsecured creditors of the relevant German Guarantor or
under a guarantee granted by such German Guarantor in full after the preferred and secured creditors have been satisfied.
Claims of subordinated creditors in the insolvency proceedings (nachrangige Insolvenzgläubiger) are satisfied only after the
claims of other non-subordinated creditors (including the unsecured insolvency claims) have been fully satisfied.


-----

While in ordinary insolvency proceedings the value of the debtor’s assets is realized by a piecemeal sale or, as the case may
be, by a bulk sale of the debtor’s business as a going concern, a different approach aimed at the rehabilitation of the debtor can
be taken based on an insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan). Such plan can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency administrator
and requires, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, the consent of the debtor and the consent of each class of
creditors in accordance with specific majority rules and the approval of the insolvency court. The insolvency court may order
the deemed approval of one or more opposing creditor groups under certain conditions (cram down). The insolvency plan may
derogate from the provisions of the Insolvency Code. In particular, it may contain provision regarding the discharge of secured
and unsecured creditors, the disposal of the insolvency estate as well as procedure. It may also create, modify, transfer or
terminate rights in rem such as property rights or security interests. If the debtor is a corporate entity, the shares or, as the case
may be, the membership rights in the debtor can also be included in the insolvency plan, e.g., these can be transferred to third
parties, including a transfer to creditors based on a debt-to-equity swap. Thus, an insolvency plan could under certain
circumstances provide for provisions regarding the Guarantees or the Collateral which are less favorable to the Noteholders
than the provisions of the German Insolvency Code, such as the release of the Collateral, the release of obligations under the
Guarantees of the German Guarantors or the contribution of the Guarantees of the German Guarantors in exchange for equity.
Under certain conditions, such provisions could be adopted against the votes of the affected Noteholders. Moreover, if the
debtor has filed a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings based on a reason for the insolvency other than illiquidity
(i.e., imminent illiquidity or over-indebtedness), combined with a petition to initiate such process based on a debtor-in
possession proceeding and can demonstrate that a restructuring of its business is not obviously futile, the court may grant a
period of up to three months to draw up an insolvency plan for the debtor business (Schutzschirmverfahren). During this period,
the creditors’ rights to enforce security may—upon application of the filing debtor—be suspended. Under these circumstances,
the insolvency court must appoint a preliminary custodian to supervise the process. The debtor is entitled to suggest an
individual to be appointed as custodian with such suggestion being binding on the insolvency court unless the suggested person
is obviously not eligible to become a custodian (i.e., he or she is obviously not competent or impartial).

Under the German Insolvency Code, the insolvency administrator or custodian may void (anfechten) transactions, performances
or other acts that are deemed detrimental to insolvency creditors and which were effected prior to the commencement of formal
insolvency proceedings during applicable voidance periods. Generally, if transactions, performances or other acts are
successfully voided by the insolvency administrator or custodian, any amounts or other benefits derived from such challenged
transaction, performance or act must be returned to the insolvency estate. The administrator’s or custodian’s right to void
transactions can, depending on the circumstances, extend to transactions having occurred up to ten years prior to the filing for
the commencement of insolvency proceedings.

In the event of insolvency proceedings with respect to the Issuer or any Guarantor based on and governed by the insolvency
laws of Germany, the payment of any amounts to the noteholders as well as the granting of collateral for or providing credit
support for the benefit of the Notes could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator or custodian under
the rules of voidness as set forth in the German Insolvency Code. In case the validity or enforceability of the Notes or any
collateral in favor of the Notes is voided successfully, you may not be able to recover any amounts under the Guarantees or the
collateral. If payments have already been made under the Guarantees or collateral, the insolvency administrator or custodian
may require that the recipients return the payment to the insolvency estate and you would instead then only have a general
unsecured claim under the Guarantees without preference in insolvency proceedings (unless and to the extent the collateral
would not be subject to voidness in which case such claim would be secured to that extent).

In particular, an act (Rechtshandlung) or a legal transaction (Rechtsgeschäft) (which term includes the granting of a guarantee,
the provision of security and the payment of debt) detrimental to the creditors of the debtor may be voided according to the
German Insolvency Code in the following cases:

  - any act granting a creditor security or satisfaction for a debt (Befriedigung) can be voided if the transaction was
effected (i) in the last three months prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, if at the
time of the transaction the debtor was illiquid (zahlungsunfähig), which means such debtor was unable to pay its debt
when due and the creditor had knowledge thereof, or (ii) after a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings
has been filed and the creditor had knowledge thereof or of the debtor being illiquid, whereby in each case an affiliated
party as defined below shall be presumed to have been aware of the debtor’s insolvency or of the filing to open
insolvency proceedings;

  - any act granting a creditor security or satisfaction for a debt to which such creditor had no right, no right at the
respective time or no right as to the respective manner, can be voided if the transaction was effected in the month prior
to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings; if the transaction was effected in the second and
third month prior to the filing, it can be voided if at the time of the transaction (i) the debtor was illiquid, or (ii) the
creditor knew that the transaction would be detrimental to the creditors of the debtor whereby in each case an affiliated


-----

party as defined below shall be presumed to have been aware of the debtor’s insolvency or of the filing to open
insolvency proceedings;

  - any legal transaction effected by the debtor which is directly detrimental to the creditors of the debtor can be voided
if the transaction was effected (i) in the last three months prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency
proceedings against the debtor, if at the time of the legal transaction the debtor was illiquid and the other party to the
legal transaction had knowledge thereof or (ii) after a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings has been
filed against the debtor and the other party to the legal transaction had knowledge thereof or of the debtor being
illiquid, whereby in each case an affiliated party as defined below shall be presumed to have been aware of the debtor’s
insolvency or of the filing to open insolvency proceedings;

  - if an act whereby a debtor grants security for a third-party debts is regarded as having been granted gratuitously
(unentgeltlich); such gratuitous transaction can be voided unless it was effected earlier than four years prior to the
filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings against the debtor;

  - any act performed by the debtor during a period of ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of
insolvency proceedings or at any time after such filing can be voided if the debtor acted with the intent to disadvantage
its creditors and the beneficiary of the transaction had knowledge of such intent at the time of the transaction, with
such knowledge being presumed if the beneficiary knew that the debtor was at least imminently illiquid and that the
transaction disadvantaged the other creditors. The period referred to above is reduced from ten to four years in the
event the transaction results in, or puts the other party in a position to obtain or seek, credit support or satisfaction. In
the event that the transaction results in, or puts the other party in a position to obtain or seek, credit support or
satisfaction which the other party is not entitled to in such way or at such time or at all, then knowledge is not already
presumed to exist in case that the other party has knowledge of the imminent illiquidity of the debtor but will only be
deemed in the case the other party has knowledge of the actual illiquidity. If the other party reached a payment
agreement (Zahlungsvereinbarung) with the creditor or granted any other form of payment facility
(Zahlungserleichterungen) to the creditor, there is a presumption that he had no knowledge of imminent insolvency
at the time of the transaction;

  - any non-gratuitous contract concluded between the debtor and an affiliated party which directly operates to the
detriment of the creditors can be voided unless such contract was concluded earlier than two years prior to the filing
of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or the other party had no knowledge of the debtor’s intention
to disadvantage its creditors as of the time the contract was concluded; in relation to corporate entities, the term;

  - “affiliated party” includes, subject to certain limitations, members of management or the supervisory board, general
partners and shareholders owning more than 25% of the debtor’s share capital, persons or companies holding
comparable positions that give them access to information about the economic situation of the debtor, and other
persons who are spouses, relatives or members of the household of any of the foregoing persons;

  - any act that provides security or satisfaction for a claim of a shareholder for the repayment of a shareholder loan
(Gesellschafterdarlehen) or an economically equivalent claim can be voided

(a) in the event it provided security, if the transaction was effected within the last ten years prior to the filing of
a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or thereafter, or

(b) in the event it provided satisfaction, if the transaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a
petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or thereafter; or

  - any act whereby the debtor grants satisfaction for a loan claim or an economically equivalent claim to a third party
can be voided if the transaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency
proceedings or thereafter and if a shareholder of the debtor had granted security or was liable as a guarantor (Bürge)
(in which case the shareholder must compensate the debtor for the amounts paid (subject to further conditions)).

For purposes of the above, the knowledge of circumstances from which a compelling conclusion regarding the debtor’s
illiquidity or regarding the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings can be drawn, will be considered
tantamount to the actual knowledge of the debtor’s illiquidity or of the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency
proceedings.


-----

The granting of security concurrently with the incurrence of debt may be qualified as a “cash transaction” and may as such be
privileged, i.e., under certain circumstances, not being subject to voidness rights under the German Insolvency Code
(Bargeschäftsprivileg).

Apart from the examples of an insolvency administrator or custodian voiding transactions according to the German Insolvency
Code described above, a creditor who has obtained an enforcement order (Vollstreckungstitel) could possibly also void any
security right or payment performed under the relevant security right in accordance with the German Law of Voidness
(Anfechtungsgesetz) outside formal insolvency proceedings. The prerequisites vary to a certain extent from the rules described
above and the voidance periods are calculated from the date when a creditor exercises its rights of voidance in the courts.

Under German insolvency law, termination rights, automatic termination events or “escape clauses” entitling one party to
terminate an agreement, or resulting in an automatic termination of an agreement, upon the opening of insolvency proceedings
in respect of the other party, the filing for insolvency or the occurrence of reasons justifying the opening of insolvency
proceedings (insolvenzbezogene Kündigungsrechte oder Lösungsklauseln) may be ruled invalid by a German Court if they
frustrate the election right of the insolvency administrator whether or not to perform the contract. This may also relate to
agreements that are not governed by German law.

In addition, powers of attorney granted by the relevant debtor and certain other legal relationships cease to be effective upon
the opening of insolvency proceedings. Certain executory contracts become unenforceable at such time unless and until the
insolvency administrator opts for performance.

Finally, the insolvency estate shall serve to satisfy the liquidated claims held by the personal creditors against the debtor on the
date when the insolvency proceedings were opened. The following claims shall be satisfied ranking below the other claims of
insolvency creditors in the order given below, and according to the proportion of their amounts if ranked with equal status:
(i) interest and penalty payments accrued on the claims of the insolvency creditors from the opening of the insolvency
proceedings; (ii) costs incurred by individual insolvency creditors due to their participation in the insolvency proceedings;
(iii) fines, regulatory fines, coercive fines and administrative fines, as well as such incidental legal consequences of a criminal
or administrative offense binding the debtor to pay money; (iv) claims to the debtor’s gratuitous performance of a consideration;
and (v) claims for restitution of a shareholder loan or claims resulting from legal transactions corresponding in economic terms
to such a loan, unless a state aid bank or any of its subsidiaries which is a shareholder of the relevant company have granted
the respective loan or legal transaction corresponding in economic terms to such a loan.

**_Preventive Restructuring Framework_**

On June 20, 2019, the European Parliament and the Council have adopted a new directive, which aims to ensure that minimum
restructuring measures are available in the EU member states to enable debtors in financial distress to solve their problems at
an early stage and to avoid formal insolvency proceedings (Directive of the European Parliament and the Council EU 2019/1023
on preventive restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on measures to increase the efficiency
of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt, and amending Directive (EU) 2017/1132 (the
“Preventive Restructuring Directive”)).

In Germany, the Preventive Restructuring Directive was implemented by the law on the Further Development of the German
Restructuring and Insolvency Laws, which became effective on January 1, 2021. An essential part of the law is the introduction
of a new Act on a Stabilization and Restructuring Framework for Enterprises (Gesetz über den Stabilisierungs- und
_Restrukturierungsrahmen) (“Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act”), which establishes a comprehensive legal_
framework for out-of-court restructurings in Germany. Proceedings under the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act
(“Restructuring Proceedings”) are initiated through a notification by the respective debtor to affected creditors and/or the
competent restructuring court (Anzeige des Restrukturierungsvorhabens). Restructuring Proceedings are applicable in cases in
which a debtor faces imminent illiquidity, i.e., that there is the imminent risk for the debtor of being unable to pay any of its
debt as and when it falls due during the course of (regularly) the next 24 months.

A debtor can access the new restructuring tools of the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act upon the occurrence of
imminent illiquidity which is triggered when it is likely that the debtor will not be able to meet its future payment obligations
that fall due over the next 24 months. The debtor’s management is not obliged to make use of the tools of the Company
Stabilization and Restructuring Act. Therefore, the debtor may alternatively file for regular insolvency proceedings if the
respective requirements are met (see above under “—Insolvency.”).

Unlike insolvency proceedings, the tools under the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act do not necessarily cover all
of a debtor’s liabilities, as the debtor has a certain amount of flexibility under the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act
to adapt the scope of the available tools to cover either all of the debtor’s liabilities, only certain types (e.g., financial liabilities,


-----

including under the Notes), or only selected liabilities. In addition and depending on the extent to which a debtor requires to
make use of certain legal tools available under the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act, the involvement of the
competent restructuring court can be kept to a minimum and the tools can—under certain circumstances—even be used without
the need for any public notices despite being binding on affected creditors. The tools available under the Company Stabilization
and Restructuring Act may in the case of a group of companies only be used for each entity separately (an important exception
is the ability to extend the effect of certain tools to cover security granted by entities that are connected entities (verbundene
_Unternehmen) of the debtor). However, the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act provides for a respective application_
of the provisions of the German Insolvency Code which implemented the law to facilitate the mastering of group insolvencies
(see above under “—Insolvency.”).

The core component of the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act is an out-of-court restructuring of a debtor’s liabilities
via a restructuring plan, including, e.g., by way of changes to the principal amounts, interest rates and/or maturities of liabilities.
Such restructuring plan may also negatively impact (including, e.g., a release of) collateral granted for the benefit of the Notes
by the debtor as well as its subsidiaries, parent and sister companies. A restructuring plan, which can be submitted solely by
the debtor, can generally be adopted and become binding for creditors upon being approved by the required majority or
majorities of a debtors’ creditors. The restructuring plan will be voted on in classes. The adoption of the restructuring plan
requires, in principle, that in each class a majority of three-quarters of the voting rights approve the plan (whereas voting rights
are determined by the amount of the claim, the value of the security and, in the case of share or membership rights, the share
of the subscribed capital of the debtor). However, if more than one class is formed, the restructuring plan can even be adopted
and become binding on creditors if creditor class(es) have not approved the plan, provided certain requirements are met and
the restructuring court confirms the restructuring plan (cross-class cramdown).

The Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act provides for additional tools that may be used by the debtor so as to facilitate
the preparation, negotiations and implementation of a restructuring plan. These tools include a stabilization order by the
restructuring court (which is granted upon the application by the debtor). Such stabilization order can restrict enforcement
measures by certain or all creditors. The stabilization order can initially be granted for a maximum period of up to three months,
with subsequent orders to extend the stabilization order up to a maximum of eight months subject to certain conditions being
satisfied.

For the holders of the Notes, among the relevant consequences of the use of any tools available under the Company Stabilization
and Restructuring Act by the Issuer, a German Guarantor or any other Guarantor having its center of main interest in Germany
would be the following:

  - the negotiation and drafting of a restructuring plan by the debtor is potentially subject to no or only limited review
and/or supervision by a court;

  - restrictions on individual enforcement or foreclosure actions for all or certain creditors for a period of up to eight
months due to a stabilization order;

  - any claims and rights of the holder of the Notes can be subject to and potentially be compromised by the restructuring
plan (e.g., in relation to claims in the form of a reduction in principal and/or interest or a deferral and in relation to
security rights in the form of a release and an adjustment of the ranking of the security right);

  - any collateral granted by the debtor as well as intra-group collateral may be subject to Restructuring Proceedings
potentially leading to a negative impact on the respective collateral; and

  - a restructuring plan can be adopted and the measures therein can become binding on any holder of the Notes without
the consent of each holder of the Notes and, if the prerequisites for a cross-class cram- down are fulfilled, even without
the consent of any of the holders of the Notes.

Restructuring plans which are public and confirmed by a German restructuring court will be recognized in any EU member
state pursuant to the Recast Insolvency Regulation as a recognized proceeding in Exhibit A of that Regulation. However, this
does not apply to plans in non-public restructuring matters under the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act as they are
not mentioned in Exhibit A of the Recast Insolvency Regulation. Except for public restructuring matters, the recognition of the
restructuring plan is subject to certain rules and regulations under applicable international private law.

**_Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests_**

The German Guarantors are incorporated and established in Germany in the form of a limited liability company (Gesellschaft
_mit beschränkter Haftung) (“GmbH”). Consequently, the Guarantees and security interests granted by the German Guarantors_


-----

are subject to certain provisions of the German Limited Liability Companies Act (Gesetz betreffend die Gesellschaften mit
_beschränkter Haftung—“GmbHG”). These provisions would also apply to any future Guarantor in the form of a GmbH, or in_
case of a private limited partnership with a limited liability company as general partner (Kommanditgesellschaft) (“GmbH &
Co. KG”) to its general partner.

Sections 30 and 31 of the GmbHG (“Sections 30 and 31”) prohibit a GmbH from disbursing its assets to its direct or indirect
shareholders, to the extent that the amount of the GmbH’s net assets (i.e., assets minus liabilities and liability reserves) is
already less or would fall below the amount of its stated share capital (Stammkapital); in case of a GmbH & Co. KG, such
provisions apply to the general partner which is a GmbH. The granting or enforcement of guarantees and/or security interests
by a GmbH or by a GmbH & Co. KG in order to guarantee or secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company
are considered disbursements under Sections 30 and 31. Therefore, in order to enable a GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG to issue
guarantees or grant security interests to secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of
violating Sections 30 and 31, it is standard market practice for indentures, credit agreements, guarantees and security documents
to contain “limitation language” in relation to subsidiaries in the legal form of a GmbH or GmbH & Co. KG. Pursuant to such
limitation language, the beneficiaries of the guarantees and security interests agree, subject to certain exemptions, to enforce
the guarantees and security interests against the GmbH or the GmbH & Co. KG only to the extent that such enforcement does
not result in the GmbH’s, or the KG’s general partner that is a GmbH, net assets falling below its stated share capital or, as the
case may be, if the net assets are already below the amount of its stated share capital, to cause such amount to be further
reduced. Accordingly, the Guarantees and security interests provided by a German Guarantor to secure the Notes will contain
such limitation language and therefore the enforcement of the Guarantees and the security interests securing the Notes is limited
in the manner described. This could lead to a situation in which the respective guarantee or security interest granted by a
German Guarantor cannot be enforced at all.

The limitation language for any GmbH or GmbH & Co. KG to be incorporated into the relevant Notes documents, in particular
in the Indenture, will substantially be in the form as follows (with a corresponding form to be included in the relevant security
documents):

(a) The restrictions in the guarantee clause of the Indenture relating to limitations for a German GmbH or KG
shall apply to any guarantee, indemnity, liability and other payment obligations under this Clause or any
other provision in the Indenture and/or any other documents in connection therewith granted by an Obligor
incorporated under the laws of Germany as a limited liability company (GmbH) (a “German GmbH
Guarantor”) to secure liabilities of its current or any future direct or indirect shareholder(s) (upstream) or a
Subsidiary of such shareholder (but excluding any direct or in-direct Subsidiary of such Obligor)
(cross-stream) (a “Guarantee”).

(b) The restrictions in the guarantee clause of the Indenture relating to limitations for a German GmbH or KG
shall not apply:

(i) with respect to a Capital Impairment (as defined below), to the extent the German GmbH Guarantor
secures any indebtedness under the Indenture in respect of (i) loans to the extent such loans are
(directly or indirectly) on-lent or otherwise passed on to the relevant German GmbH Guarantor or
its Subsidiaries or (ii) bank guarantees or letters of credit that are issued for the benefit of any of the
creditors of the German GmbH Guarantor or the German GmbH Guarantor’s Subsidiaries, in each
case, to the extent that any such on-lending or otherwise passing on or bank guarantees or letters of
credit are still outstanding at the time of the enforcement of the Guarantee; for the avoidance of
doubt, nothing in this paragraph (b) shall have the effect that such on-lent amounts may be enforced
multiple times (no double dip);

(ii) with respect to a Capital Impairment (as defined below), if, at the time of enforcement of the
Guarantee, a domination and/or profit and loss pooling agreement (Beherrschungs—und/oder
_Gewinnabführungsvertrag) as per Section 291 of the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz,_
_AktG) (either directly or indirectly through an unbroken chain of domination and/or profit transfer_
agreements) exists between the relevant German GmbH Guarantor as a dominated company, and:

(A) that German GmbH Guarantor is a Subsidiary of the relevant Obligor whose obligations
are secured by the relevant Guarantee, that Obligor; or

(B) the German GmbH Guarantor and the relevant Guarantor whose obligations are secured by
the relevant Guarantee are both Subsidiaries of a joint (direct or indirect) parent company
and such parent company as dominating entity (beherrschendes Unternehmen),


-----

in each case to the extent the existence of such domination and/or profit and loss pooling agreement
(Beherrschungs- und/oder Gewinnabführungsvertrag) leads to the inapplicability of section 30
paragraph 1 sentence 1 of the German Limited Liabilities Company Act (Gesetz betreffend die
_Gesellschaften mit beschränkter Haftung, GmbHG);_

(iii) with respect to a Capital Impairment (as defined below), to the extent the enforcement of the
Guarantee is covered (gedeckt) by a fully valuable and recoverable consideration or recourse claim
(vollwertiger Gegenleistungs—oder Rückgewähranspruch) of the German GmbH Guarantor against
the affiliate whose obligations are secured by the relevant Guarantee; or

(iv) if the relevant German GmbH Guarantor has not complied with its obligations pursuant to
paragraphs (d) and (e) below. However, if and to the extent that the Guarantee has been enforced
without regard to the restrictions contained in the guarantee clause of the Indenture relating to
limitations for a German GmbH or KG because the Management Notification and/or the Auditor’s
Determination (each as defined below) has not (or not in a timely manner) been delivered pursuant
to paragraphs (d) and (e) below, but the Auditor’s Determination has then been delivered within
four months from its due date in accordance with paragraph (e) below, the Trustee shall upon
demand of the German GmbH Guarantor repay any amount received from the German GmbH
Guarantor which pursuant to the Auditor’s Determination would not have been available for
enforcement, if the Auditor’s Determination had been delivered in a timely manner.

(c) The parties to the Indenture agree that if and to the extent the payment under the Guarantee would cause
(i) the amount of a German GmbH Guarantor’s Net Assets (as defined below), as calculated and defined
pursuant to paragraph (h) below, to fall below the amount required to maintain its registered share capital
(Stammkapital) or increase an existing shortage (Vertiefung einer Unterbilanz) of its registered share capital
(Stammkapital) and thereby violating sections 30, 31 GmbHG (such event, a “Capital Impairment”), or (ii) a
German GmbH Guarantor to be deprived of the liquidity necessary to fulfil its liabilities towards its creditors
and thereby violating Section 15b sub-section 5 of the German Insolvency Code (such event, a “Liquidity
Impairment”) then the Trustee shall not enforce and the German GmbH Guarantor shall, subject to paragraphs
(d) and (e) below, have a defence (Einrede) against any claim under the Guarantee if and to the extent such
Capital Impairment or Liquidity Impairment would occur.

(d) If the relevant German GmbH Guarantor does not notify the Trustee in (the “Management Notification”)
within fifteen (15) Business Days after the making of a demand against that German GmbH Guarantor under
the Guarantee:

(i) to what extent such Guarantee is an upstream or cross-stream guarantee or indemnity; and

(ii) to what extent a Capital Impairment or Liquidity Impairment would occur as a result of an
enforcement of the Guarantee (setting out in reasonable detail the amount of its Net Assets or to
which extent the liquidity would be deprived, providing an up-to-date pro forma balance sheet or
liquidity statement),

then the restrictions set out in the guarantee clause of the Indenture relating to limitations for a German GmbH
or KG shall cease to apply until a Management Notification has been provided.

(e) If the Trustee disagrees with the Management Notification, it may within twenty (20) Business Days of its
receipt, request the relevant German GmbH Guarantor to provide to the Trustee within forty-five
(45) Business Days of receipt of such request a determination by the Auditors or any other auditors of international standard and reputation (the “Auditor’s Determination”) appointed by the German GmbH Guarantor
(at its own cost and expense) setting out in reasonable detail the amount in which the payment under the
Guarantee would cause a Capital Impairment or Liquidity Impairment, subject to the terms set out under the
guarantee clause of the Indenture relating to limitations for a German GmbH or KG. Save for manifest errors,
the Auditor’s Determination shall be binding on all parties.

(f) If, after it has been provided with an Auditor’s Determination which prevented it from demanding any or
only partial payment under the Guarantee, the Trustee ascertains in good faith that the financial conditions
of the German GmbH Guarantor as set out in the Auditor’s Determination has substantially improved, the
Trustee may (acting reasonably), at the German GmbH Guarantor’s cost and expense, arrange for the
preparation of an updated balance sheet of the German GmbH Guarantor by applying the same principles


-----

that were used for the preparation of the Auditor’s Determination by the auditors who prepared the Auditor’s
Determination in order for such Auditors to determine whether (and, if so, to what extent) the Capital
Impairment and Liquidity Impairment has been cured as result of the improvement of the financial condition
of the German GmbH Guarantor. The Trustee may not arrange for the preparation of an Auditor’s
Determination prior to the expiry of three months from the date of the issuance of the preceding Auditor’s
Determination. The Trustee may only demand payment under the Guarantee to the extent the Auditors
determine that the Capital Impairment and Liquidity Impairment have been cured.

(g) The net assets (Reinvermögen) of the German GmbH Guarantor (the “Net Assets”) shall be calculated in
accordance with section 42 GmbHG and sections 242, 264 of the German Commercial Code
(Handelsgesetzbuch, HGB) and the generally accepted accounting principles applicable from time to time in
Germany (Grundsätze ordnungsgemäßer Buchführung) and for the purposes of calculating the Net Assets,
the following balance sheet items shall be adjusted as follows:

(i) the amount of any increase in the registered share capital of the relevant German GmbH Guarantor
which was carried out after the relevant German GmbH Guarantor became a party to this Agreement
and made from retained earnings (Kapitalerhöhung aus Gesellschaftsmitteln) shall be deducted
from the amount of the registered share capital (Stammkapital) of the relevant German GmbH
Guarantor if it is expressly prohibited under the Indenture and has been carried out without the prior
written consent of the Trustee;

(ii) the amount of non-distributable assets according to section 253 sub-section 6 HGB shall not be
included in the calculation of Net Assets;

(iii) the amount of non-distributable assets according to section 268 sub-section 8 HGB shall not be
included in the calculation of Net Assets;

(iv) the amount of non-distributable assets according to section 272 sub-section 5 HGB shall not be
included in the calculation of Net Assets; and

(v) loans or other liabilities incurred by the relevant German GmbH Guarantor in willful or grossly
negligent violation of the Indenture shall not be taken into account as liabilities.

(h) Where a German GmbH Guarantor claims in accordance with the provisions of the guarantee clause of the
Indenture relating to limitations for a German GmbH or KG that the Guarantee can only be enforced in a
limited amount, it shall:

(i) realize, to the extent lawful and within reasonable opinion commercially justifiable, any and all of
its assets that are shown in the balance sheet with a book value (Buchwert) that is significantly lower
than the market value of the assets and are not necessary (betriebsnotwendig) for the relevant
German GmbH Guarantor’s business; and

(ii) use best efforts to realize, to the extent legally permitted in a situation where it does not have
sufficient liquidity to fulfil its liabilities to its creditors, any and all of its assets if the relevant asset
is not necessary for the German GmbH Guarantor’s business (nicht betriebsnotwendig).

(i) Nothing in the guarantee clause of the Indenture relating to limitations for a German GmbH or KG shall
constitute a waiver (Verzicht) of any right granted under the Indenture to the Trustee or vice versa.

(j) Nothing in the guarantee clause of the Indenture relating to limitations for a German GmbH or KG shall
prevent the Trustee or a German GmbH Guarantor from claiming in court that the provision of this Guarantee
and/or making payments under this Guarantee by the German GmbH Guarantor does or does not fall within
the scope of sections 30, 31 of the GmbHG and/or section 15b sub-section 5 of the German Insolvency Code
and/or section 826 BGB.

(k) In addition to the restrictions set out in the guarantee clause of the Indenture relating to limitations for a
German GmbH or KG, if a German GmbH Guarantor demonstrates that, according to the decisions of
the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) or a higher regional court of appeals
(Oberlandesgericht), the enforcement of any upstream or cross-stream guarantee or security interest against
such German GmbH Guarantor would result in personal liability of its managing director(s)


-----

(Geschäftsführer) for a reimbursement of payments made under the Guarantee (including, without limitation,
pursuant to section 826 BGB), the German GmbH Guarantor shall have a defence (Einrede) against the
Guarantee to the extent required in order not to incur such liability.

(l) For the purposes of the guarantee clause of the Indenture relating to limitations for a German GmbH or KG,
a reference to a “German GmbH Guarantor” includes any limited liability company incorporated (or limited
partnership with a limited liability company as its general partner) in a jurisdiction other than Germany whose
center of main interest (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of Regulation (EU) No. 2015/848 of 20 May 2015
on Insolvency Proceedings (recast)) is in Germany.

In addition to the limitations resulting from the capital maintenance rules under Sections 30 and 31, the Guarantees and security
interests granted by the German Guarantor contain additional provisions limiting the enforcement in the event that the
enforcement would result in an illiquidity of the German Guarantor in case such illiquidity triggers liability risks for
management.

Sections 30 and 31, and the question of potential liability of management in case the enforcement triggers illiquidity, are subject
to evolving case law. We cannot assure you that future court rulings may not further limit the access of shareholders to assets
of the German Guarantors which can negatively affect the ability of the Issuer to make payments on the Notes, of the German
Guarantors to make payments on the Guarantees or the enforcement of the security interests granted by the German Guarantors.

In addition, it cannot be ruled out that the case law of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) regarding
“destructive interference” (existenzvernichtender Eingriff) (i.e., a situation in which a shareholder deprives a GmbH of assets
or the liquidity necessary for it to meet its own payment obligations) may be applied by courts with respect to the enforcement
of a guarantee or security interest granted by a German Guarantor. In such a case, the amount of proceeds to be realized in an
enforcement process may be reduced, even to nil. Moreover, according to a decision of the German Federal Supreme Court
(Bundesgerichtshof), a security agreement may be void due to tortious inducement of breach of contract if a creditor knows
about the stressed financial situation of the debtor and anticipates that the debtor will only be able to grant security by
disregarding the vital interests of its other business partners. It cannot be ruled out that German courts may apply this case law
with respect to the granting of the Guarantees or security interests by the German Guarantor.

Furthermore, the beneficiary of a transaction qualifying as a repayment of the stated share capital of a GmbH (e.g., the
enforcement of a guarantee or security interest granted by such GmbH or GmbH & Co. KG) could moreover become personally
liable under exceptional circumstances. The German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) ruled that this could be the
case if, for example, the creditor were to act with the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors
of the debtor in violation of the legal principle of _bonos mores_ (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present if the
beneficiary of the transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that the grantor of the guarantee or security interest
is close to collapse (Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire further with respect thereto.

**_Parallel Debt; Security Interests_**

Under German law, “certain accessory” security interests such as pledges (Pfandrechte) require that the pledgee and the creditor
of the secured claim be the same person. Such accessory security interests (akzessorische Sicherungsrechte) cannot be held on
behalf of third parties who do not (yet) hold the secured claim, will automatically lapse to the extent a secured claim is settled,
discharged or novated, and may not be assigned independently, but will automatically follow the claims they secure in case the
relevant secured claim is assigned. The holders of interests in the Notes from time to time will not be party to the Security
Documents. In order to permit the holders of the Notes from time to time to benefit from pledges granted to the Security Agent
under German law, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation of a “parallel debt.” Pursuant to the creation of
the parallel debt, the Security Agent has its own separate and independent claim equal to each amount payable by each obligor
under, in particular, the Notes and the Guarantees. The pledges governed by German law will directly and exclusively (to the
extent the Notes are concerned) secure the parallel debt rather than the obligations under the Notes or the holders of the Notes
directly. The validity of the parallel debt concept and of the pledges granted under German law to secure such parallel debt has
not been tested under German law, and there is no certainty that it will eliminate or mitigate the risk of unenforceability posed
by German law. Therefore, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted. In addition, holders of
the Notes bear some risk associated with a possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent.

German law does not generally permit the appropriation of pledged assets by the pledgee upon enforcement of the pledge. The
enforcement of a share pledge under German law usually requires the sale of the asset constituting the collateral through a
formal process involving a public auction to which certain waiting periods and notice requirements apply. Under German law,
it is unclear whether the security interest in the collateral gives the Security Agent the right to prevent other creditors of the
entities having granted such security from foreclosing on and realizing the asset constituting the collateral. Some courts have


-----

held that certain types of security interests only give their holders priority (according to their ranking) in the distribution of any
proceeds from the realization of the asset constituting the collateral and no right to intervene (i.e., the right to request the court
to impose a stay on proceedings initiated by other creditors).

**Italy**

**_Introduction_**

The insolvency laws of Italy may not be as favorable to investors’ interests as those of other jurisdictions with which investors
may be familiar. In Italy, courts play a central role in the insolvency process. Moreover, in court procedures may be materially
more complex and the enforcement of security interests by creditors in Italy can be more time-consuming than in equivalent
situations in jurisdictions with which holders of the Notes may be familiar.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in Italy, which does not include special provisions
applying to banks, insurance and other companies authorized to carry out certain reserved activities nor does it provide a
comprehensive description of insolvency laws applicable to public companies.

Italian insolvency laws and regulations have recently undergone a major reform. In particular, the Italian government approved
on January 12, 2019 the Italian Legislative Decree No. 14 of January 12, 2019, implementing the guidelines contained in the
Italian Law No. 155 dated October 19, 2017 and containing the scheme of a comprehensive legal framework in order to regulate,
_inter alia, insolvency matters, which was published in the Gazzetta Ufficiale on February 14, 2019 no. 38—Suppl._ _Ordinario_
no. 6 and came into force on July 15, 2022 (so called “Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency,” hereinafter, as subsequently
amended and supplemented, including by the Italian Legislative Decree No. 147 of October 26, 2020 and the Italian Legislative
Decree No. 83 of 17 June 2022 implementing the EU Directive 2019/1023, the “Italian Insolvency Code”). The main
innovations introduced by the Italian Insolvency Code include: (i) the elimination of the term “bankrupt” (fallito) due to its
negative connotation and the replacement of bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento) with a judicial liquidation (liquidazione
_giudiziale); (ii) a new definition of “state of crisis”; (iii) the adoption of the same procedural framework in order to ascertain_
such state of crisis and to access the different restructuring tools and frameworks (strumenti di regolazione della crisi e
_dell’insolvenza della società) provided for by the same Italian Insolvency Code; (iv) a new set of rules concerning group_
restructurings; (v) restrictions to the use of the pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo) in order to
favor going concern proceedings; (vi) a new crisis settlement procedure (composizione negoziata della crisi); (vii) jurisdiction
of specialized courts over proceedings involving large debtors; (viii) the adoption of definition of debtor’s “center of main
interest” as provided in the new set of rules concerning group restructurings, (ix) the introduction of the restructuring plan
subject to sanctioning (piano di ristrutturazione soggetto ad omologazione) among the restructuring tools and frameworks
(strumenti di regolazione della crisi e dell’insolvenza della società); (x) the regulation of adequate measures and plans to early
detect a crisis with specific criteria to be adopted by companies; and (xi) amendments to certain provisions of the Italian Civil
Code aimed at ensuring the general effectiveness of the reform.

The Italian Insolvency Code has been amended and supplemented by, among others, (i) the Italian Legislative Decree No. 147
of October 26, 2020, and (ii) the Italian Legislative Decree No. 83 of June 17, 2022.

Except for minor changes in some provisions of the Italian Civil Code, which already entered into force on March 16, 2019, in
response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the entry into force of the Italian Insolvency Code has been initially postponed to
September 1, 2021 by the “Decreto liquidità” (i.e., Law Decree April 8, 2020, no. 23, published in the Gazzetta Ufficiale on
April 8, 2020 and converted in law by the Italian Parliament by the Law June 5, 2020, no. 40, published in the Gazzetta Ufficiale
on June 6, 2020 the “Liquidity Decree”), and is now effective starting from July 15, 2022.

Provisions under the Italian Royal Decree No. 267 of March 16, 1942 (the former main Italian bankruptcy legislation) as in
force at the time (the “Italian Bankruptcy Law”) continue to apply only to any filings for bankruptcy declarations and proposals
of bankruptcy restructuring plans (concordato fallimentare) and any filings of petitions seeking for the approval of debt
restructuring agreements _(accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti) and/or for the opening of a composition with creditors_
proceeding (concordato preventivo) filed or pending before July 15, 2022 (i.e. the effective date of the Italian Insolvency Code).

Please find below a brief description of the main provisions of the Italian Insolvency Code after its entry force on July 15, 2022
which supersedes the Italian Bankruptcy Law.

The two primary aims of the Italian Insolvency Code are to liquidate the debtor’s assets and protect the goodwill of the going
concern (if any) for the satisfaction of creditors’ claims. The aim of the “Prodi-bis” procedure or “Marzano” procedure (which
remain available to large companies also in the context of the new set of rules, as will be further detailed below), is to maintain


-----

employment. These competing aims often have been balanced by the sale of businesses as going concerns and ensuring that
employees are transferred along with the businesses being sold.

Under the Italian Insolvency Code, the judicial liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale) must be declared by a court, based on the
insolvency (insolvenza) of a debtor upon a petition filed by the debtor itself, the public prosecutor and/or one or more creditors.
Insolvency, as defined under Article 2, letter (b) of the Italian Insolvency Code, is defined as the state of the debtor, manifested
by defaults and/or other external elements evidencing that the debtor is no longer able to regularly meet its obligations as they
come due. This must be a permanent, and not a temporary status of insolvency, in order for a court to hold that a debtor is
insolvent. The Italian Insolvency Code also introduced a specific concept of crisis, which is defined under Article 2, letter (a)
of the Italian Insolvency Code as the state of the debtor such that it is likely that insolvency will follow, which is manifested
by the inadequacy of prospective cash flows to meet obligations in the following 12 months. Both insolvency and crisis are
factual situations upon the occurrence of which different instruments provided for by the Italian Insolvency Code may be
activated.

In cases where a debtor is facing financial difficulties or temporary cash shortfall and, in general, a state of crisis/financial
distress, it may be possible for it to enter into out-of-court arrangements with its creditors, which may safeguard the existence
of the debtor, but which are susceptible of being reviewed by a court in the event of a subsequent insolvency, and possibly
challenged as voidable transactions.

The following debt restructuring and insolvency alternatives are available under Italian law for debtors in a state of crisis
and for insolvent debtors and, in certain cases, also to debtors experiencing an economic or financial imbalance such as to make
it likely that a state of crisis and/or distress or their insolvency will occur.

**_Restructuring outside of a judicial process (accordi stragiudiziali)_**

Restructuring generally takes place through a formal judicial process because it is more favorable for the debtor and because
out-of-court arrangements put in place as a result of an out-of-court restructuring are vulnerable to being reviewed by a court
in the event of a subsequent insolvency, and possibly challenged as voidable transactions, and may trigger liabilities in the
event of a subsequent bankruptcy. However, in cases where a company is solvent, but facing financial difficulties, it may be
possible to enter into an out-of-court arrangement with its creditors, which may safeguard the existence of the company.

**_Composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa pursuant to the Italian Insolvency Code_**

The composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa was originally introduced in the Italian legal framework by
the Italian Law Decree No. 118/2021 and has been subsequently incorporated into the Italian Insolvency Code.

It is an out-of-court proceeding, but the court can be involved in the two following circumstances:

(i) pursuant to Article 19 of the Italian Insolvency Code, when the debtor, by the day following the publication
of the relevant request and of the acceptance of the Expert (as defined below) in the relevant Companies’
Register (Registro delle Imprese), files a petition requesting the competent court to confirm or modify the
protective measures provided for pursuant to Article 18 of the Italian Insolvency Code (i.e., the interested
creditors being barred from obtaining preemption rights (diritti di prelazione) unless agreed upon by the
debtor and a stay on all individual enforcement and interim actions) (the “Protective Measures”), and, if
necessary, to enact the interim measures necessary to complete the negotiations (the “Interim Measures”),
and

(ii) when the debtor files a petition asking the court to authorize certain acts in line with the provisions set forth
under Article 22 of the Italian Insolvency Code.

The composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa is a proceeding aimed at facilitating the recovery of debtors
which despite being in conditions of asset or economic and financial imbalance such as to make it likely that financial distress
or insolvency will occur, have the potential to remain in the market, including through the sale of the business or a branch of
it.

According to Article 12 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa can
be pursued by enterprises, either commercial (imprenditore commerciale) and agricultural (imprenditore agricolo), which are
undergoing a distressed situation with reference to their assets, their business and/or their financial situation, such that it is
likely that a distress/crisis or insolvency will follow. It is, therefore, a procedure aiming at anticipating further deterioration of
the debtor’s situation. The debtor filing for a _composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa, inter alia,_ (i)


-----

pursuant to Article 17, paragraph 3, letter d) of the Italian Insolvency Code, shall certify that no judicial liquidation proceedings
or similar proceedings are pending towards itself nor it has filed requests for the admission to the procedures provided for under
Article 40 of the Italian Insolvency Code, including pursuant to Articles 44, paragraph 1, letter a) and 54, paragraph 3, and (ii)
in the event that the application for a composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa is dismissed may not submit
a new request before one year has elapsed after dismissal (in the case where such dismissal is requested by the debtor within
two months from the appointment of the Expert (as defined below), the term for submitting a new request is reduced to four
months).

Pursuant to Article 25 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa may
also apply to groups of companies, which may commence one proceeding all together. It should be noted that paragraph 9 of
such provision provides for the group companies—at the end of the negotiations—to either enter into one of the agreements
referred to in Article 23, paragraph 1 of the Italian Insolvency Code as a group, or use one of the tools referred to under Article
23 of the Italian Insolvency Code, either separately or as a whole group. The _composizione negoziata per la soluzione della_
_crisi d’impresa is commenced on a voluntary basis only, filing of a petition for the appointment of a third party and independent_
expert (the “Expert”) to the secretary general of the relevant chamber of commerce by way of a dedicated electronic platform
(the “Platform”). Pending a proceedings pursuant to Article 40 of the Italian Insolvency Code relating to access to a different
in – Court reorganization or restructuring tool, or having such a proceedings being renounced in the priori fourth months, the
petition cannot be filed Pursuant to Article 16 of the Italian Insolvency Code the person who acted as Expert in the context of
such proceeding, shall not have or maintain professional relations with the debtor during the two years following the termination
of the negotiated proceeding.

The Expert is appointed within five days upon the filing of the request. The Expert is responsible for facilitating and managing
the negotiations between the debtor, its creditors and any other interested parties, in order to identify a solution to overcome
the crisis or the insolvency, including through the transfer of the business or a branch thereof.

The Expert assesses his/her own independence, the adequacy of his/her own professional expertise and his/ her own time
availability with respect to the prospected assignment, and, if the outcome of the assessment is positive, notifies his/her
acceptance to the debtor and uploads it on the Platform. In case of negative outcome, the Expert confidentially notifies it to the
commission, which appoints a new Expert. If the Expert accepts the appointment, he/she meets with the debtor in order to
assess whether there are concrete and real chances of recovery. The debtor attends the meeting personally, and can be assisted
by its advisors.

If the Expert finds that there are concrete and real chances of recovery (risanamento), he/she meets with the parties involved
in the debtor’s recovery process and presents the possible strategies, scheduling periodic meetings close in time to one another.
During the negotiations, all the parties involved must act in good faith and with fairness, must cooperate and are bound by
confidentiality on the debtor’s situation, on the actions carried out or planned by the debtor and on the information received in
the course of the negotiations. The debtor must provide a complete and clear representation of his/her situation and manage
his/her assets without causing unfair prejudice to the creditors. Banks and financial intermediaries, their agents, and, in case of
credit assignment and/or transfer, their assignees or transferees, must take part in the negotiations actively and in an informed
manner, and the access to the _composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa_ does not, by itself, constitute
ground for suspension or withdrawal of overdraft facilities (which may, however, occur if required under the prudential
supervision regulation (disciplina di vigilanza prudenziale)). Specific provisions apply to negotiations involving employment
contracts.

If the Expert finds that there are no real chances of recovery (risanamento), after the meeting with the debtor or thereafter,
he/she has to promptly notify the debtor and the secretary general of the chamber of commerce, which provides for the dismissal
of the debtor’s petition. The Expert’s appointment is considered terminated if, after 180 days from its appointment, the parties
have not agreed on a solution (that can also be proposed by the Expert) for overcoming the debtor’s distressed situation.
However, the Expert’s appointment can continue up to further 180 days (pursuant to Article 17, paragraph 7 of the Italian
Insolvency Code) if (i) all the parties involved in the negotiations require so and the Expert agrees, or (ii) the prosecution of
the appointment is required by the fact that the debtor has filed a petition to the court pursuant to Article 19 and/ or Article 22
of the Italian Insolvency Code.

Pursuant to Article 17, paragraph 8 of the Italian Insolvency Code, at the end of his/her appointment the Expert issues a final
report (the “Final Report”), uploads it on the Platform, and notifies it to the debtor and to the court that has granted the
Protective Measures and Interim Measures (if any) which declares the termination of their related effects.

Pursuant to Article 18 of the Italian Insolvency Code, together with the petition for appointment of the Expert, or with a
subsequent petition, the debtor can request the application of Protective Measures, which may also be limited, upon debtor


-----

request, to certain creditors’ claims or to a specific category of creditors. The Protective Measures consist of the following:
from the date of publication of the relevant petition, preexisting creditors cannot obtain preemption rights (diritti di prelazione)
unless agreed upon by the entrepreneur and all enforcement and interim actions are stayed. However, as opposed to what
happens in the concordato preventivo, payment of preexisting creditors is not forbidden. The Protective Measures do not apply
to employees’ claims.

From the date of publication of the petition requesting the application of the Protective Measures until the date of conclusion
of the negotiations or dismissal of the petition for the composizione negoziata, the ruling of opening of the judicial liquidation
proceeding (sentenza di apertura della liquidazione giudiziale) or the debtor cannot be declared insolvent by the court, unless
it revokes the Protective Measures.

The creditors whose rights are affected by the Protective Measures cannot unilaterally refuse to perform their obligations under
the contracts in place with the debtor, nor terminate such contracts, nor anticipate their expiration date, nor amend them with
detrimental consequences for the debtor, solely on the ground of the missed payment of claims arisen prior to the publication
of the petition requesting the application of the Protective Measures. However, the creditors may suspend the fulfilment of the
pending contracts from the publication of the petition requesting Protective Measures to the court’s confirmation of such
Protective Measures.

If the debtor applies for the Protective Measures (which, as said, are effective immediately, upon publication of the relevant
request in the companies’ register), it shall - within the next day - file a confirmation/amendment request to the competent
court, in order to allow a judge to check the said measures and to confirm them or, if necessary, to modify them. In the absence
of such request, the Protective Measures will become ineffective.

The duration of the Protective Measures and, if necessary, the Interim Measures, is established by an order of the court in a
range between 30 and 120 days, and, upon request of the parties and after obtaining the opinion of the Expert, can be extended
for the time required to positively finalize the negotiations up to a maximum of 240 days, given that the judge may discretionary
order the revocation of such Protective Measures or shorten their duration.

During the procedure the debtor remains able to continue the ordinary and extraordinary management of the company, subject
to certain conditions. More precisely, pursuant to Article 21 of the Italian Insolvency Code, pending the negotiations, the debtor
may carry out acts pertaining to ordinary activity, and, upon written notice to the Expert, carry out acts pertaining to
extraordinary activity or make payments non-consistent with the negotiations nor with the perspectives of recovery, in such a
way as to avoid prejudicing the economic and financial sustainability of the business. Furthermore, if during the course of the
negotiations, it appears that the debtor is insolvent but there are real prospects of recovery, the debtor shall manage the enterprise
in the best interests of the creditors, without prejudice to the relevant liabilities.

If the Expert believes that a certain act causes prejudice to the creditors, to the negotiations or to the perspectives of recovery,
he/she reports it in writing to the debtor and to the debtor’s control body. If, notwithstanding the Expert’s report, the debtor
carries out the relevant act, it shall give immediate notice to the Expert, who may file his/her dissent for the registration with
the companies’ register. At the request of the debtor or of one or more creditors or upon notification from the Expert, the Court
that has granted the Protective Measures and/or Interim Measures may, at any time, revoke such measures or reduce their
duration when they do not meet the aim of ensuring the positive outcome of the negotiations or they appear disproportionate
in relation to the prejudice caused to the creditors, pursuant to Article 19, paragraph 6 of the Italian Insolvency Code. If the
Protective Measures are revoked, the prohibition on the obtainment of preemption rights by preexisting creditors ceases to be
effective from the date on which the Protective Measures are revoked.

Pursuant to Article 22 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the court, upon the entrepreneur’s request and to the extent that this is
consistent with the continuation of the business as a going concern and with the maximization of the creditors’ recovery, may
authorize:

(i) the debtor or one or more debtors belonging to the same corporate group to incur new super-senior
(prededucibile) indebtedness pursuant to Article 6 of the Italian Insolvency Code;

(ii) the debtor to incur new super-senior (prededucibile) indebtedness pursuant to Article 6 of the Italian
Insolvency Code via shareholders’ financing; and

(iii) the debtor to transfer its business, or certain business branches, without the effects provided under Article
2560, paragraph 2, of the Italian Civil Code, without prejudice to Article 2112 of the Italian Civil Code.
However, in such case it will be for the court itself to identify the measures it considers appropriate, taking


-----

also into account the requests of the parties concerned, in order to protect all the interests involved. The court
shall also verify the compliance with the competitiveness principle in choosing the purchaser.

Pursuant to Article 23 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa can
terminate as follow:

(i) execution of an agreement between the debtor and one or more creditors, which constitutes cause for
application of the reward measures provided under Article 25-bis, paragraph 1 of the Italian Insolvency Code
if, according to the Expert’s Final Report, such agreement ensures the continuation of the business as a going
concern for at least 2 years;

(ii) execution of a standstill agreement (convenzione di moratoria) pursuant to Article 62 of the Italian Insolvency
Code;

(iii) execution of an agreement signed by the debtor, by the creditors and by the Expert, with the effects provided
under Articles 166, paragraph 3, lett. d) and 324. With such agreement the Expert acknowledges that the
reorganization plan (piano di risanamento) seems to be consistent with the composition of the crisis or
insolvency.

At the end of the negotiations, if none of the above mentioned agreement is executed, the debtor may alternatively:

(i) arrange an out-of-court reorganization plan (piano attestato di risanamento) pursuant to Article 56 of the
Italian Insolvency Code;

(ii) file a petition requesting the sanctioning of a debt restructuring agreement with creditors (accordo di
_ristrutturazione dei debiti) pursuant to Articles 57, 60 and 61 of the Italian Insolvency Code. The percentage_
referred to under Article 61, paragraph 2, letter c) of the Italian Insolvency Code is reduced to 60% if the
achievement of the agreement results from the Final Report of the Expert;

(iii) file a petition for admission to the concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio provided for
pursuant to Article 25-sexies of the Italian Insolvency Code;

(iv) enter into one of the insolvency proceedings provided under the Italian Insolvency Code or in the so-called
Prodi-bis procedure or the Marzano procedure.

Furthermore, pursuant to Article 24 of the Italian Insolvency Code:

(i) the acts authorized by the court pursuant to Article 22 of the Italian Insolvency Code shall maintain their
effects in the event of subsequent sanctioned debt restructuring agreement with creditors (accordo di
_ristrutturazione dei debiti omologato), sanctioned court-supervised pre-judicial liquidation composition with_
creditors (concordato preventivo omologato), opening of the judicial liquidation proceeding (apertura della
_liquidazione giudiziale), a sanctioned restructuring plan provided for pursuant to Article 64-bis of the Italian_
Insolvency Code, a compulsory administrative winding-up (liquidazione coatta amministrativa),
extraordinary administration for large insolvent companies (amministrazione straordinaria) or simplified
pre-judicial liquidation composition with creditors agreement aimed at the liquidation of the debtor’s assets
(concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio) provided for pursuant to Article 25-sexies of
the Italian Insolvency Code;

(ii) the payments, the acts (atti) and the granting of security interests made after the Expert accepted its
appointment, are exempted from claw-back actions pursuant to Article 166, paragraph 2, of the Italian
Insolvency Code if they were consistent with the development and the status of the negotiations and with the
perspectives of recovery (risanamento) in place at the time the payment/transaction/granting of security
interest was made;

(iii) acts pertaining to the debtor’s extraordinary activity and payments made after the Expert accepted its
appointment are subject to claw-back actions pursuant to Article 165 and Article 166 of the Italian Insolvency
Code if the Expert has registered his/her dissent in the companies’ register pursuant to Article 21, paragraph
4 of the Italian Insolvency Code or if the competent court has denied its authorization pursuant to Article 22
of the Italian Insolvency Code; and


-----

(iv) payment and transactions made after the Expert accepted its appointment, which the Expert assesses to be
consistent with the development of the negotiations and with the perspectives of recovery (risanamento) of
the debtor, or which have been authorized by the court pursuant to Article 22 of the Italian Insolvency Code,
benefit of exemptions from the potential application of certain criminal sanctions.

**_Potential outcomes: concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio_**

Article 25-sexies of the Italian Insolvency Code introduces a simplified court-supervised pre-judicial liquidation composition
with creditors with liquidation purpose (concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio).

If, in its Final Report, in the context of a composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa proceeding, the Expert
states that the negotiations did not have a positive outcome (i.e. the debtor was not able to reach an agreement with its creditors)
but have been conducted according to fairness and good faith and that the options provided under Article 23, paragraphs 1 and
2, letter b), of the Italian Insolvency Code are not feasible, within 60 days following the notification of the Final Report the
debtor may file to the competent court where it has its center of main interests a petition for admission to the _concordato_
_semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio, together with a liquidation plan and the documents listed under Article 39 of_
the Italian Insolvency Code. The petition for concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio is then published in
the companies’ register within the day following the filing with the court. From the date of such publication, the effects provided
under Articles 6, 46, 94 and 96 of the Italian Insolvency Code are produced.

Following the filing of such application, the court (i) appoints a so-called “auxiliary” (ausiliario) to, _inter alia, express an_
opinion on the debtor’s proposal; (ii) orders that the proposal, together with the opinion of the auxiliary and the Final Report
of the Expert, are delivered by the debtor to the creditors appearing on the list filed by the debtor itself; and (iii) sets the date
of the hearing for the court approval (omologazione). Creditors and any third party with an interest in the proceeding are entitled
to object to the court approval (omologazione) within ten days before the date fixed for the hearing.

If the court, having verified the legitimacy of the objection and the procedure, as well as compliance with priority creditor
claims and the feasibility of the liquidation plan, finds that the proposal does not prejudice the creditors with respect to the
alternative of a judicial winding-up liquidation and that, in any event, it ensures a benefit to each creditor, it approves the
composition with creditors proposal by decree, by which it shall also appoint a liquidator.

The court issues a decree of approval (omologazione) of the concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio when
it finds that (i) the proceeding has been carried out in accordance with relevant laws and regulations and the adversarial principle
among the parties (contraddittorio); (ii) the proposal is compliant with preemption rights (cause di prelazione) and the
liquidation plan is feasible, and (iii) the proposal does not cause a prejudice to the creditors compared to what they would
receive in case of judicial liquidation of the debtor, and in any case ensures that each creditor receives a certain recovery. With
the approval decree, the court also appoints a liquidator.

The parties may file an objection (opposizione) to the abovementioned decree within 30 days after having been notified of the
same.

Pursuant to Article 25-septies of the Italian Civil Code, the liquidation plan may also include an offer by a pre-identified third
party to transfer the business or one or more branches of the business or specific assets to such third party, even before the
approval: in this case, the judicial liquidator, having verified the absence of better solutions on the market, may implement the
offer.

**_Out-of-court reorganization plans (piani attestati di risanamento) pursuant to Article 56 of the Italian Insolvency Code_**

Out-of-court agreements are based on restructuring plans (piani attestati di risanamento) addressed to the creditors and
prepared by debtors who are either insolvent or in a state of crisis, in order to restructure their indebtedness and to ensure the
recovery of their financial condition. An independent expert appointed directly by the debtor and enrolled in the Register of
Auditors and Accounting Experts (Registro dei Revisori Legali) must verify the feasibility of the reorganization plan and the
truthfulness of the business data provided by the company. There is no need to obtain court approval to appoint the independent
expert. The independent expert must possess certain specific professional requisites and qualifications and meet the
requirements set forth by Article 2399 of the Italian Civil Code and may be subject to liability in case of misrepresentation or
false certification.

Out-of-court restructuring plans and the relevant arrangements are not under any form of judicial control or approval and,
therefore, no application is required to be filed with the court or supervising authority. Also, out-of-court agreements are not
required to be approved and consented to by a specific majority of all outstanding claims.


-----

The terms and conditions of these out-of-court restructuring plans are freely negotiable, provided they are finalized at
restructuring the debtor’s indebtedness and rebalancing its capital structure. However, the possibility to adopt such tools to
liquidate the debtor is disputed, as it is argued they shall provide for the restructuring of the debtor’s indebtedness and the
rebalancing of its financial condition on a going concern basis. Unlike court supervised compositions with creditors and debt
restructuring agreements, out-of-court reorganization plans do not offer the debtor any protection against enforcement
proceedings and/or precautionary actions of third-party creditors. The Italian Insolvency Code provides that, should these plans
fail, and the debtor be declared insolvent, the payments and/or acts carried out, and/or security interest granted on the debtor’s
assets for the implementation of the reorganization plan, subject to certain conditions (a) are not subject to any claw-back action
(azione revocatoria), including the claw-back action provided for pursuant to Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code, as provided
for pursuant to Article 166, paragraph 3, letter d) of the Italian Insolvency Code; and (b) are exempted from the potential
application of certain criminal sanctions. Neither ratification by the court nor publication in the Companies’ Register are needed
(although publication in the Companies’ Register of the plan, the report by the independent expert and the agreement is possible
upon a debtor’s request and would allow certain tax benefits), and, therefore, the risk of bad publicity or disvalue judgments
are lower than in case of a court supervised composition with creditors or a debt restructuring agreement. Since the
reorganization plan (or the agreements entered into to implement it) is not subject to any court approval or judicial review, it
cannot be excluded that the abovementioned exemption effects will be challenged in the event of subsequent judicial
liquidation, if the competent court were to assess that the reorganization plan was not feasible at the time it was certified by the
independent expert.

Unlike Italian Bankruptcy Law, the Italian Insolvency Code sets forth specific rules regarding out-of-court reorganization plans
and the relevant agreements entered into with creditors, which must be followed for the plans and agreements to grant protection
against claw-back actions and potential civil and criminal responsibilities. More in detail, out-of- reorganization plans pursuant
to Article 56 of the Italian Insolvency Code must be supported by adequate documentation representing the financial and
commercial situation of the debtor and which also needs to indicate, among others, the causes of the crisis, the new resources
which will be made available to the debtor and the industrial plan. Moreover, they must be suitable for the purpose of assuring
the restructuring of the indebtedness of the debtor and rebalancing its financial position and, in case of its failure and subsequent
challenge (impugnazione) before an Italian court, they must not be deemed as being unreasonable.

**_Debt restructuring agreements with creditors (accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti) pursuant to Article 57 of the Italian_**
**_Insolvency Code_**

Debt restructuring agreements with creditors (accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti) provided for pursuant to Article 57 and
ff. of the Italian Insolvency Code may be entered into by the debtor with creditors holding at least 60% of the outstanding
indebtedness, to be sanctioned (omologato) by the competent court. An independent expert appointed by the debtor must assess
the truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by the company and declare and that the agreement is feasible
and, particularly, that it ensures that the indebtedness vis-à-vis non-participating creditors can be fully satisfied in a 120-day
term from: (i) the date of sanctioning (omologazione) of the agreement by the court, in the case of debts which are due and
payable to the non-participating creditors as of the date of the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement
by the court; and (ii) the date on which the relevant debts fall due, in case of debts which are not yet due and payable to the
non-participating creditors as at the date of the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement by the court.
Pursuant to Article 57 of the Italian Insolvency Code, only a debtor who is insolvent or facing a state of crisis (as described
above) can initiate this process and request the court’s sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement entered
into with its creditors.

The agreement is published in the companies’ register and becomes effective as of the day of its publication. Creditors and
other interested parties may challenge the agreement within 30 days from the publication of the agreement in the companies’
register. After having settled with the opposition (if any), the court will validate (omologare) the agreement by issuing
a decree, which can be appealed within 30 days of its publication pursuant to Article 51 of the Italian Insolvency Code.

The Italian Insolvency Code does not expressly provide for any indications concerning the contents of the debt restructuring
agreement. The plan can therefore provide, inter alia, either for the debtor or a third party carrying out the business, or for the
sale of the business, and may contain refinancing agreements, moratoria, write offs and/or postponements of claims. The debt
restructuring agreement may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes. Article
58, paragraph 1 of the Italian Insolvency Code sets the rule for when substantial amendments are made to the plan. More
precisely, in the event of substantial amendments to the plan before the approval, the report issued by the expert and the
consent to the debt restructuring agreement expressed by creditors shall be renewed. The report shall also be renewed in the
event of substantial amendments to the agreement. In the event substantial amendments need to be made to the plan after the
approval, the debtor shall make such amendments as are appropriate to ensure the implementation of the agreements, requesting
the update of the certified report issued by the expert having the requirements set forth in Article 57, paragraph 4 of the Italian


-----

Insolvency Code. In this case, the renewed certified report, together with the amended plan, shall be published in the
companies’ register, giving appropriate notice to the creditors by registered letter or by certified email (PEC). The parties may
file an objection (opposizione) within 30 days after having been notified.

_The key features of a debt restructuring agreement_

With the petition for the approval by the court of the debt restructuring agreement, the debtor may request to be granted
protective measures (e.g. a stay on individual enforcement and interim actions) – additional protective measures can be
requested at any time pending the procedure. Such measures can also be requested (i) pursuant to Article 54, paragraph 3 of
the Italian Insolvency Code, to the court by the debtor pending negotiations with creditors (i.e., prior to the filing of the petition
for approval of the agreement), subject to certain conditions, or (ii) pursuant to Article 44 of the Italian Insolvency Code,
together with a pre-petition for the access to one of the restructuring tools provided for by the Italian Insolvency Code.
According to Article 54, paragraph 2, of the Italian Insolvency Code, provided that the petition for approval of the debt
restructuring agreement includes the relevant request for measures, from the date of publication of the petition in the companies’
registrer, it is prohibited to commence or continue the enforcement and the conservative actions (or, in any event, to take any
initiatives prohibited under the relevant measures). No dispossession of debtor occurs in respect of a debt restructuring
agreement, but the court may appoint a judicial commissioner to oversee the proceedings and must do so in case petitions for
the opening of judicial liquidation are pending, when it is necessary for the protection of the parties who filed such petitions. It
is a court-supervised procedure, which can take from a few months up to more than a year (the duration of the proceedings are
generally influenced by challenges). Creditors entering into the debt restructuring agreement are not required to receive the
same treatment (i.e., they are free to reject the proposal and to protect their interests otherwise) and no cram-down is applicable
to third-party non-adhering creditors, who shall be fully re-paid within 120 days from validation (omologa) of the debt
restructuring agreement (if the claims are already due and payable at such date) or within 120 days from the respective maturity
date if such creditors’ claims are not yet due as of the validation date of such debt restructuring agreement as per respectively
Article 57, paragraph 3 letters a) and b) (but see below with regards to debt restructuring agreements with extended effects
(accordi di ristrutturazione ad efficacia estesa)).

Creditors and other interested parties may file an opposition to the approval of the debt restructuring agreement within 30 days
from the publication of the relevant petition in the companies’ register. At such hearing, the court decides upon any opposition
and assesses whether the conditions for the approval are met.

Pursuant to the Article 61 of the Italian Insolvency Code, debtors are entitled to enter into a debt restructuring agreement by
obtaining the approval of creditors representing at least 75% of the credits belonging to the same category (with respect to the
homogeneity of their status and economic interests) and can request the court to declare that agreement binding on the nonadhering creditors belonging to the same category (so called “cram down”).

More in detail, debt restructuring agreements with extended effects (accordi di ristrutturazione ad efficacia estesa) provided
pursuant to Article 61 of the Italian Insolvency Code which were previously only permitted in relation to debts owed to banks
and financial intermediaries where such debts represented at least 50% of the total indebtedness can now be applied to any
category of creditors provided that, inter alia: (i) all the creditors belonging to the same category have been informed of the
start of the negotiations and have been able to participate in them in good faith and have received complete and up-to-date
information on the debtor’s assets, economic and financial situation as well as on the restructuring agreement and its effects;
(ii) the agreement provides for the continuation of the business activity either directly or indirectly pursuant to Article 84 of
the Italian Insolvency Code; (iii) the claims of the consenting creditors belonging to a same category represent at least 75% of
all the claims belonging to the same category, it being understood that a creditor may hold claims in more than one category;
(iv) the non-adhering creditors belonging to the same category to which the effects of the agreement are extended can be
satisfied under the agreement for an amount not lower than the amount they would receive in the judicial liquidation; and (v)
the debtor has notified the agreement, the application for court approval and the documents attached thereto to the creditors to
be crammed down. The percentage of 75% is lowered to 60% if the debt restructuring agreement is referred to in the Final
Report issued by the Expert at the end of the negotiations pertaining to the composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi
_d’impresa._

Moreover, pursuant to Article 61, paragraph 5, of the Italian Insolvency Code, a special provision is set forth for debtors whose
financial indebtedness is at least 50% of their total indebtedness: in this situation the debt restructuring agreement may identify
one or more categories of creditors which are banks and financial intermediaries which have a homogeneous legal position and
economic interests and extend the effects of the agreement to non-participating creditors who are part of the same category. In
such instance, the agreement may also not contemplate the direct or indirect continuation of the business activity as a going
concern. However, in such case the rights of creditors who are not banks or financial intermediaries remain unaffected.


-----

Similarly, pursuant to the new Article 62 of the Italian Insolvency Code, a standstill agreement (convenzione di moratoria)
entered into between a debtor and its creditors representing 75% of the same class would also bind the non-participating
creditors, provided that: (A) pursuant to Article 62, paragraph 2, lett. d) of the Italian Insolvency Code, an independent expert
has been appointed and certifies (i) the truthfulness of the business data, (ii) the attitude of the standstill agreement to
temporarily regulate the effects of the crisis and (iii) the fact that there is a concrete possibility that non- adherent creditors who
are in the same category, and to whom the effects of the agreement are extended, may be satisfied at the outcome of the
agreement to an extent not less than the judicial liquidation, and (B) certain further conditions are met (e.g., all the creditors
belonging to the relevant category have been duly notified of the beginning of the negotiations, have been made able to
participate in the negotiations and have received complete and up-to-date information on the debtor’s assets, economic and
financial situation and on the agreement and its related effects). Non-adhering crammed-down creditors can challenge the
standstill agreement within 30 days after having been notified of the same.

In no case debt restructuring agreements provided for under Article 61 of the Italian Insolvency Code and standstill agreements
provided under Article 62 of the Italian Insolvency Code may impose on the non-adhering creditors, inter alia, performance of
new obligations, the granting of new overdraft facilities, the maintenance of the possibility to utilize the existing facilities or
the drawing of new facilities.

Furthermore, Article 60 of the Italian Insolvency Code provides for the so called facilitated debt restructuring agreement
(accordi di ristrutturazione agevolati). Such proceeding, is a particular kind of debt restructuring agreement which may be
entered into with creditors representing as little as 30% of the total indebtedness (instead of the 60% generally required under
Article 57, paragraph 1, of the Italian Insolvency Code) provided that the debtor: (i) has waived the standstill on the payment
of non-consenting creditors (otherwise allowed by operation of law, for a period of 120 days from the court approval of the
agreement or from the maturity date of the relevant obligations, in “ordinary” debt restructuring agreements); and (ii) has not
previously requested to the court the granting of protective measures on its assets.

By virtue of Article 59 of the Italian Insolvency Code, Article 1239 of the Italian Civil Code applies to the creditors that have
adhered to the debt restructuring agreements. Non-participating creditors maintain their claims towards (i) those who are jointly
and severally liable with the debtor, (ii) the debtor’s guarantors and (iii) debtors by way of right of recourse (regresso). Unless
agreed otherwise, debt restructuring agreements produce effect towards the shareholders who are jointly liable with non-limited
liability companies, provided that, if such shareholders have granted guarantees, they will remain liable as guarantors.

The provision of Article 99 of the Italian Insolvency Code applies to both debt restructuring agreements and to court-supervised
compositions with creditors (concordato preventivo) outlined below.

**_Court supervised composition with creditors (concordato preventivo)_**

A company which is insolvent or in a situation of crisis (as defined above) and that has not been declared insolvent by the court
has the option to make a composition proposal to its creditors, under court supervision, in order to compose its overall
indebtedness and/or reorganize its business, thereby avoiding a declaration of insolvency and the initiation of insolvency
proceedings (so called “concordato preventivo”). Such composition proposal can be made by a commercial enterprise which
exceeds any of the following thresholds: (i) has had assets (attivo patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million
for each of the three preceding fiscal years, (ii) gross revenue (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for
each of the three preceding fiscal years, and (iii) has total indebtedness in excess (included debts not yet due) of €0.5 million.
Only the debtor can file a petition with the court for a concordato preventivo with the court based in the location of the debtor’s
main office. The debtor must file the petition together with, among others, a restructuring plan containing an analytic description
of manner and timing of the fulfillment of the proposal and an independent expert report assessing the feasibility of the
composition proposal and the truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by the company. The petition for
_concordato preventivo is then published by the debtor in the company’s register by the registry of the court and communicated_
to the public prosecutor. From the date of such publication to the date on which the court sanctions the concordato preventivo,
preexisting creditors cannot obtain security interests (unless authorized by the court) and mortgages registered within the 90
days preceding the date on which the petition for the _concordato preventivo is published in the company’s register are_
ineffective against such pre-existing creditors. According to Article 54, paragraph 2, of the Italian Insolvency Code, provided
that the petition for the admission to the concordato proceedings includes the relevant request, from the date of publication of
the petition in the companies’ registry, it is prohibited to commence or continue the enforcement and the conservative actions
(or, in any event, to take any initiatives prohibited under the relevant measures). As already described with reference to debt
restructuring agreements, the measures can also be requested pursuant to Article 44 of the Italian Insolvency Code, together
with a pre-petition for the access to one of the restructuring tools provided for by the Italian Insolvency Code.


-----

The composition proposal filed in connection with the petition may provide for: (i) the restructuring and payment of debts and
the satisfaction of creditors’ claims (provided that, in any case, it will ensure payment of the unsecured receivables in a
percentage of at least 20%, except for the case of composition with creditors with continuity of the going concern (concordato
_con continuità aziendale)), including through extraordinary transactions, such as the granting to creditors and to their_
subsidiaries or affiliated companies of shares, bonds (including bonds convertible into shares), or other financial instruments
and debt securities; (ii) the transfer to a receiver (assuntore) of the operations of the debtor company making the composition
proposal; (iii) the division of creditors into classes (which is mandatory in certain cases provided under the Article 85 of the
Italian Insolvency Code), provided that each class is composed of creditors having homogeneous legal positions and economic
interests; and (iv) different treatment of creditors belonging to different classes. The composition proposal may also contain a
proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes. Save for the provisions provided for under Article
109 of the Italian Insolvency Code, Article 86 of the Italian Insolvency Code has provided that, in the context of a composition
with creditors on a going concern basis (concordato con continuità), the plan may provide for a standstill for the secured
creditors, which may extend up to six months from the date of sanctioning (omologa) of the composition with creditors proposal
for the payment of secured creditors (creditori privilegiati) pursuant to Article 2751-bis, no. 1, of the Italian Civil Code (i.e.
employees).

Pursuant to Article 84, paragraph 4, the Italian Insolvency Code, in order to strengthen the position of the unsecured creditors,
a composition with creditors proposal with liquidation purpose (concordato liquidatorio) (i.e., a composition with creditors
proposal aiming at having all the assets sold in the creditors’ interest by the judicial commissioner) must ensure that (i) external
resources are contributed which increase the assets available at the time of the filing of the petition by at least 10% and (ii) the
degraded secured creditors as well as unsecured creditors are paid in a percentage equal to 20% of their total claims. In this
respect, it should be noted that resources contributed for the purpose of a composition with creditors proposal with liquidation
purpose (concordato liquidatorio) may be distributed notwithstanding the provisions set forth under Articles 2740 and 2741 of
the Italian Civil Code provided that such distribution complies with the 20% requirement set forth above. Resources contributed
are considered as “external” when provided for any reason by the debtor’s shareholders with no obligation of repayment or
subordination, in relation to which the plan provides them to be for the sole benefit of the creditors. This provision does not
apply to composition with creditors proposals based on the continuation of the going concern (concordato con continuità
_aziendale)._

Under the composition with creditors, there is no dispossession of the debtor who accordingly retains management powers
under the supervision of a court-appointed official (commissario giudiziale) and the delegated judge (giudice delegato). From
the date of the publication of the petition to the date on which the court sanctions the _concordato preventivo, the debtor is_
entitled to operate in the ordinary course of its business, although extraordinary transactions require the prior written approval
of the court. Provided that the abovementioned measures are requested, during this time, all enforcement actions, precautionary
actions and interim measures sought by the creditors, whose title arose beforehand, are stayed. The accrual of interests is
suspended for the same timeframe, except for claims secured by pledges, liens or mortgages. Pre-existing creditors cannot
obtain security interests (unless authorized by the court) and mortgages registered within the 90 days preceding the date on
which the petition for the concordato preventivo is published in the companies’ register are ineffective against such pre-existing
creditors. Any act, payment or security executed or created after the filing of the _concordato preventivo application and in_
accordance with its rules and procedures is exempt from claw-back action. The debtor is also exempted from certain bankruptcy
crimes provided under Articles 322, third paragraph (“preferential bankruptcy”), and 323 (“simple bankruptcy”) of the Italian
Insolvency Code, in relation to acts and payments made in execution of the composition with creditors and/or in relation to
finance provided under Article 99 of the Italian Insolvency Code upon judicial authorization. Claims arising from acts lawfully
carried out by the distressed company have super senior priority (prededucibilità) in the event of a subsequent judicial
liquidation (see Statutory priorities below).

For details regarding super senior financing, please refer to the following paragraph (Available financing forms under the
_Italian Insolvency Code)._

The filing of the petition for the concordato preventivo may be preceded by the filing of a preliminary and simplified petition
pursuant to Article 44 of the Italian Insolvency Code. For sake of clarity, under Italian Insolvency Code, the simplified petition
may be utilised by the debtor also to access a debt restructuring agreement or a restructuring plan subject to approval by the
court (piano di ristrutturazione soggetto ad omologazione) or a _concordato. The debtor company may file such petition,_
reserving the right to submit the underlying plan, the proposal and all relevant documentation (or the debt restructuring
agreement, or the restructuring plan) within a period assigned by the court (a) between 30 and 60 days from the date of the
filing of the preliminary petition, subject to only one possible further extension of up to 60 days, where there are reasonable
grounds for such extension (giustificati motivi) and where filings for a judicial liquidation proceeding are not pending. If the
court accepts such preliminary petition, it may, among other things: (i) appoint a judicial commissioner (commissario
_giudiziale) to overview the company, who, in the event that the debtor has carried out one of the activities under Article 106 of_


-----

the Italian Insolvency Code (e.g., concealment of part of assets, omission to report one or more claims, declaration of
nonexistent liabilities or commission of other fraudulent acts), will report it to the court, which, upon further verification, may
reject the petition at court for a concordato preventivo; and (ii) set forth reporting and information duties of the company during
the abovementioned period. As mentioned above, filing the simplified petition, the debtor may request the application of the
measures preventing the commencement or continuation of enforcement and conservative actions.

Pursuant to Article 44, paragraph 1, letter c) of the Italian Insolvency Code, the decree setting the term for the presentation of
the documentation contains also the periodical information requirements (also relating to the financial management of the
company and to the activities carried out for the purposes of the filing of the application and the restructuring plan) that the
company has to fulfill, at least on a monthly basis, until the lapse of the term established by the court. The debtor company will
file, on a monthly basis, the company’s financial position, which is published, the following day, in the company’s register.

Noncompliance with these requirements results in the simplified petition being declared inadmissible and, upon request of the
creditors or the public prosecutor and provided that the relevant requirements are verified, in the adjudication of the distressed
company into judicial liquidation. If the activities carried out by the debtor company appear to be clearly inappropriate to the
preparation of the “full” application, the court may, ex officio, after hearing the debtor and – if appointed – the judicial
commissioner, reduce the time for the filing of additional documents. Following the filing of the simplified petition and until
the decree of admission to the composition with creditors, the distressed company may: (i) carry out acts pertaining to its
ordinary activity; and (ii) seek the court’s authorization to carry out acts pertaining to its non-recurring activity, to the extent
they are urgent. Claims arising from acts lawfully carried out by the distressed company after the filing of the _concordato_
_preventivo petition (including preliminary petition) have super priority (prededucibilità) in case of a subsequent judicial_
liquidation.

The concordato preventivo proposal may also provide, inter alia: (i) the continuation of the business by the debtor as going
concern (concordato con continuità aziendale diretta); or (ii) the transfer of the business to one or more companies (concordato
_con continuità aziendale indiretta) as well as for a particular composition with creditors proceeding through which any assets_
that are no longer necessary to run the business of the company are liquidated (concordato misto). According to Article 84,
paragraph 3 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the concordato misto qualifies as a concordato con continuità aziendale, regardless
of the “portion” of business for which going concern is envisaged. In case of concordato con continuità aziendale diretta, the
plan and the petition for the concordato preventivo must fully describe the costs and revenue that are expected as a consequence
of the continuation of the business as a going concern, as well as the financial resources and support which will be necessary.
The report of the independent expert must also certify that the continuation of the business is conducive to the satisfaction of
creditors’ claimsto an extent not lower than what they would receive in a judicial liquidation. Existing contracts, even if entered
with governmental bodies, are automatically not to be terminated by admission to procedure.

Furthermore, the going concern-based arrangements with creditors can provide for, among others, the winding up of those
assets that are not functional to the business allowed. The composition agreement may also contain a proposed tax settlement
for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes.

Under Article 100 of the Italian Insolvency Code, a debtor who files for a _concordato pursuant to Articles 44 and 87 of the_
Italian Insolvency Code based on business continuity may request the court to be authorized to:

(i) repay pre-filing claims relating to the purchase of goods or services if an independent expert certifies that
they are essential for business continuity and to ensure the best satisfaction of creditors; the court may
authorize payment of the remuneration due, for the months preceding the filing of the application for the
composition with creditors, to the workers employed in the business whose continuation is envisaged under
the plan;

(ii) repay, in accordance with the relevant contractual terms, the installments due under a loan agreement which
is secured by way of a security interest over the assets used in the business, provided that: (a) at the date of
the filing of the application for admission to the composition with creditors, the debtor has fulfilled its
obligations or the court authorizes the payment of the debt for principal and interest due at that date; and (b)
the independent expert certifies (i) that such payments are essential for the continuation of the business
activity and functional to ensuring the best satisfaction of the creditors and, (ii) that the secured claims can
be fully satisfied with the proceeds of the liquidation of the asset carried out at market value and that the
repayment of the installments due does not prejudice the rights of the other creditors.

If the court determines that the composition proposal is admissible, it appoints a judge (giudice delegato) to supervise the
procedure, appoints one or more judicial officers (commissari giudiziali) and schedules a specific period of time during which
creditors can express their vote. During the implementation of the proposal, the company generally continues to be managed


-----

by its corporate bodies (usually its board of directors), but is supervised by the appointed judicial officers and judge (who will
authorize all transactions that exceed the ordinary course of business).

Article 91 of the Italian Insolvency Code provides that, if the composition with creditors’ plan includes an offer for the sale of
the debtor’s assets or the sale of a going concern of the debtor to an identified third party, the court or the delegated judge shall
order that appropriate publicity is given to the offer in order to acquire competing offers (offerte concorrenti). If expressions
of interest are received, the court or the delegated judge, by decree, shall order the opening of the competitive proceeding.
Furthermore pursuant to Article 91, paragraph 4, the judicial decree referred above establishes the procedures for the submission
of irrevocable offers, providing that in all cases, among others, the following is ensured: (a) their comparability, (b) the
requirements for the participation of the bidders, (c) the forms and timing of access to relevant information, (d) any limits on
the use of such information, (e) the manner in which the judicial commissioner must provide information to those who request
it, (f) the manner in which the competitive procedure is to be conducted, (g) the minimum increase in the consideration to be
provided by the subsequent offers, (h) the guarantees to be given by the bidders, (i) the forms of publicity, and (l) the date of
the hearing for the evaluation of the bids if the sale takes place before the court. With the sale or with the assignment, whichever
is earlier, to a person other than the original bidder identified in the plan, the latter and the debtor are released from their
obligations towards each other and accordingly the debtor shall amend the proposal and plan in accordance with the outcome
of the competitive proceeding.

The composition with creditors with liquidation purposes (concordato preventivo liquidatorio) is voted on within the period of
time scheduled by the court and must be approved with the favorable vote of the creditors representing the majority of the
receivables admitted to vote and, in the event that the proposal provides for more classes of creditors, the majority of the
receivables admitted to vote shall be reached the majority of the classes. Pursuant to Article 109, paragraph 1, of the Italian
Insolvency Code, in case one creditor holds more than the majority of receivables admitted to voting, it is also necessary to
reach majority by headcount. The concordato preventivo is approved only if the required majorities of creditors expressly voted
in favor of the proposal. Secured creditors are not entitled to vote on the proposal of concordato preventivo unless and to the
extent they waive their security, or the concordato preventivo provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of the fair
market value of their secured assets (such value being assessed by an independent expert), in which case they can vote only in
respect of the part of their debt affected by the proposal.

The court may approve the concordato preventivo (notwithstanding the circumstance that one or more classes objected to it)
if: (i) the majority of classes has approved it; and (ii) the court deems that the interests of the non-adhering creditors would be
adequately safeguarded through it compared to other solutions (in particular in comparison with the judicial liquidation). If an
objection to the implementation of the concordato preventivo is filed by 20% of the creditors or, in case there are different
classes of creditors, by a creditor belonging to a non-adhering class, entitled to vote, the court may nevertheless sanction the
_concordato preventivo_ if it deems that the relevant creditors’ claims are likely to be satisfied to a greater extent as a result
of the concordato preventivo than would otherwise be the case (including the judicial winding-up).

Furthermore, pursuant to Article 90 of the Italian Insolvency Code provides for the possibility for creditors (except for
individuals or entities controlled, controlling or under common control of the debtor) holding at least 10% of the aggregate
claims against a debtor to present an alternative plan (proposta concorrente) to the debtor’s plan - within 30 days prior from
the related creditors’ vote on the debtor’s plan - in a court supervised composition with creditors proceedings (concordato
_preventivo) subject to certain conditions being met, including, in particular, that the proposal of the debtor does not ensure_
recovery of at least 30% of the unsecured claims (crediti chirografari), considering also that such percentage is reduced to 20%
in case the debtor has filed for a composizione negoziata provided for pursuant to Article 13 of the Italian Insolvency Code.

Differently from the general rules set out above, pursuant to Article 109 paragraph 5 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the
composition with creditors on a going-concern basis (concordato con continuità), is approved if all the creditors’ classes vote
in favor of such composition with creditors arrangement. In each class, the relevant composition with creditors’ proposal is
approved if the majority of the claims allowed to vote is reached or, failing that, if two-thirds of the claims of the voting
creditors have voted favorably, provided that the creditors holding at least half of the total claims of the same class have voted.
In case of non-approval, Article 112, paragraph 2, of the Italian Insolvency Code shall apply. In this respect, it should be noted
that secured creditors shall not vote if their claims are satisfied in cash, in full, within 180 days from the sanctioning (omologa)
of the concordato con continuità and provided that the security interests supporting the related claims remains firm until the
winding-up, functional to their satisfaction. In case of claims of employees or other claims secured under Article 2751-bis of
the Italian Civil Code, the delay is reduced to 30 days from the approval by the court.

Pursuant to Article 112, paragraph 5 of the Italian Insolvency Code, after the approval of the composition with creditors with
liquidation purposes (concordato preventivo liquidatorio) or of the composition with creditors which provides for assignment
of the assets to a receiver, non-adhering creditors (or creditors belonging to a non-adhering class) representing 20% or more of


-----

the liabilities may file an opposition (opposizione), challenging the economic convenience of the plan. In such case, the court
has the authority to “cram-down” non-adhering creditors, compelling their acceptance of the plan, if it deems that the proposed
treatment of their claims is equivalent to what they would recover in a judicial liquidation scenario. After the creditors’
approval, the court approves the composition with creditors and appoints one or more liquidators in order to execute the
approved plan if it has to be realized by way of a transfer of assets. The court may grant special powers to the judicial
commissioner to implement the plan if the debtor does not cooperate, including by taking all corporate actions required.

In the composition with creditors on a going-concern basis (concordato con continuità), if a dissenting creditor opposes the
proposal, the court may nevertheless sanction the concordato preventivo if it deems that the relevant creditor’s claim will likely
be satisfied to an extent not lower than what would be the case in a judicial liquidation.

Creditors who did not exercise their voting right will be deemed not to approve the concordato preventivo proposal. In relation
to voting by the holder of the Notes in the concordato proceedings, the interactions between (i) the provisions set forth under
the Indenture with respect to meetings of holders of the Notes, the applicable majorities and the rights of each holder of the
Notes to vote in the relevant meeting and (ii) applicable Italian law provisions relating to quorum and majorities in meetings
of holders of notes issued by Italian companies are largely untested in the Italian courts (recent case law has however affirmed
the right of noteholders whose vote may be tainted by conflict of interest as could be the case of disenfranchised noteholders
to be computed for the purposes of relevant quora and be admitted to vote, albeit in a specific class).

Among others, (i) the companies controlling the debtor, controlled by the debtor and those under the control of the entity
controlling the debtor, (ii) the assignees of the claims of the entities under point (i), if the assignment has been perfected during
the year preceding the concordato and (iii) creditors in conflict of interest are excluded from voting.

The court approves the concordato preventivo even in the absence of a vote by the tax authority or by the social contribution
entities (enti gestori di forme di previdenza o assistenza obbligatorie) when their positive vote is decisive for the purposes of
achieving the majorities referred to in Article 109, paragraph 1 of the Italian Insolvency Code, also on the basis of the result of
the report of the independent expert referred to in Article 88 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the proposal to satisfy the aforesaid
authorities and entities is convenient compared to a judicial liquidation scenario.

Pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Insolvency Code, if the creditors do not approve the concordato preventivo, the delegated
judge (giudice delegato) shall promptly inform the court which, having decided that the appropriate conditions apply, shall
declare the opening of the judicial liquidation proceeding.

The terms and the performance of the outstanding contracts which have been entered into, from time to time, by the debtor are
not automatically affected by the _concordato preventivo proceeding and normally continue pending the procedure, any_
agreement to the contrary being ineffective. However, pursuant to Article 97 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the debtor may
request the competent court to be authorized to terminate pending agreements (contratti ancora ineseguiti o non compiutamente
_eseguiti) if the continuation of such agreements is inconsistent with the prospects and the execution of the composition with_
creditors’ plan, except for certain agreements which are excluded from the scope of the above provision (e.g., employment
agreements (rapporti di lavoro subordinato), residential real estate preliminary sale agreements (contratti preliminari di
_vendita aventi ad oggetto immobili ad uso abitativo) and real estate lease agreements (contratti di locazione di immobili)). The_
request may be filed with the competent court at the time of the filing of the application for the concordato preventivo or to the
judge (giudice delegato), if the application is made after admission to the procedure. Upon the debtor’s request, the pending
agreements can also be suspended for a period of time not longer than the term granted by the court upon the filing of the
preliminary petition. When the composition proposal together with the relevant plan have been submitted, the suspension may
also be authorized by the court for a further duration, which, however, may not exceed thirty days from the date of the decree
opening the procedure, which may not be further extended. In such circumstances, the other party has the right to receive an
indemnification equivalent to the damages suffered for the non-fulfillment of the agreement. Such indemnification would be
paid as a debt pre-existing to the filing of the petition for admission to the concordato preventivo procedure.

Pursuant to Articles 119 and 120 of the Italian Insolvency Code, in the event of a breach of the composition with creditors plan
or fraud, provided that the relevant requirements are met, the concordato can be terminated or annulled, as the case may be,
upon petition of one or more of the creditors and the judicial liquidation may follow, at the behest of the relevant court. If the
composition with creditors is implemented, terms and conditions of payments are amended as per the concordato proposal, and
the debtor may return to its usual operations (if the assets of the company are still in his possession). Concordato preventivo is
compulsory for all creditors prior to the publication of the application in the companies’ register. However, creditors retain
without prejudice their rights against co-debtors and guarantors of the debtor.

In case of non-minor breaches, the concordato may be terminated by each of the creditors or the judicial commissioner (upon
request by one or more of the creditors). The relevant petition must be brought within one year from the deadline originally


-----

scheduled for the last activity to be carried out under the concordato itself. The concordato may also be annulled upon request
of the judicial commissioner or of one or more creditors in case a portion of the assets of the debtor has been concealed or the
liabilities have been willfully exaggerated. The relevant petition must be brought within six months from the discovery of the
concealment/exaggeration and, in any event, within two years from the deadline originally scheduled for the last activity to be
carried out under the concordato itself.

**_Available financing forms under the Italian Insolvency Code_**

The enactment of the Italian Insolvency Code did not change the main features of the previous legal framework set out in the
Italian Bankruptcy Law. The aim at preserving the value of the company as a going concern and maximizing creditor’s
repayment are the main goals both of the previous legal framework and the Italian Insolvency Code. However, the new
provisions under the Italian Insolvency Code remove some uncertainties and clarifies some debated issues.

In addition, the provisions under the Italian Bankruptcy Law focused mainly on the perspective of creditors already having
claims against the company to avoid that the expectations of recovery of such claims were reduced due to the potential
considerable increase in predeductible claims and, to this extent, granted a preeminent role to the independent expert together
with the court authorization procedures. Unlike the former legal framework, the new provisions of the Italian Insolvency Code
focus more on preserving the business value of the distressed company as a going concern by strengthening the key role of the
financing of the debtor in the context of the relevant proceedings.

The provision of Article 99 of the Italian Insolvency Code applies to both debt restructuring agreement and to the courtsupervised compositions with creditors (concordato preventivo).

The main features of the provisions concerning different available financings under the Italian Insolvency Code are set out
below.

_Interim financing - Article 99 Paragraph 1 to 4 Italian Insolvency Code_

Pursuant to Article 99, paragraphs 1 and 2, of the Italian Insolvency Code, in the context of restructuring transactions on a
going concern basis, also in cases in which business continuity is maintained exclusively in a view of liquidation, the Court,
after the filing of a petition pursuant to Articles 40 or 44 of the Italian Insolvency Code and pending the sanctioning
(omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 57 (or Article 60 or 61) of the Italian Insolvency Code
or a petition pursuant to Article 87 of the Italian Insolvency Code (in relation to the court-supervised composition with creditors
procedure described above) may authorize the debtor, if so expressly requested to incur in new super senior indebtedness and
to secure such indebtedness, subject to the court’s authorization with in rem security (garanzie reali), or by assigning claims,
provided that: (i) the petition specifies (A) the purpose of the financing; (B) that the debtor is unable to otherwise obtain the
required funds and (C) that the absence of such financing will entail an imminent and irreparable prejudice to the going concern
or to the proceedings; and (ii) the expert appointed by the debtor, having verified the overall financial needs of the company
until the sanctioning (omologazione), declares that the new financing are functional to the continuity of the business activities
until the sanctioning (omologa) of the relevant insolvency proceedings or to the opening of the proceedings or to conduct them
and, in any case, are aimed at providing a better satisfaction of the rights of the creditors. The expert report is not necessary in
case the court recognizes that there is the urgent need to avoid an imminent and irreparable prejudice to the going concern. In
the event of the subsequent admission of the debtor to the judicial liquidation proceeding (liquidazione giudiziale), the
aforementioned financings do not enjoy the super senior priority status (prededucibilità) in case the petition or the expert report
contain false data or omit important information or in case the debtor performed acts in fraud of the creditors (atti in frode ai
_creditori) and the judicial receiver proves that who made available such financings to the debtor, had knowledge of such_
circumstances at the date of the disbursement.

_Bridge Financings - Article 99 Paragraph 5 Italian Insolvency Code_

Pursuant to Article 99, paragraph 5, of the Italian Insolvency Code, financings (together with the related claims) granted, in
any form, in view of (i.e., before) presentation of a petition for the sanctioning (omologazione) of a debt restructuring agreement
or a court-supervised composition with creditors (concordato preventivo) (finanza ponte), may be granted such priority status
provided that (i) they meet the requirements of Article 99, paragraphs 1 and 2 (described above), and (ii) such financings are
envisaged by the relevant plan or agreement and the priority status is expressly provided for by the court at the time of opening
of the concordato preventivo or sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement. The indebtedness under such
financing option may be secured, subject to the court’s authorization, with in rem security (garanzie reali), or by assigning
claims.


-----

_Implementation financing - Article 101 Italian Insolvency Code_

In restructuring transactions on a going concern basis, pursuant to Article 101 of the Italian Insolvency Code, any financing
granted to the debtor pursuant to a debt restructuring agreement (or a court-supervised pre-judicial liquidation composition
with creditors) sanctioned by the competent court and expressly provided for in the relevant plan, enjoy super senior priority
status (prededucibilità) in case of subsequent judicial liquidation, save for the below (such status also applies to financing
granted by shareholders, but only up to 80% of such financing, unless the lender has become a shareholder of the debtor as
implementation of the debt restructuring agreement or of the composition with creditors, as in such case the priority status is
afforded to 100% of the financing) according with the provisions set forth in Article 221 of Italian Insolvency Code. In the
event of the subsequent admission of the debtor to the judicial liquidation proceeding (liquidazione giudiziale), the
aforementioned financings do not enjoy the super senior priority status (prededucibilità) in case the composition plan or the
debt restructuring agreement, on the basis of an assessment to be made at the time of the relevant filing, results to be based
upon false data or omission of relevant information or in case the debtor performed acts in fraud of the creditors (atti in frode
_ai creditori) and the judicial receiver proves that who made available such financings to the debtor, had knowledge of such_
circumstances at the date of the disbursement.

_The shareholders’ financing – Art. 102 Italian Insolvency Code_

Pursuant to Art. 102, Paragraph 1 of the Italian Insolvency Code super senior ranking status also applies to any financings made
available by shareholders in any form (including any guarantee facility or granting counter-indemnities) up to 80% of their
amount.

Paragraph 2 of Article 102 of the Italian Insolvency Code clarifies that, to the extent the financing is made available by an
entity becoming a shareholder in the context of and by way of implementation of a composition with creditors or debt
restructuring agreement, all the claims deriving from such financings benefit of super senior ranking status and the 80%
threshold limitation set out in Paragraph 1 does not apply.

_Super senior ranking - Art. 99 Paragraph 6 and 101 Paragraph 2 Corporate Crisis and Insolvency Code_

Super senior ranking (prededucibilità) of the claims is the most relevant feature of bridge financings, interim financings and
implementation financings as described in the paragraphs above.

Pursuant to Article 6(1) of the Italian Insolvency Code, the claims deriving from such financings are expressly qualified as
super senior by law and by Article 6(2) of the Italian Insolvency Code which clarifies that their super senior ranking natures
continues in the context of any subsequent insolvency or enforcement proceedings (including in a judicial liquidation or any
so-called minor proceedings).

As already explained above, super senior ranking nature of such financings will be excluded in case of acts of fraud (which
may be relevant also in the context of debt restructuring agreements).

Such limit to super senior ranking is regulated differently for interim financings and bridge financings on the one side and for
the implementation financings on the other side.

More specifically, for interim financings or bridge financings false data or omission of relevant information are relevant when
found by the court in the request for the incurrence of the financings or the attestation of the independent expert, whilst for
implementation financings such elements are relevant when included in plan underlying the composition with creditors or the
debt restructuring agreement.

With reference to interim financings and bridge financings, Article 99 Paragraph 6 of the Italian Insolvency Code provides
that, in case of the opening of a judicial liquidation, such financings (although authorized by the court in the context of the
composition with creditors or the debt restructuring agreement) do not benefit from super senior ranking when it is proved
(jointly) that:

(i) the request or the independent expert report contains false data or omits relevant information, or when the
debtor has committed acts to defraud creditors in order to obtain the authorization; and

(ii) the receiver proves that the entities who provided the financing, at the date of issuance, knew the
aforementioned circumstances.


-----

With reference to implementation financings, the relevant provisions are set out in Article 101 Paragraph 2 of the Italian
Insolvency Code providing that such financings do not benefit from the super senior ranking, in case of the opening of a judicial
liquidation (alternatively):

(i) when, based on an assessment to be made at the time of filing of the petition for the opening of the proceeding,
the plan underlying the composition with creditors or debt restructuring agreement turns out to be based on
false data or on the omission of relevant information; or

(ii) when the debtor has carried out acts of fraud towards its creditors and the receiver proves that the lenders
providing the financings were aware of such circumstances at the time of the establishment of the financings.

**_Restructuring plan subject to sanctoning (piano di ristrutturazione soggetto ad omologazione)_**

An important novelty concerning the crisis regulation procedures governed by Title IV of Part I of the Italian Insolvency Code,
is the new figure of the restructuring plan subject to sanctioning (piano di ristrutturazione soggetto ad omologazione) (the socalled “PRO”, the rules of which are set out in the new Articles 64-bis and 64-ter of the Italian Insolvency Code).

This new tool, takes the form of a restructuring framework that may disregard the distribution rules of regular insolvency
proceedings but can be enacted provided that strict requirements are met. In this regard, it should be noted that recourse to this
instrument will be reserved for a debtor in crisis or insolvent that plans to satisfy its creditors by dividing them into classes
according to homogeneous legal positions and economic interests. This instrument allows the plan’s proceeds to be distributed
even in derogation of the principle of “par condicio creditorum” (i.e. the equal treatment of creditors), provided that the
proposal is approved by unanimous consent of the classes. A judgement of admissibility is provided for by the court, which is
called upon to assess the proposal’s timeliness and to verify the correctness of the class formation criteria.

Application for the approval by the court of a restructuring plan must follow the steps of the common framework applicable to
all restructuring tools and frameworks (i.e. _concordato preventivo, debt restructuring agreement and also to judicial_
liquidation). The regulation of the restructuring plan subject to sanctioning (piano di ristrutturazione soggetto ad
_omologazione), from the date of submission of the application until its approval, is based on the model of the composizione_
_negoziata della crisi: the entrepreneur maintains the ordinary and extraordinary management of the company in the prevailing_
interest of the creditors under the supervision of the court-appointed judicial commissioner. The debtor is, in any case, allowed
to amend the application at any time, formulating a proposal of composition with creditors (concordato preventivo). In that
case, the time limit for approval is shortened. Similarly, the debtor that has filed an application for composition with creditors
may amend the application by applying for approval of the restructuring plan provided that the application is made before
voting commences. In each class, the proposal is approved if a majority of the claims allowed to vote is reached or, failing that,
if two-thirds of the claims of the voting creditors have voted in favor, provided that creditors holding at least half of the total
claims of the same class have voted. The court will approve the restructuring plan in the event of approval by all classes. If a
dissenting creditor objects to the proposal, the court will approve and homologate the restructuring plan if the proposal satisfies
the claim to a not lesser extent than the one resulting from a judicial liquidation. A creditor that has not objected to the lack of
convenience in its observations may not file an objection referred before, unless it proves such the lack of objection was due
to a cause not attributable to it. In summary the restructuring plan subject to sanctioning (piano di ristrutturazione soggetto ad
_omologazione) thus represents for the debtor an opportunity instrument which minimizes the admissibility phase, providing_
greater freedom of action, but requiring the approval of all classes of creditors in order to be effectively approved.

Against the judgment of the court ruling on the approval of the restructuring plan subject to sanctioning (piano di
_ristrutturazione soggetto ad omologazione), the parties may file an appeal to the competent court of appeal within the term of_
30 days from the notification of the relevant judgement of the court.

**_Court-supervised composition for small debtors_**

The Italian Insolvency Code provides for a simplified court-supervised composition in case the debtor does not meet the
dimensional requirements to access other restructuring tools.

Procedural steps and effects do essentially mimic those of the concordato preventivo, but it entails the involvement of the board
for crisis settlement (organismo di composizione della crisi), which assists the debtor in preparing the paperwork and filing the
petition, and performs the activities and duties which, in a concordato preventivo are prerogatives of the judicial commissioner.


-----

**_Judicial liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale)_**

The judicial liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale) is a court-supervised procedure for the liquidation of an insolvent company’s
assets and for the distribution of the related proceeds. It results in the company’s liquidation. Insolvency, as defined under
Article 2 of the Italian Insolvency Code, also evidenced by defaults and/or external elements, occurs when a debtor is no longer
able to regularly meet its obligations as they come due.

The judicial liquidation is declared by the competent court and is applicable only to commercial enterprises (imprenditori
_commerciali) if any of the following thresholds are met: the company (i) has had assets (attivo patrimoniale) in an aggregate_
amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years; (ii) has had gross revenue (ricavi lordi) in an
aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years; and (iii) has total indebtedness
(including debts not yet due) in excess of €0.5 million. Pursuant to Article 37 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the request to
commence the judicial liquidation of the debtor company’s assets can be filed by (i) the debtor company itself, (ii) the
administrative bodies and authorities that have control and supervisory functions over the company, (iii) by one or more of
the debtor’s creditors and (iv) in certain cases, by the public prosecutor.

Upon the commencement of judicial liquidation proceedings, amongst other things:

(i) subject to certain exceptions, all actions of creditors are stayed and creditors must file claims within a defined period. In
particular, under certain circumstances, secured creditors may enforce against the secured property as soon as their claims
are admitted as secured claims. Secured claims are paid out of the proceeds of the secured assets, together with interest
and expenses. Any outstanding balance will be considered unsecured and rank pari passu with all of the debtor’s other
unsecured debt. The secured creditor may sell the secured asset only after it has obtained authorization from the designated
judge (giudice delegato). After hearing the judicial receiver and the creditors’ committee, the designated judge decides
whether to authorize the sale, and sets forth the timing in its decision;

(ii) under certain circumstances secured creditors may execute against the secured property as soon as their claims are

admitted as preferred claims. Secured claims are paid out of the proceeds of liquidation of the secured assets, together
with the applicable interest and subject to any relevant expenses. In case the sale price is not high enough to
determine a full satisfaction of their credits, any outstanding balance will be considered unsecured and rank pari
_passu_ with all of the debtor’s other unsecured debt. Secured creditors may sell the secured asset only with the court
authorization. After hearing the judicial receiver (curatore) and the creditors’ committee, the court decides whether to
authorize the sale, and sets forth the relevant timing in his or her decision;

(iii) the payments of all debts and liabilities of the debtor and all the acts, transactions, payments made or received by the

insolvent debtor are immediately suspended and formalities with third parties that have been carried out after the
declaration of insolvency are not effective as regards the creditors of the debtor (Article 145 of Italian Insolvency Code);

(iv) the debtor is dispossessed, and the administration of the debtor and the management of its assets are transferred to the

judicial receiver (curatore). The debtor may no longer validly act in court as claimant or defendant in relation to the assets
(Article 142 of the Italian Insolvency Code). The judicial receiver is vested with such powers upon the authorization of
the delegated judge. However, all pending proceedings in which the debtor is involved are automatically stayed from the
date the adjudication is issued and need to be re-initiated by or against the judicial receiver;

(v) the beginning of the judicial liquidation involves the cessation of all the activities of the company with a view to a sale of

all assets. However, continuation of business may be authorized by the court if the continuation of the company’s business
does not cause damage to creditors. If the competent court authorizes the continuation of the business (esercizio
_provvisorio dell’impresa), the management of the business is entrusted to the judicial receiver (who may in turn avail_
himself of qualified third parties for this purpose);

(vi) certain payments made, security interests given or transactions entered into by the debtor in a certain period before the

filing of the petition for the debtor’s submission to a judicial liquidation procedure (varying from six months to two years)
of after such filing can be set aside and declared ineffective or clawed back if certain conditions are met;

(vii) any act (including payments, pledges, and issuance of guarantees) made by the debtor after the commencement of the

proceedings, other than those made through the receiver, become ineffective against creditors; and

(viii) the execution of certain contracts and/or transactions pending as of the date of the insolvency declaration are suspended

until the receiver decides whether to take them over. Although the general rule is that the judicial receiver is allowed to


-----

either continue or terminate contracts where some or all of the obligations have not been performed by both parties, certain
contracts are subject to specific rules expressly provided for the Italian Insolvency Code.

In order to overcome the uncertainty that may predictably arise, the contractual counterparty may file a written petition
requiring the Court to give the judicial receiver (curatore) a deadline of no more than 60 days; within such deadline, the
receiver must decide to enter into the agreement or withdraw from it. Upon expiration of the deadline without the judicial
receiver having replied to the counterparty’s request, the pending agreement is deemed terminated. Although the general rule
is that the judicial receiver is allowed to terminate contracts where some or all of the obligations have not been performed,
certain contracts are subject to specific rules expressly provided for by the Italian Insolvency Code.

Judicial liquidation proceedings, as per the former bankruptcy proceedings under Italian Bankruptcy Law, are carried out
and supervised by a court-appointed judicial receiver, a deputy judge (giudice delegato) and a creditors’ committee (comitato
_dei creditori). The judicial receiver is not a representative of the creditors, and is responsible for the liquidation of the assets_
of the debtor to the satisfaction of creditors. The proceeds from the liquidation are distributed in accordance with statutory
priority rights. The liquidation of a debtor can take a considerable amount of time, particularly in cases where the debtor’s
assets include real estate property.

Furthermore, the parties of a judicial liquidation proceeding as well as any interested party, may file an appeal (opposizione)
to the decree closing the judicial liquidation proceeding within 30 days after having been notified of the same.

**_Composition with creditors in judicial liquidation (concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale)._**

Pursuant to Article 240 of the Italian Insolvency Code, judicial liquidation proceedings can terminate prior to the actual judicial
liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale) of the debtor, through a proposal for a composition with creditors in judicial liquidation.
By way of preliminary note, such agreement occurring in the context of a judicial liquidation proceeding (i) replaced the former
proceeding defined as “concordato fallimentare”, a composition with creditors agreement occurring in the context of a
bankruptcy proceeding (fallimento) formerly provided for under Article 124, paragraph 1 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and
(ii) should be kept distinct from the _concordato preventivo, which is an independent insolvency proceeding. This particular_
composition with creditor agreement benefits in a certain way both the debtor as well as the creditors, in fact while the former
is released of the debts falling into the relevant plan and also regains free disposal of his assets, the creditors are satisfied faster
and to a greater extent than they would have been with the full completion of the judicial liquidation process pertaining to the
debtor’s assets.

The creditor, a third party or the debtor himself may formulate a proposal having as its object a “plan” to satisfy creditors,
including preferential creditors, in full or in part. In case the concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale is proposed by the debtor,
such proposal, inter alia, (i) shall be filed after 1 year from the opening of the judicial liquidation proceeding and (ii) shall
provide for the contribution by the debtor of resources that increase the value of the debtor’s assets by at least 10%.

Such proposal shall be submitted to the competent judge, shall then be approved by the creditors and finally by the court. In
case the court’s decree approving the concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale becomes final (definitivo), the court declares the
judicial liquidation to be closed and terminated, initiating the enactment phase of the concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale.
In the context of a concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale, the competent court supervises both the proposal and execution
phases while the judicial receiver (curatore), once the liquidation is closed, loses his management functions and retains only
supervisory duties over the fulfilment of the terms and the conditions of the arrangement obligations arising from or in
connection with the aforementioned concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale.

Pursuant to Article 240, paragraph 2 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the proposal may provide for:

(i) the division of creditors into classes, according to homogeneous legal position and economic interests.

Under the relevant provision, such division is not mandatory but discretionary, provided two criteria for the
class identification: (a) legal position, i.e., the nature of the claim, e.g., unsecured or preferential and (b) the
homogeneous economic interests. In this respect, the Italian Insolvency Code requires for the criteria and
rationale for the division into classes to be expressly stated in order to avoid the distorted use of class
formation, put in place for the sole purpose of obtaining the approval of the abovementioned proposal;

(ii) differential treatment between creditors belonging to different classes, indicating the reasons of such
differences;


-----

(iii) the restructuring of the financial indebtedness of the debtor as well as the satisfaction of claims in any form
possible, by way of example:

(A) by assignment of assets;

(B) by assumption (accollo);

(C) by means of other extraordinary transactions, including the assignment to creditors (as well as to
companies in which they have an interest), of shares, quotas or bonds, including those convertible
into shares or other financial instruments and debt securities.

It should be noted that a special feature of the concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale is the option to provide that secured
creditors may not be satisfied in full. However, it is necessary for the plan to provide for their satisfaction to a non-lesser extent
than that the one which can be realized, by reason of preferential placement, from the relevant proceeds in the event of a judicial
liquidation, having regard to the market value attributable to the assets or rights over which the cause of pre-emption exists.

The concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale proposal must be approved by the creditors’ committee and the creditors holding
the simple majority (by value) of claims (and, if classes are formed, by a majority (by value) of the claims in the majority of
the classes). However, in the event of dissent by more than one creditor’s class, a cram-down may occur, i.e. in case the court
decides to approve the _concordato - despite a creditor belonging to a dissenting class contests the appropriateness of the_
proposal - if it finds that the claims can be satisfied by the concordato to a non-lesser extent than the practicable alternatives.
Final court confirmation and sanctioning (omologazione) is also required.

Finally, once approved and sanctioned (omologato) by the court the concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale is mandatory:

(i) for all existing creditors prior to the opening of the judicial liquidation proceeding; and

(ii) for creditors who have not applied for the admission to the judicial liquidation estate, to whom the guarantees
or the security interests given in the concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale by third parties do not extend.

With the termination of the judicial liquidation - as a consequence of the sanctioning decree (decreto di omologa), which
pursuant to Article 247 of the Italian Insolvency Code may be challenged and appealed within 30 days from its notification the debtor returns “in bonis” and enjoys the renewed availability of its assets.

  - _Statutory priorities. The statutory priority assigned to creditors under the Italian Insolvency Code may be different_
from the priorities in the United States, the United Kingdom and certain other EU jurisdictions. The proceeds of
liquidation shall be allocated according to the following order: (i) for payments of “predeductible” claims (i.e., claims
originated in the insolvency proceeding, such as costs related to the procedure) as better identified in Article 6 of the
Italian Insolvency Code; (ii) for payment of claims which are privileged, such as claims of secured creditors; and (iii)
for the payment of unsecured creditors’ claims. Under Italian law, the highest priority claims (after the costs of the
proceedings are paid) are the claims of preferential creditors, including, inter alia, a claim whose priority is legally
acquired (i.e., repayment of rescue or interim financing) the claims of the Italian tax authorities and social security
administrators, and claims for employee wages. The remaining priorities of claims are, in order of priority, those
related to secured creditors (creditori privilegiati; a preference in payment in most circumstances, but not exclusively,
provided for by law), mortgages (creditori ipotecari), pledges (creditori prignoratizi) and, lastly, unsecured creditors
(crediti chirografari). Under Italian law, the proceeds from the sale of the debtor’s estate are distributed according to
legal rules of priority. Neither the debtor nor the court can deviate from these priority rules by proposing their own
priorities of claims or by subordinating one claim to another based on equitable subordination principles (as a
consequence it must be noted that priority of payments such as those commonly provided in intercreditor contractual
arrangements may not be enforceable against an Italian judicial liquidation estate to the extent they are inconsistent
with the priorities provided by law). The law creates a hierarchy of claims that must be adhered to when distributing
the proceeds derived from the sale of the entire debtor’s estate or part thereof, or from a single asset.

In particular, pursuant to Article 6 of the Italian Insolvency Code, in addition to claims expressly qualified as “prededucibili”
under Italian law, among others, the following claims are “prededucibili”:

(i) claims relating to expenses and fees for services rendered by the business crisis settlement body;

(ii) professional claims arising from or in connection with the filing for the approval of a restructuring plan
subject to sanctioning, the debt restructuring agreements and for the application for protective measures, to


-----

the extent of 75% of the assessed claim and provided that the abovementioned plan or agreements are
approved and homologated;

(iii) professional claims arising from or in connection with the filing of for a court supervised composition with
creditors procedure as well as the filing of the related proposal and the plan accompanying it, within the limits
of 75% of the ascertained claims and provided that the proceedings are opened pursuant to Article 47 of the
Italian Insolvency Code; and

(iv) claims legally arisen in connection with insolvency proceedings for the management of the debtor’s assets
and the continuation of the business of the company as well as arising from the professional services required
by the related bodies.

- _Avoidance powers in insolvency. A fundamental principle of the Italian Insolvency Code is the equal treatment of all_
creditors (“par condicio creditorum”), according to which, absent statutory priorities or security right, no creditor may
be paid a higher percentage of his claim than other creditors. A consequence of this principle is not only that the
payment of debts by the judicial receiver is strictly regulated, but also that all transactions effected by the debtor over
the previous year (or, in certain cases, over the previous six months) are scrutinized and potentially unwound as
preferential.

Similar to other jurisdictions, there are so-called “claw-back” or avoidance provisions under Italian law that may give rise,
inter alia, to the revocation of payments or to the granting of security interests made by the debtor within a certain timeframe prior to the filing of the petition that led to the declaration of insolvency or after such filing. The key avoidance
provisions include, but are not limited to, transactions made below market value, preferential transactions and transactions
made with a view to defraud creditors. Claw-back rules under Italian law are normally considered to be particularly
favorable to the receiver in judicial liquidation compared to the rules applicable in other jurisdictions.

In insolvency proceedings, depending on the circumstances, the Italian Insolvency Code provides for a claw-back period
of up to two years (six months in certain circumstances) and a two-year ineffectiveness period for certain other transactions.
In the context of extraordinary administration procedures (as described below), the claw-back period may last up to three
or five years in certain circumstances. The Italian Insolvency Code distinguishes between acts or transactions which are
ineffective by operation of law and acts or transactions which are voidable at the request of the judicial receiver/court
commissioner, as detailed below.

- _Acts ineffective by operation of law. Under (i) Article 163 of the Italian Insolvency Code, subject to certain limited_
exception, all transactions entered into for no consideration are ineffective vis-à-vis creditors if entered into by the
debtor after the filing to the relevant court followed by the opening of the judicial liquidation procedure or within the
two years preceding such filing. Any asset subject to a transaction which is ineffective pursuant to Article 163 of the
Italian Insolvency Code becomes part of the liquidation estate by operation of law upon registration (trascrizione) of
the court’s decision opening the insolvency proceeding, without needing to wait for the ineffectiveness of the
transaction to be sanctioned by a court. Any interested person may challenge the registration before the delegated
judge as a violation of law, and (ii) under Article 164 of the Italian Insolvency Code, (A) payments of receivables
falling due on the day of the judicial declaration of opening of the judicial liquidation or later, if they were executed
by the debtor after the filing of the application followed by the opening of the judicial liquidation proceeding or in the
prior two-year period; and (B) payments made by the debtor with respect to any intercompany loan after the filing of
the application followed by the opening of the judicial liquidation proceeding or in the prior one-year period, are
ineffective vis-à-vis creditors.

- _Acts that may be avoided at the request of the judicial receiver/court commissioner. The following acts and_
transactions, if done or made during the period specified below, may be clawed back (revocati) vis-à-vis the debtor as
provided for by Article 166 of the Italian Insolvency Code and be declared ineffective, unless the non-insolvent party
proves that it had no actual or constructive knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at the time the transaction was entered
into:

(i) onerous transactions carried out after the filing followed by the opening of the judicial liquidation
proceeding or in the previous year, where the value of the debt or the obligations undertaken by the
debtor exceeds 25% of the value of the consideration received by and/or promised to the debtor;


-----

(ii) payments of debts, due and payable, made by the debtor which were not paid in cash or by other
customary means of payment which were carried out after the filing followed by the opening of the
judicial liquidation proceeding or in the previous year;

(iii) pledges and mortgages granted by the debtor after the filing followed by the opening of the judicial
liquidation proceeding or in the year prior, in order to secure pre-existing debts which were not yet
due at the time the new security was granted; and

(iv) pledges and mortgages granted by the debtor after the filing followed by the opening of the judicial
liquidation proceeding or in the prior six months in order to secure pre-existing debts which had
already fallen due at the time the new security was granted.

Furthermore, payments of debts that are immediately due and payable and any onerous transactions and/or granting of priority
rights/security interests for debts simultaneously created (event those of third parties) may be clawed back (revocati) and
declared ineffective, if the judicial receiver proves that the other party knew of the debtor’s state of insolvency and if made by
the debtor after the filing of the petition followed by the opening of the judicial liquidation or during the prior six months.

The following transactions are exempt from claw-back actions:

(i) payments for goods or services made in the ordinary course of business according to market practice;

(ii) a remittance on a bank account; provided that it does permanently reduce the entity’s debt towards the bank;

(iii) the sale, including an agreement for sale registered pursuant to Article 2645-bis of the Italian Civil Code, in
force as the date of this Offering Memorandum, made for a fair value and concerning a residential property
that is intended as the main residence of the purchaser or the purchaser’s family (within three degrees of
kinship) or a non-residential property that is intended as the main seat of the enterprise of the purchaser;
provided that, as at the date of the insolvency declaration, the activity is actually exercised therein or the
investments for the commencement of such activity have been carried out therein;

(iv) transactions entered into, payments made or guarantees granted with respect to the debtor’s goods, provided
that they concern the implementation of a piano attestato di risanamento (see “Out-of-court reorganization
_plans (piani attestati di risanamento) pursuant to Articles 56 or 284 of the Italian Insolvency Code” above);_

(v) a transaction entered into, payment made or guarantee or security interests granted in execution of a court
supervised composition with creditors (concordato preventivo), of an homologated restructuring plan subject
to sanctioning provided for pursuant to Article 64-bis of the Italian Insolvency Code (piano di ristrutturazione
_di cui all’articolo 64-bis omologato) or of an homologated debt restructuring agreements with creditors_
_(accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti omologati) and/or transactions entered into, payments made and_
security interests legitimately granted by the debtor after the filing of the application for a _concordato_
_preventivo or of an accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti (see above);_

(vi) remuneration payments to the entity’s employees and consultants concerning work carried out by them; and

(vii) payments of a debt that is immediately due, payable and made on the due date, with respect to services
necessary for access to a pre-judicial liquidation restructuring framework (see below under “pre-judicial
liquidation restructuring frameworks (strumenti di regolazione della crisi e dell’insolvenza della società)”)
or to other insolvency procedures provided for pursuant to the Italian Insolvency Code.

Pursuant to Article 170 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the limitation period for initiating claw-back action proceedings is three
years from the opening of the judicial liquidation procedure or, if earlier, five years from the act or transaction to be clawed
back. In case judicial liquidation is commenced after the filing of a petition to be admitted to any insolvency proceedings,
according to Article 170, paragraph 2 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the suspect period is calculated backward from the date
in which such petition is filed. In addition, in certain cases, the judicial receiver can request that certain transactions of the
debtor be declared ineffective within the ordinary claw-back period of five years (revocatoria ordinaria) provided for by the
Italian Civil Code. In this respect, under Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code, a creditor may demand that transactions whereby
the entity disposed of its assets prejudicially to such creditor’s rights be declared ineffective with respect to such creditor,
provided that the debtor was aware of such prejudice (or, if the transaction was entered into prior to the date on which the claim
was originated, that such transaction was fraudulently entered into by the debtor for the purpose of prejudicing the creditors)
and that, in the case of a transaction entered into for consideration with a third person, the third person was aware of such


-----

prejudice (and, if the transaction was entered into prior to the date on which the claim was originated, such third person
participated in the fraudulent design). The burden of proof is entirely with the receiver.

The Italian Insolvency Code provides special regimes on preferences and avoidances of intra-group transactions. Under Article
290 of the Italian Insolvency Code the limitation period of initiating intra-group claw-back actions (referring to acts and
transactions entered into by companies belonging to the same group that jeopardize the creditors’ interest) is extended to five
years from the filing for judicial liquidation declaration.

Law 132/2015 also introduced new Article 2929-bis to the Italian Civil Code, providing for a “simplified” claw-back action
for the creditor with respect to certain types of transactions put in place by the debtor with the aim to subtract (registered) assets
from the attachment by its creditors. In particular, the creditor can now start enforcement proceedings over the relevant assets
without previously obtaining a Court decision clawing back/ nullifying the relevant (fraudulent) transaction, to the extent that
such transaction had been carried out without consideration (e.g., gratuitous transfers, or creation of shield instruments such as
trusts or the so called fondo patrimoniale or “family trust”). In case of gratuitous transfers, the enforcement action can also be
carried out by the creditor against the third-party purchaser. Finally, as noted above, the Insolvency Regulation contains
conflicts of law rules which replace the various national rules of private international law in relation to insolvency proceedings
within the European Union.

Adequate organizational, administrative and accounting corporate structures. One of the main novelties included in the Italian
Insolvency Code concerns the definition of the organizational, administrative and accounting structures of a company which
are deemed to be adequate under Article 2086 of the Italian Civil Code, required by the applicable regulations for the purpose
of timely detection of the state of crisis and the undertaking of suitable initiatives by the debtor. Article 3 of the Italian
Insolvency Code requires the entrepreneur to adopt an appropriate organizational structure in accordance with Article 2086 of
the Italian Civil Code, for the purpose of timely detection of the crisis of the company as well as the timely undertaking of
suitable initiatives to overcome the crisis and recover business continuity. However, neither the aforementioned Article 3, in
its current wording, nor Article 2086 of the Italian Civil Code, as amended by the Italian Insolvency Code, contains a precise
description of the parameters, conditions and characteristics that are deemed to be necessary/needed for the definition and
especially for the identification of “adequate structures”.

In this regard, Article 3 of the Italian Insolvency Code precisely enunciates, on the one hand, the purposes to which the measures
and structures must aim in order to be considered as adequate for the timely detection of the crisis and, on the other hand, the
relevant warning signs in relation to the same. In this respect, it is stipulated that, for the purpose of the timely detection of the
company’s state of crisis, the measures and structures deemed to be adequate should make it possible to:

(i) detect any imbalances of an equity or economic-financial nature, related to the specific characteristics of the
company as well as to the business activity carried out by the debtor;

(ii) verify the non-sustainability of debts and the absence of prospects for business continuity for the next twelve
months as well as the warning signs identified by Article 3, paragraph 4 of the Italian Insolvency Code; and

(iii) derive the information necessary to follow the detailed checklist and conduct the practical test for the
reasonable pursuit of the debtor’s financial recovery.

For the sake of completeness and as set out above, it should also be noted that Article 3, paragraph 4 of the Italian Insolvency
Code provides an exact indication of the warning signs, identified, inter alia, as follows:

(i) the existence of payroll debts overdue for at least 30 days equal to more than half of the total monthly payroll
amount;

(ii) the existence of receivables owed to suppliers that are at least 90 days past due in an amount greater than the
amount of receivables that are not past due;

(iii) the existence of exposures to banks and other financial intermediaries that have been past due for more than
60 days or have exceeded the limit of credit facilities obtained in any form for at least 60 days provided that
they represent in the aggregate at least 5% of the total exposures; and

(iv) the existence of one or more exposures to certain public institutions listed under Article 25-novies of the
Italian Insolvency Code.

**_Common rules for pre-judicial liquidation restructuring frameworks (strumenti di regolazione della crisi e dell’insolvenza_**
**_della società)_**

In order to facilitate access and filing of restructuring procedures by the Italian companies, Articles 120-bis and ff. of the Italian
Insolvency Code have been enacted, introducing a set of rules applicable to all pre-judicial liquidation restructuring tools
(strumenti di regolazione della crisi e dell’insolvenza ). Among other things, pursuant to Article 120-bis, paragraph 2 of the
Italian Insolvency Code and the purposes of a successful restructuring, the plan may provide for “any modification of the
_articles of association of the debtor company, including capital increases and reductions, including with limitation or exclusion_
_of the option right and other modifications that directly affect the shareholders’ participation rights, as well as for mergers,_
_demergers and transformations”. Shareholders, who may no longer have an interest in the company, are prevented from_
hindering the restructuring or even one of its stages. For this reason, pursuant to Article 120-bis, paragraphs 3 and 4 of the
Italian Insolvency Code, the shareholders, while retaining a right to information in relation to both the initiation and the progress
of the restructuring process, may not remove the directors without just cause, as is the case for the statutory auditors of joint
stock companies, also in light of the fact that under the provisions of the Italian Insolvency Code it is not considered as being
just cause for directors’ removal, the filing for access to the pre-judicial liquidation restructuring tools (strumenti di regolazione
_della crisi e dell’insolvenza) when the related legal conditions and requirements are met. However, pursuant to Article 120-_
_bis,_ paragraph 5, shareholders representing at least 10% of the filing company’s corporate capital may make a competing
proposal.

The plan may provide for the formation of one class of shareholders or several classes if there are shareholders to whom
different rights are granted by the by-laws, including as a result of the changes provided for in the plan. The formation of classes
is, however, mandatory if the plan provides for changes that directly affect the shareholders’ participation rights and, in any
case, for large companies and companies with widespread capital. In this context, special conditions for approval of the
arrangement are set out pursuant to Article 120-quater of the Italian Insolvency Code when and if the plan provides for
shareholder attributions. Specific rules are then provided to ensure that creditors’ interests are protected in all cases in which
the restructuring tool envisages shareholders to retain a participation in the company with a certain value.

Article 120-quinquies of the Italian Insolvency Code, regulates the execution phase of such measure. In order to avoid any
obstructive attitude of the shareholders towards the approval of the restructuring tool, this provision expressly excludes the
necessity for their approval and/or resolution on the implementation of such restructuring tool, by generally attributing the
relevant powers to the directors or more specifically to the competent court, in relation to any amendment to the debtor’s bylaws which - being specifically provided for by the plan - do not require any discretionary resolution. Finally, it is stipulated
that changes in the corporate structure resulting from the implementation of a pre-judicial liquidation restructuring tools
(strumenti di regolazione della crisi e dell’insolvenza) shall not be considered as and constitute cause for the termination or
amendment of any agreement entered into by the debtor with third parties.

Articles 284 and ff. of the Italian Insolvency Code contain specific rules regarding (i) the access of a group to one of the prejudicial liquidation restructuring tools (strumenti di regolazione della crisi e dell’insolvenza ) aiming at unifying – to the
extent possible – the relevant proceedings; (ii) liability lawsuits available to the receiver; and (iii) subordination of claims.

**_Hardening period/clawback and fraudulent transfer_**

In a judicial liquidation proceeding, the Italian Insolvency Code provides for a claw-back period of up to two years (six-months
in certain circumstances). In addition, in certain cases, the judicial receiver can request that certain transactions of the
debtor are declared ineffective within the Italian Civil Code ordinary claw-back period of five years (revocatoria ordinaria).

Under Italian law, in the event that the relevant guarantor and/or security provider enters into insolvency proceedings, the
security interests created under the documents entered into to secure the Collateral and any future security interests or
guarantees could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator or by other creditors of such guarantor
and/or security provider under the rules of avoidance or claw-back (revocatoria) provided for pursuant to the Italian Insolvency
Code and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or claw-back of transactions by the debtor made during a
certain legally specified suspect period. The avoidance may relate to (i) transactions made by the debtor within the suspect
period of one year prior to the opening of the judicial liquidation proceeding or occurred after the filing for the opening of the
judicial liquidation, at below market value (i.e., to the extent the asset or obligation given or undertaken exceeds by one quarter
the value of the consideration received by the debtor), or involving unusual means of payment (e.g., payment in kind) or
new security granted with respect to pre-existing debts not yet due at the time the security is entered into after the creation of
the secured obligations, unless the non-insolvent creditor proves that it had no knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at the
time the transaction was entered into, (ii) security granted during the suspect period of one year prior to the opening of the
judicial liquidation proceeding or occurred after the filing for the opening of the judicial liquidation with respect to pre-existing


-----

debts due and payable, unless the non-insolvent creditor proves that it had no knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at the time
the transaction was entered into, and (iii) payments of due and payable obligations, transactions at arm’s length or security
taken simultaneously to the creation of the secured obligations during the suspect period of one year prior to the opening of
the judicial liquidation proceeding or occurred after the filing for the opening of the judicial liquidation, if the judicial receiver
proves that the creditor was aware of the insolvency of the debtor. In case judicial liquidation is commenced after the filing
of a petition to be admitted to any insolvency proceedings, according to Article 170, paragraph 2 of the Italian Insolvency Code,
the suspect period is calculated backward from the date in which such petition is filed. The transactions potentially subject to
avoidance also include those contemplated by a Guarantor’s Guarantee or the granting of security interests under the Security
Documents by a guarantor and/or security provider. If they are challenged successfully, the rights granted under the guarantees
or in connection with security interests under the relevant Security Documents may become unenforceable and any amounts
received must be refunded to the insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of any security interest is voided, holders of the
Notes could lose the benefit of the security interest and may not be able to recover any amounts under the related Security
Documents.

It should be noted that: (i) under Article 163 of the Italian Insolvency Code, subject to certain limited exceptions, all transactions
carried out by the debtor for no consideration are ineffective vis-a-vis creditors if entered into by the debtor after the filing to
the relevant court followed by the opening of the judicial liquidation procedure or within the two years preceding the opening
of such insolvency proceeding. Any asset subject to a transaction which is ineffective pursuant to Article 163 of the Italian
Insolvency Code becomes part of the liquidation estate by operation of law upon registration (trascrizione) of the court’s
decision opening the insolvency proceeding, without needing to wait for the ineffectiveness of the transaction to be sanctioned
by a court. Any interested person may challenge the registration before the delegated judge as a violation of law, and (ii) under
Article 164 of the Italian Insolvency Code, (A) payments of receivables falling due on the day of the judicial declaration of
opening of the judicial liquidation or later, if they were executed by the debtor after the filing of the application followed by
the opening of the judicial liquidation proceedings insolvency declaration or in the prior two-year period; and B) payments
made by the debtor with respect to any intercompany loan within one year prior to a judicial liquidation declaration (or after
the filing of the application followed by the opening of the winding-up proceeding), are ineffective vis-à-vis creditors.

In addition, as noted above, the Insolvency Regulation contains conflicts of law rules which replace the various national rules
of private international law in relation to insolvency proceedings within the European Union.

**_Limitations on Enforcement_**

Under Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code, a creditor may demand that transactions whereby the insolvent entity disposed of
its assets prejudicially to such creditor’s rights be declared ineffective with respect to such creditor, provided that the insolvent
entity was aware of such prejudice (or, if the transaction was entered into prior to the date on which the claim was originated,
that such transaction was fraudulently entered into by the insolvent entity for the purpose of prejudicing the insolvent entity)
and that, in the case of a transaction entered into for consideration with a third party, the third party was aware of such prejudice
(and, if the transaction was entered into prior to the date on which the claim was originated, such third party participated in the
fraudulent design). The burden of proof is entirely with the receiver.

Law 132/2015 also introduced new Article 2929-bis to the Italian Civil Code, providing for a “simplified” clawback action for
the creditor with respect to certain types of transactions put in place by the debtor with the aim to subtract (registered) assets
from the attachment by its creditors. In particular, the creditor can now start enforcement proceedings over the relevant assets
without previously obtaining a Court decision clawing back/ nullifying the relevant (fraudulent) transaction, to the extent that
such transaction had been carried out without consideration (e.g., gratuitous transfers, or creation of shield instruments such as
trusts or the so called fondo patrimoniale or “family trust”). In case of gratuitous transfers, the enforcement action can also be
carried out by the creditor against the third-party purchaser.

**_Extraordinary Administration for Large Insolvent Companies (Amministrazione Straordinaria Delle Grandi Imprese in_**
**_Stato di Insolvenza)_**

An extraordinary administration procedure applies under Italian law for large industrial and commercial enterprises (the
_“Prodi-bis procedure”). The relevant company must be insolvent, but demonstrating serious recovery prospects. To qualify_
for this procedure, the company must have employed at least 200 employees in the previous year. In addition, it must have
debts equal to at least two-thirds of its assets as shown in its financial statements and two-thirds of its income from sales and
services during its last financial year. Any of the creditors, the debtor, a court or the public prosecutor may make a petition to
commence an extraordinary administration procedure. The same rules set forth for judicial liquidation proceedings with respect
creditors’ claims largely apply to extraordinary administration proceedings and, with respect to pending contracts, these shall
continue to be executed as long as the extraordinary commissioner does not exercise the relevant right of termination.


-----

Preferential payment is granted to those credits (even unsecured) accrued to allow the conduct of the company’s business
activity. There are two main phases: a “judicial phase” and an “administrative phase.”

(a) _Judicial Phase. In the judicial phase, the court determines whether the company meets the admission criteria_
and whether it is insolvent. It then issues a decision to that effect and appoints up to three judicial receivers
(commissiario giudiziale) to investigate whether the company has serious prospects for recovery via a
business sale or reorganization. The judicial receiver files a report with the court within 30 days, and within
ten days from such filing, the competent Italian Ministry may issue an opinion on the admission of the
company to the extraordinary administration procedure. The court then decides (within 30 days from the
filing of the report) whether to admit the company to the procedure or to place it into judicial liquidation.

(b) _Administrative Phase. Assuming that the company is admitted to the extraordinary administration procedure,_
the administrative phase begins and an extraordinary commissioner (or commissioners) is appointed by the
competent Italian Minister. The extraordinary commissioner(s) prepare(s) a plan which can provide for either
the sale of the business as a going concern within one year (unless extended by the competent Italian Ministry)
(the “Disposal Plan”) or a reorganization leading to the company’s economic and financial recovery within
two years (unless extended by the competent Italian Ministry) (the “Recovery Plan”). The plan may also
include an arrangement with creditors (e.g., a debt for equity swap, an issue of shares in a new company to
whom the assets of the company have been transferred, etc.) (concordato). The plan must be approved by the
competent Italian Ministry within 30 days from submission by the extraordinary commissioner.

In addition, the extraordinary commissioner draws up a report every six months on the financial condition and interim
management of the company and sends it to the competent Italian Ministry. The procedure ends upon successful completion
of either a Disposal Plan or a Recovery Plan, failing which the company will be adjudicated into judicial liquidation.

**_Extraordinary Administration for Large Insolvent Companies (Ristrutturazione Industriale di Grandi Imprese in Stato di_**
**_Insolvenza)_**

Introduced in 2003 pursuant to Italian Law Decree No. 347 of December 23, 2003, as converted into Italian Law No. 39 of
2004 and subsequently amended, this procedure is also known as the “Marzano procedure.” It is complementary to the Prodi_bis procedure and, except as otherwise provided, the same provisions apply. The Marzano procedure is intended to work faster_
than the Prodi-bis procedure. For example, although a company must be insolvent, the application to the Ministry can be made
before the court commences the judicial phase.

The Marzano procedure only applies to large insolvent companies which, on a consolidated basis, have at least 500 employees
in the year before the procedure is commenced and at least €300 million of debt (including those from outstanding guarantees).
The decision whether to open a Marzano procedure is taken by the Ministry following the debtor’s request (who must also file
an application for the declaration of insolvency). The Ministry assesses whether the relevant requirements are met and then
appoints the extraordinary commissioner(s) who will manage the company. The court also decides on the company’s
insolvency.

The extraordinary commissioner(s) has/have 180 days (or 270 days if the Ministry so agrees) to submit a Disposal Plan or
Recovery Plan. The restructuring through the Disposal Plan or the Recovery Plan must be completed within, respectively, one
year (extendable to two years) and two years. If no Disposal Plan or Recovery Plan is approved by the Ministry, the court will
declare the company insolvent and open a judicial liquidation.

Article 91 of the Italian Legislative Decree No. 270/1999, setting out the _Prodi-bis_ procedure and applicable also to the
_Marzano procedure provides for a special form of insolvency claw-back action (so-called revocatoria fallimentare aggravata)_
in case of intragroup transaction, pursuant to which the suspect period increases from six months to three years and from one
year to five years.

Under Italian Law, an intragroup transaction is a transaction made between two companies of the same group. According to
Article 80 of the Italian Legislative Decree No. 270/1999, a company is part of a group (impresa del gruppo) if (x) it controls
directly or indirectly the company subject to the extraordinary administration; or (y) it is directly or indirectly controlled by the
company subject to the extraordinary administration or by the company that controls the latter; or (z) it is subject, due to the
composition of the administrative bodies or other elements, to a common direction to that of the company subject to the
extraordinary administration.


-----

**_Compulsory Administrative Winding-Up (Liquidazione Coatta Amministrativa)_**

A compulsory administrative winding-up (liquidazione coatta amministrativa) is only available for public interest entities such
as state-controlled companies, insurance companies, credit institutions and other financial institutions, none of which can be
wound up pursuant to judicial liquidation proceedings. This procedure may also be applied to cooperative companies, as an
alternative to bankruptcy proceedings. It is irrelevant whether these companies belong to the public or the private sector. A
compulsory administrative winding-up is special insolvency proceedings in that the entity is liquidated not by the bankruptcy
court but by the relevant administrative authority that oversees the industry in which the entity is active. The procedure may be
triggered not only by the insolvency of the relevant entity, but also by other grounds expressly provided for by the relevant
legal provisions (e.g., in respect of Italian banks, serious irregularities concerning the management of the bank or serious
violations of the applicable legal, administrative or statutory provisions).

The effect of this procedure is that the entity loses control over its assets and a liquidator (commissario liquidatore) is appointed
to wind up the company. The liquidator’s actions are monitored by a steering committee (comitato di sorveglianza). The powers
assigned to the designated judge and the court under the other insolvency proceedings are assumed by the relevant
administrative authority under this procedure. The effect of the forced administrative winding-up on creditors is largely the
same as under insolvency proceedings and includes, for example, a ban on enforcement measures. The same rules set forth for
judicial liquidation proceedings with respect to existing contracts and creditors’ claims largely apply to extraordinary
administration proceedings.

**_Certain Limitations on Enforcement_**

The enforcement of security interests and guarantees by creditors in Italy can be complex and time consuming, especially in a
liquidation or insolvency scenario, given that Italian courts maintain a significant role in the enforcement process in comparison
to other jurisdictions with which the holders of the Notes may be familiar. The two primary goals of the Italian law are first, to
maintain employment, and second, to liquidate the debtor’s assets for the satisfaction of creditors. These competing goals often
have been balanced by the sale of businesses as going concerns and by ensuring that employees are transferred along with the
businesses being sold.

Under Italian law, in the event that an entity becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, guarantees and security interests given
by it or by way of a trust or parallel debt obligation could be subject to potential challenges by the appointed bankruptcy or
judicial liquidation receiver or by other creditors under the rules of ineffectiveness or avoidance or claw-back of Italian
Insolvency Code and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or claw-back of transactions made by the debtor during
a certain legally specified period (the “suspect period”). For a more detailed explanation of the terms, conditions and
consequences of claw-back actions in an insolvency scenario, see “—Judicial Liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale)” and “—
_Hardening period/clawback and fraudulent transfer” above._

If challenged successfully, the guarantee or the security interest may become unenforceable and any amounts received must be
refunded to the insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of any security interest or guarantee is voided, holders of the Notes
could lose the benefit of the security interest or guarantee and may not be able to recover any amounts under the related security
documents.

Furthermore, in the event that the limitations on the guarantee issued by an Italian guarantor apply and/or there are payment
obligations under any Notes other than in respect of principal or interest, the noteholders could have a reduced claim against
the relevant guarantor.

According to Italian law, the enforcement of any claims, obligations, security interest and rights in general may be subject to,
_inter alia, the following aspects:_

(a) the enforcement of obligations may be limited by the insolvency proceedings listed above relating to or
affecting the rights of creditors;

(b) an Italian court will not necessarily grant any specific enforcement or precautionary measures, the availability
of which is subject to the discretion of the Italian court;

(c) with respect to contracts providing for mutual obligations (contratti a prestazioni corrispettive), each party
can refuse to perform its obligation if the other party does not perform or does not offer to perform its own
obligation thereunder, in accordance with and subject to the provisions of Article 1460 of the Italian Civil
Code;


-----

(d) claims arising under Italian law governed documents may become barred under the provision of Italian law
concerning prescriptions and limitations by the lapse of time (prescrizioni e decadenze) or may be or become
subject to a claim of set-off (compensazione) or to counterclaim;

(e) pursuant to Article 1241 and following provisions of the Italian Civil Code concerning set-off of reciprocal
obligations (compensazione), persons who have reciprocal debt obligations may set-off such obligations for
the correspondent amount when both such debt obligations have as an object a pecuniary obligation or
fungible assets and are equally liquid and payable;

(f) where any party to any agreement or instrument is vested with discretion or may determine a matter in its
opinion, Italian law may require that such discretion is exercised reasonably or that such opinion is based on
reasonable grounds;

(g) the enforceability in Italy of obligations or contractual provisions governed by a foreign law may be limited
by the application of Italian overriding mandatory provisions (norme di applicazione necessaria) and by the
fact that the relevant provisions of foreign laws may be deemed contrary to Italian public policy principles
and there is no case law setting out specific criteria for the application of such legal concepts under Italian
law;

(h) there is some possibility that an Italian court could hold that a judgment on a particular agreement or
instrument, whether given in an Italian court or elsewhere, would supersede such agreement or instrument to
all intents and purposes, so that any obligation thereunder which by its terms would survive such judgment
might not be held to do so;

(i) enforcement of obligations may be invalidated by reason of fraud or abuse of the law (abuso del diritto);

(j) the enforceability of an obligation pursuant to the terms set forth in any agreement or instrument may be
subject to the interpretation of an Italian court which may carry out such interpretation pursuant to the
provisions of Articles 1362 and following of the Italian Civil Code;

(k) in general, under Italian law contracts can be declared null and void (nullo (Article 1418 of the Italian Civil
Code) or annullabile (Article 1425 of the Italian Civil Code));

(l) any question as to whether or not any provision of any agreement or instrument which is illegal, invalid, not
binding, unenforceable or void may be severed from the other provisions thereof in order to save those other
provisions would be determined by an Italian court on the basis of the interpretation of intention of the parties,
taking also into account the conduct of the parties following the execution of such agreement or instrument
(Article 1419 of the Italian Civil Code). Furthermore, contracts may be terminated for breach (Article 1453
of the Italian Civil Code), supervening impediment (Article 1463 of the Italian Civil Code) or excessive
onerousness (Article 1467 of the Italian Civil Code);

(m) an Italian company, either directly or indirectly, cannot grant loans or provide security interest for the
purchase or subscription of its own shares unless the strict requirements provided for in the Italian Civil Code
are satisfied;

(n) an Italian company must have a specific corporate interest in guaranteeing or securing financial obligations
of its parent company or any other companies, whether affiliated or unaffiliated with such Italian company,
such interest being determined by the relevant company on a case-by-case basis;

(o) in case of bankruptcy (filed or pending before July 15, 2022) or a judicial liquidation, a receiver is appointed
by the court to administer the proceeding under the supervision of the court and creditors’ committee and
creditors cannot start or continue individual foreclosure actions (including the enforcement of security
interests) against the debtor (automatic stay). Furthermore, the sale of the relevant pledged assets is carried
out by such receiver unless the pledgee is expressly authorized by the court or, in case of judicial liquidation,
to have the pledged assets assigned at a fair market value returning any excess to the judicial liquidation
estate;

(p) the preemption rights (prelazione) granted by a security interest extend to interest accrued in the year in
which the date of the relevant seizure/attachment or adjudication in bankruptcy/judicial liquidation falls (or,
in the absence of seizure/ attachment, at the date of the notification of the payment demand (precetto)) and


-----

extend, moreover, to interest accrued and to accrue thereafter, but only to the extent of legal interest and until
the date of the forced sale occurred in the context of the relevant foreclosure proceeding/judicial liquidation
proceedings;

(q) in order to oppose an assignment to any third party, it will be necessary to notify such assignment to the
relevant debtor or make such debtor to accept it by an instrument bearing an undisputable date (data certa)
the priority of such assignment will be determined accordingly. One way of ensuring that a document has an
indisputable date is that of ensuring that the execution of the relevant document by one of the parties to it is
witnessed by a notary who states the date of witnessing on the document, another way is to have each page
of the document stamped by the post office;

(r) there could be circumstances in which Italian law would not give effect to provisions concerning advance
waivers or forfeitures;

(s) the effectiveness of terms exculpating a party from liability or duties otherwise owed is prevented by Italian
law in the event of gross negligence (colpa grave), willful misconduct (dolo) or the violation of mandatory
provisions;

(t) penalties and liquidated damages (penali) may be equitably reduced by a court;

(u) Italian courts do not necessarily give full effect to an indemnity for the costs of enforcement or litigation;

(v) a security interest does not prevent creditors of the relevant debtor from continuing enforcement or
enforcement proceedings against the assets subject to the relevant security interest;

(w) in case of bankruptcy (filed or pending before July 15, 2022) or a judicial liquidation of the grantor of a
pledge over quotas or shares, the assets secured by the pledge could be freely sold to any third party in the
context of the relevant insolvency proceeding or in case of a judicial liquidation the pledged assets can also
be assigned to secured creditors at a fair market value and, as a consequence, the proceeds would be set aside
for the prior satisfaction of the pledgee but the pledge would be terminated and, therefore, the latter would
lose entitlement to the voting rights on the pledged quotas or shares; and

(x) any obligation secured or guaranteed by an Italian company, which is in violation of certain Italian mandatory
or public policy rules (including, inter alia, any obligation to pay: (i) any portion of applicable remuneration
(including interest, default interest, fees, charges, expenses and other costs and any other form of
compensation related to the Notes) exceeding the thresholds of the rate permitted under the Italian law no.
108 of March 7, 1996 (i.e., the “Italian Usury Law”), as amended from time to time and related implementing
rules and regulations; and (ii) any portion of interest deriving from any compounding of interest which does
not comply with Italian law, including Article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code, according to which, accrued
and unpaid interest can be capitalized only after legal proceedings to recover the debt were started or in the
event the interest were unpaid and capitalized for not less than six months based on an agreement executed
after the relevant maturity date and Article 120 of the Italian Legislative Decree no. 385/1993 (i.e., the Italian
Banking Act)) may not be enforceable.

In addition, under Italian law, in certain circumstances also in the ordinary course of business, an action can be brought by any
creditor of a given debtor within five years from the date on which the latter enters into a guarantee, security, agreement and
any other act by which it disposes of any of its assets, in order to seek a claw-back action (azione revocatoria ordinaria)
pursuant to Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code (which results in a declaration of ineffectiveness as to the acting creditor) of
the said guarantee, security, agreement and other act that is purported to be prejudicial to the acting creditor’s right of credit.
An Italian court could revoke the said guarantee, security, agreement and other act only if it, in addition to the ascertainment
of the prejudice, was to make the two following findings:

(a) that the debtor was aware of the prejudice which the act would cause to the rights of the acting creditor, or,
if such act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the act was fraudulently designed for
the purpose of prejudicing the satisfaction of the claim or credit; and

(b) that, in the case of non-gratuitous act, the third party involved was aware of said prejudice and, if the act was
done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the said third party participated in the fraudulent design.


-----

Furthermore, under fraudulent conveyance and other provisions of Italian law, a court could void or invalidate all or a portion
of the obligations of a guarantor under the relevant guarantee and, if payment had already been made under that guarantee,
require the recipients of that payment to return the payment to the relevant guarantor, if the court found that, inter alia:

(a) the relevant guarantor gave such guarantee with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud its current or future
creditors or with the intent of giving undue preference to certain creditors over others, or when the beneficiary
of the guarantee was aware that the relevant guarantor was insolvent when it gave the relevant guarantee;

(b) the relevant guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for its guarantee or
the relevant guarantor was insolvent at the time the guarantee was given;

(c) the relevant guarantee was held to exceed the corporate objects of the relevant guarantor or not to be in the
best interest or for the corporate benefit of the relevant guarantor; or

(d) the guarantor giving such guarantee was aware, or should have been aware, that the transaction was to the
detriment of the creditors.

If a court decided either that a guarantee was a fraudulent conveyance and voided such guarantee, or held it unenforceable for
any other reason, the beneficiary of the guarantee may cease to have any claim with respect to the relevant guarantor. The same
would also apply to any security interest.

**_Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of Security Interests Under Italian Law_**

_Corporate Benefit and Financial Assistance Under Italian Law_

Under Italian law, the entry into of a transaction (including the creation of a security interest or the granting of a guarantee) by
a company incorporated under Italian law must be permitted by the applicable laws and by its by-laws (statuto sociale) and is
subject to compliance with the rules on corporate benefit, corporate authorization and certain other Italian mandatory
provisions. If a security interest or a guarantee is being provided in the context of an acquisition, group reorganization,
refinancing or restructuring, financial assistance concerns may also arise.

An Italian company entering into a transaction (including granting a guarantee or a security interest) must receive a real and
adequate benefit in exchange for the guarantee or the security interest being provided by such company, so called “corporate
benefit.” The principles on corporate benefit apply equally to up-stream, down-stream and cross-stream guarantees and security
interests granted by Italian companies. The concept of real and adequate corporate benefit is not defined in the applicable
legislation, is assessed and determined by a factual analysis on a case by case basis and its existence is a business judgmentbased decision of the directors of the company and the statutory auditors, if any. As a general rule, corporate benefit is to be
assessed at the level of the relevant company on a stand-alone basis, although under certain circumstances and subject to
specific rules, the interest of the group to which such company belongs may also be taken into consideration.

While corporate benefit for a down-stream security interest or guarantee (i.e., a security interest or guarantee granted to secure
financial obligations of direct or indirect subsidiaries of the relevant grantor) can usually be easily demonstrated, the validity
and effectiveness of up-stream or cross-stream security interest or guarantee (i.e., security interest or guarantee granted to
secure financial obligations of the direct or indirect parent or sister companies of the relevant grantor) granted by an entity
organized under the laws of Italy depends on the existence of a real and adequate corporate benefit acting in as consideration
for the granted security interest or guarantee and may be challenged unless it can be proven that the grantor may derive adequate
benefit or advantage from the granting of such guarantee or security interest. The general rule is that the risk assumed by an
Italian grantor of security interest or guarantee must not be disproportionate to the direct or indirect economic benefit to it. In
particular, in the case of an up-stream or cross-stream guarantee or security interest for the financial obligations of group
companies, examples may include financial consideration in the form of access by the relevant company to cash flows through
intercompany loans from other members of the group, while transactions featuring debt financings of distributions to
shareholders are largely untested in Italian courts, and, therefore, limited guidance is available as to whether and to what extent
such transactions could be challenged for lack of real and adequate corporate benefit and conflict of interest. As a general rule,
the absence of a real and adequate corporate benefit could render the transaction (including the granting of a security interest
or a guarantee entered into) by an Italian company as ultra vires and potentially affected by a conflict of interest and the related
corporate resolutions adopted by the shareholders and directors may be the subject matter of challenges and annulment. Civil
liabilities may be imposed on the directors of an Italian grantor if a court holds that it did not act in the best interest of the
grantor and that the acts carried out do not fall within the corporate purpose of the company or were against mandatory
provisions of Italian law. The lack of corporate benefit could also result in the imposition of civil liabilities on those companies
or persons ultimately exercising control over an Italian grantor or having knowingly received an advantage or profit from such


-----

improper control. Moreover, the transaction (including the security interest or guarantee granted by an Italian company) could
be declared null and void if the lack of corporate benefit was known or presumed to be known by the third party and such third
party acted intentionally against the interest of the Italian company.

Upon certain conditions, the granting of a guarantee or a security interest may be considered as a restricted financial activity
within the meaning of Article 106 of the Italian Legislative Decree no. 385/1993 (i.e., the “Italian Banking Act”), which only
banks and authorized financial intermediaries are qualified to carry out. Non-compliance with the provisions of the Italian
Banking Act may, among others, entail the relevant guarantees and security interests being considered null and void. In this
respect, Italian Ministerial Decree No. 53 of April 2, 2015, implementing Article 106, Paragraph 3, of the Italian Banking Act,
states that the issuance of guarantees or the granting of security interest by a company for the obligations of another company
which is part of the same group does not qualify as a restricted financial activity, whereby “group” includes controlling and
controlled companies within the meaning of Article 2359 of the Italian Civil Code as well as companies which are under the
control of the same entity. As a result of the rules described above, subject to the relevant guarantors or security providers and
the guaranteed entity being members of the same group of companies, the provision of the guarantees and security interests
would not amount to a restricted financial activity.

_Financial Assistance_

In addition, the granting of a security interest or a guarantee by an Italian company cannot be granted in support of any liability
which would result in unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of Article 2358 or 2474, as the case may be, of the
Italian Civil Code pursuant to which, subject to specific exceptions, it is unlawful for a company to give financial assistance
(whether by means of loans, security, guarantees or otherwise) to support the acquisition, or subscription by a third party, of
its own shares or quotas or those of any entity that (directly or indirectly) controls such Italian company. Financial assistance
provided by an Italian company for the refinancing of indebtedness originally incurred for the purchase or subscription of its
own shares or quotas or those of its direct or indirect parent company would also be a violation of financial assistance
provisions. Any loan, guarantee or security given or granted in breach of these provisions is null and void. In addition, directors
may be personally liable for failure to act in the best interests of the company.

_Maximum Guaranteed Amount_

Pursuant to Article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code, if a guarantee granted by a company incorporated under the laws of Italy
(each an “Italian Guarantor”) is issued to guarantee conditional or future obligations, the guarantee must be limited to a
maximum amount. Such maximum amount should be expressly identified at the outset and expressed in figures (either in the
guarantee deed or by reference to a separate document, such as the Indenture). In addition, as mentioned above, the guarantees
granted by an Italian Guarantor must be supported by corporate benefit; in other words, the maximum guaranteed amount must
be indicated in the guarantee and shall not exceed the financial capabilities of the relevant Italian Guarantors. It has been held,
that such determination must be proportionate to the relevant guarantor’s assets. If such determination is deemed
disproportional to the assets of the relevant Italian Guarantor, there is the risk that the guarantee could be declared void.

_Limitation Language_

In order to comply with applicable Italian law requirements on, _inter alia, corporate benefit and financial assistance, the_
maximum amount that any Italian Guarantor may be required to pay in respect of its obligations as Guarantor will be subject
to limitations. By virtue of these limitations, an Italian Guarantor’s obligation under its Notes Guarantee may be significantly
less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or an Italian Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Notes
Guarantee and the security interest granted by it. Therefore, the limitation language for any Italian Guarantor to be included
into the relevant Notes documents, in particular in the Indenture, will substantially be in the form as follows:

(a) the restrictions in the guarantee clause of the Indenture shall apply to any guarantee, indemnity, liability and
other payment obligations under the Indenture and/or any other documents (including, without limitation,
any security document granted by an Italian Guarantor) to secure liabilities of any Obligor arising under the
Notes documents (without duplication for the similar guarantee obligations assumed pursuant to clause 20.15
of the Second Lien Credit Facilities Agreement, clause 23.16 of the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement,
schedules 7 and 8 to the Intercreditor Agreement, section 11.02 of the indentures relating to the Existing
Notes and/or security obligations provided for under the security documents granted by an Italian Guarantor),
which in any case shall not exceed the difference between:

(i) the maximum aggregate amount of any intercompany loan or other financial support in any form
(such term, for the avoidance of doubt, not including equity contributions) made available at any
time to that Italian Guarantor (or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries pursuant to article 2359 of


-----

the Italian civil code) after the date of entering into the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement by any
Obligor (whether directly or indirectly), and is outstanding as at the date of the event which triggered
the enforceability of the guarantee granted by that Italian Guarantor. No Italian Guarantor shall
moreover be liable for any amount in excess of the amount that such Italian Guarantor is entitled to
set off against its claims of recourse or subrogation (regresso or surrogazione) arising as a result of
the enforcement of the relevant guarantee; and

(ii) the aggregate amount that, at the time of the enforcement of the guarantee provided for under the
Indenture (as well as clause 20.15 of the Second Lien Credit Facilities Agreement, clause 23.16 of
the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, schedules 7 and 8 to the Intercreditor Agreement, section
11.02 of the indentures relating to the Existing Notes and/or the security interests granted by an
Italian Guarantor (each an “Italian Security Interest”)), such Italian Guarantor has already been
required to pay or has actually paid as a result of an enforcement demand under the Indenture, the
Second Lien Credit Facilities Agreement, the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, the Intercreditor
Agreement, the indentures relating to the Existing Notes and/or the security interests granted by the
relevant Italian Guarantor;

(b) notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Notes documents, any guarantee, indemnity, obligations
(including, without limitation, any security obligations) and liability granted or assumed pursuant to the Notes
by an Italian Guarantor shall not include and shall not extend, directly or indirectly, to any amount the purpose
or the actual use of which is to finance, directly or indirectly, the acquisition or subscription, directly or
indirectly, of the shares or quotas in such Italian Guarantor or any direct or indirect controlling entity of such
Italian Guarantor and/or the payment of any fees, costs and expenses, stamp, registration or other taxes in
connection therewith (or to refinance any indebtedness incurred for such purposes) or to any obligations
incurred by any other guarantor under any guarantee given by such other guarantor for the same purposes,
so as to exclude any case of undue financial assistance pursuant to article 2358 and/or 2474 of the Italian
Civil Code;

(c) notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Notes documents, in order to comply with the mandatory
provisions of Italian law in relation to (a) maximum interest rates (including the Italian Usury Law and Article
1815 of the Italian Civil Code) and (b) capitalization of interests (including Article 1283 of the Italian Civil
Code and Article 120 of the Italian Banking Act), the obligations of any Italian Guarantor shall not include
and shall not extend to (1) any interest qualifying as usurious pursuant to Italian Usury Law and (2) any
interest on overdue amounts compounded in violation of the provisions set forth by Article 1283 of the Italian
Civil Code and/or Article 120 of the Italian Banking Act;

(d) notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Notes documents, each Italian Guarantor shall be entitled
to set-off its obligations relating to a loan and/or financial support received by any other Obligor against the
claims of recourse or subrogation (“regresso” or “surrogazione”) against that Obligor arising as a result of
any payment of the obligations of that Obligor made by such Italian Guarantor under the guarantee clause of
the Indenture, the Second Lien Credit Facilities Agreement, the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, the
Intercreditor Agreement and/or the indentures relating to the Existing Notes or as a result of the enforcement
of any Italian Security Interests;

(e) without prejudice to paragraph (a) above, pursuant to article 1938 of the Italian civil code, the maximum
amount that an Italian Guarantor may be required to pay under the Indenture shall not exceed EUR
177,000,000 (or its equivalent in any other currency).

The proceeds of the enforcement of said guarantees and/or security interests will be distributed amongst the guaranteed and/or
secured creditors (including, without, limitation, the holders of the Notes) in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor
Agreement. Accordingly, the holders of the Notes may be able to recover limited amounts under the relevant Notes Guarantees
and security.

In any case, the maximum amount that an Italian Guarantor may be required to pay in respect of its obligations as Guarantor
under the Indenture and/or security grantor under the relevant security documents upon enforcement of the security interests
granted by such Italian Guarantor will rateably concur and not cumulate with the corresponding amounts due by such Italian
Guarantor to any guaranteed and/or secured creditor pursuant to the Second Lien Credit Facilities Agreement, the Senior Credit
Facilities Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement and the indentures relating to the Existing Notes (including any guaranteed
and/or secured creditors with respect to any further pari passu indebtedness contemplated under the Intercreditor Agreement)


-----

and/or any security documents, and _vice versa. For the avoidance of doubt, by virtue of the abovementioned limitations_
applicable to the guarantees and the security interests granted by an Italian Guarantor, the obligations of each Italian Guarantor
as guarantor and/or security provider under the Notes, the Indenture, the Second Lien Credit Facilities Agreement, the Senior
Credit Facilities Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement, the indenture relating to the Existing Notes and any agreement
regulating future pari passu indebtedness contemplated under the Intercreditor Agreement-the security documents relating to
the Collateral and any other transaction documents related thereto shall not be deemed to be cumulative and shall be considered
without duplication, and the transaction documents will provide that the aggregate amount of the proceeds deriving from any
enforcement of any such guarantee and/or security obligations of the relevant Italian Guarantor shall not exceed on an aggregate
basis the limit of the relevant Italian Guarantor’s credit support as described above.

_Trust and parallel debt_

Under Italian law the beneficiary of a security interest must be clearly identified and indicated in the relevant security document.
Due to the impossibility to clearly identify and keep track over time of the names of the individual holder of the Notes, the
Italian security will be created in favor of the Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes and in favor of the Security Agent
as representative of all secured creditors. It is uncertain and untested in the Italian courts whether, under Italian law, a security
interest can be created and perfected: (i) in favor of creditors (such as the holders of the Notes) which are neither directly parties
to the relevant security documents or are not specifically identified therein or in the relevant share certificates and corporate
documents or public registries; and (ii) in favor of a “trustee,” since there is no established concept of “trust” or “trustee” under
Italian law and the precise nature, effect and enforceability of the duties, rights and powers of a “trustee” as agent or trustee
under security interests granted over Italian assets is uncertain under Italian law.

Given the above and considering that the holders of the Notes are not party to the Italian law governed security documents,
there is a risk that an Italian court may determine that the holders of the Notes (in relation to which the relevant perfection
formalities acknowledging their status as a secured creditor are not perfected at the time of enforcement) are not secured by the
security interests created under the Italian law governed security documents and/or cannot enforce that security interest.

To address the above potential issue, the collateral securing the Notes will be granted and perfected in favor of the Trustee and
in favor of Security Agent acting also in its capacity as legal representative (mandatario con rappresentanza) of the holders of
the Notes.

In bond issuances made by Italian joint stock companies (società per azioni), pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the
Italian Civil Code (introduced by Law No. 164 of November 11, 2014), security interests can be validly created in favor of an
agent (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes who will then be authorized to enforce them on behalf of the holders of the
Notes. The security governed by Italian law will be created and perfected in favor of the Trustee and in favor of Security Agent
acting also as rappresentante of the holders of the Notes in accordance with such Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian
Civil Code to the extent applicable. However, there is no guidance or available case law on the exercise of the rights and
enforcement of such security interest and guarantee by a rappresentante pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian
Civil Code also in the name and on behalf of the holders of the Notes which are neither directly parties to the Collateral nor are
specifically identified therein or in the relevant share certificates and corporate documents or public registries. Furthermore, it
is untested in Italian courts whether guarantees and security interests can effectively be granted in favor of an entity acting as
“rappresentante” of the noteholders pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code in connection with
notes issued by an entity incorporated outside of Italy and absent a resolution by the competent corporate body of the foreign
issuer appointing a notary to carry out any formality required under the laws of Italy for the creation of security interests.

The Indenture might also provide for the creation of a “parallel debt”. Pursuant to the parallel debt claim and subject to the
terms of the Indenture and to applicable law, the Security Agent, in its individual capacity acting in its own name and not as
agent or representative of the holders of the Notes, shall become the holder of a claim equal to each amount payable by an
obligor under the Notes. However, parallel debt structures included in the Indenture, according to which the security interest is
also granted in favor of the Security Agent as beneficiary of parallel debt obligations against the Issuer, which will be discharged
to the extent the corresponding principal payment obligations of the Issuer under the Indenture and the Notes are discharged,
have, to date, not been tested under Italian law. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the enforceability of a security
interest governed by Italian law securing a parallel debt obligation will be upheld by an Italian court and further no assurance
can be provided on how an Italian court would interpret an Italian law security instrument purporting to secure, _inter alia, a_
“parallel debt” obligation.

_Undercapitalization_

Italian corporate law (Articles 2497-quinquies and 2467 of the Italian Civil Code) provides for rules to protect creditors against
“undercapitalized companies” and provides for remedies in respect thereof. In this respect, in case of a loan to a company made


-----

by (i) a person that, directly or indirectly, directs the company or exercises management and coordination powers over that
borrowing company or (ii) any entity subject to the management and coordination powers of the same person or (iii) a
quotaholder in the case of a company incorporated in Italy as a società a responsabilità limitata, such loan will be subordinated
to all other creditors of that borrower and rank senior only to the equity in that borrower, if the loan is made when, taking into
account the kind of business of the borrower, there was an excessive imbalance of the borrower’s indebtedness compared to its
net assets or the borrower was already in a financial situation requiring an injection of equity and not a loan
(“undercapitalization”). Pursuant to Article 164 of the Italian Insolvency Code, any payment made by the borrower with respect
to any such loan within one year prior to the filing of a petition that results in the declaration of judicial liquidation or after
such filing are ineffective by operation of law. The new provision replaced Article 2467, paragraph 1, of the Italian Civil Code,
according to which such payments would be required to be returned to the borrower. For a more detailed explanation of the
terms, conditions and consequences of claw back actions in an insolvency scenario, see “Certain Italian Insolvency Laws
_Considerations—Judicial Liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale)” and “Hardening Period/Clawback and Fraudulent Transfer”_
above. In addition to that, Article 292, paragraph 1, of the Italian Insolvency Code sets forth that claims of entities exercising
management and coordination powers vis-à-vis the entities subject to such powers and claims of the entities subject to such
powers vis-à-vis the entities exercising them deriving from loans granted after the filing of petitions resulting in the opening of
judicial liquidation or in the year before, are subordinated.

The above rules apply to shareholders’ loans “made in any form” and scholars generally conclude that such provisions should
be interpreted broadly and apply to any form of financial support provided to a company by its shareholders, either directly or
indirectly.

As of the date hereof, there are several court precedents interpreting the provisions summarized above. Some of such precedents
have held that article 2467 of the Italian Civil Code also applies to companies incorporated as _società per azioni, hence_
potentially to the borrowers under the intercompany loans that are a società per azioni.

Therefore, upon the occurrence of the requirements provided for by the relevant provisions, Italian courts may apply such
provisions of the Italian Civil Code to the Issuer’s relationship with Italian subsidiaries under the relevant intercompany loans,
if any. Accordingly, an Italian court may conclude that the obligations of any Italian subsidiary under any intercompany loan
are subordinated to all its obligations towards other creditors. Should any of the obligations of any subsidiary under any
intercompany loan or note be deemed subordinated to the obligations owed to other creditors by operation of law and senior
only to the equity, the Issuer may not be able to recover any amounts under any intercompany loan or note granted to the Italian
subsidiaries, which could have a material adverse effect on the Issuer’s ability to meet its payment obligations under the Notes.

Moreover, in circumstances where any obligations of an Italian subsidiary under any intercompany loans or notes is
subordinated by operation of law, the ability of the holders of the Notes to recover under any Collateral created over such
intercompany loans or notes or any guarantees granted by such Italian subsidiaries may be impaired or restricted.

_Risks Related to Pledges Over Bank Accounts_

The enforceability and perfection of a pledge over bank accounts would be subject to the service on the relevant account bank
of a notice bearing a date certain at law (data certa) or obtainment of an acceptance bearing a date certain at law (data certa)
from the relevant account bank each time the balance of the accounts changes and, based on a certain line of interpretation,
there is a risk that the pledge purported to be created over each increase in the balance of the relevant account may not exist
until the above formalities are carried out and that such pledge be considered a new and different pledge to all intents and
purposes. Therefore, the holders of the Notes would lose the benefit of the relevant security interest in case of failure to take
the actions required to re-perfect the security interest and, however, a new hardening period would start to run from the date
on which the relevant perfection formalities are repeated.

_Risks Related to Pledges Granted Pursuant to the Italian Decree 170/2004_

The Italian security documents may contain an express reference to Legislative Decree No. 170 of 21 May 2004 as amended
by Legislative Decree No. 48 of 24 March 2011 (Decree 170), which implemented in Italy Directive 2002/47/EC of the
European Parliament and of the Council of 6 June 2002 on financial collateral arrangements. Decree 170 is applicable, inter
_alia, to the extent that parties to collateral arrangements fall under certain categories listed therein. Should the relevant parties_
to the Italian security documents do not fall under any of the categories provided under Decree 170, the relevant provisions of
Decree 170 would not apply to the pledges purported to be created under the relevant Italian security documents. In addition,
in the absence of court precedents on the point, it might be disputable whether the shares represented by shares certificates
pledged under an Italian security document by qualify as eligible financial instruments (strumenti finanziari) for the purposes
of Decree 170, considering that although company shares are expressly listed by way of example in the definition of financial
instruments provided under article 1 _bis of Legislative Decree No. 58 of 24 February 1998 (and adopted by way of express_


-----

reference by Decree 170), the financial instruments generally (including the shares companies) are required to be categories of
securities negotiable in the capital markets (categorie di valori che possono essere negoziati sul mercato dei capitali). Should
the relevant requirement be construed as the potential ability for shares to be traded on capital markets, the shares pledged by
the relevant Italian security document would fall within the definition of financial instruments adopted by Decree 170 and, as
such, would be eligible for the purpose of application of Decree 170; should, on the contrary, the relevant requirement be
construed as the actual ability for shares to be traded on capital markets, the shares pledged by the relevant Italian security
document, which are not listed on a regulated market or traded on another capital market, would not be eligible for the purpose
of application of Decree 170.

**The Netherlands**

**_Limitation on Enforcement_**

If a Dutch company grants a guarantee or security interest and that guarantee or security interest is not in the company’s
corporate interest, the guarantee or security interest may be nullified by the Dutch company, its receiver (curator) in bankruptcy
(faillissement) and its administrator (bewindvoerder) in moratorium of payment proceedings (surseance van betaling) or
otherwise and, as a consequence, not be valid, binding and enforceable against it. In determining whether the granting of a
guarantee or security interest is in the interest of a Dutch company, Dutch courts would not only consider the text of the objects
clause in the articles of association (statuten) of the company but all relevant circumstances, including (i) whether the company
irrespective of the wording of the objects clause derives certain commercial benefits from the transaction in respect of which
the guarantee or security interest was granted and (ii) the balance between the risk that the company is assuming and the benefit
it derives from such transaction. In addition, if it is determined that there are no, or insufficient, commercial benefits from the
transactions for the company that grants the guarantee or security interest, then such company (and any bankruptcy receiver)
may challenge the enforcement of the guarantee or security interest, and it is possible that such challenge would be successful.
Such benefit may, according to Dutch case law, consist of an indirect benefit derived by the company as a consequence of the
interdependence of such company with the group of companies to which it belongs. In addition, it is relevant whether, as a
consequence of the granting of the guarantee or security interest, the continuity of such company would foreseeably be
endangered by the granting of such guarantee or security interest. It remains possible that even if such strong financial and
commercial interdependence exists, the transaction may be declared void if it appears that the granting of the guarantee or
security interest cannot serve the realization of the relevant company’s objects or where it is determined that there is a material
imbalance to the disadvantage of the company between the commercial benefit on the one hand and the risks on the other hand.
The above ultra vires concepts also apply with respect to any security interest granted or other legal act entered into by a Dutch
company.

If Dutch law applies, a guarantee or security governed by Dutch law may be voided by a court, if the document was executed
through undue influence (misbruik van omstandigheden), fraud (bedrog), duress (bedreiging) or mistake (dwaling) of a party
to the agreement contained in that document.

Payment pursuant to a guarantee or following enforcement or foreclosure of security granted may, regardless of an insolvency
situation occurring or not, also be withheld due to unforeseen circumstances (onvoorziene omstandigheden), force majeure
(niet-toerekenbare tekortkoming) or reasonableness and fairness (redelijkheid en billijkheid). Other impeding factors include
the right to suspend performance (opschorting), dissolution (ontbinding) of contract and set off (verrekening).

In addition, a guarantee issued by a Dutch company and a security interest provided by a Dutch company may be suspended or
avoided by the Enterprise Chamber of the Court of Appeal in Amsterdam (Ondernemingskamer van het Gerechtshof te
_Amsterdam) on the motion of the holder or holders of 10% or more of the shares in such company or shares or depositary_
receipts issued therefor with a nominal value of €225,000 or more or such lesser amount as provided in the company’s articles
of association, as well as on the motion of a trade union and of other entities entitled thereto in the articles of association of the
relevant Dutch company. Likewise, the guarantee or security itself may be upheld by the Enterprise Chamber, yet actual
payment under it may be suspended or avoided.

**_Parallel Debt_**

Under Dutch law, certain “accessory” security interests such as pledges require that the pledgee and the creditor be the same
person. Such security interests cannot be held by a third party which does not hold the secured claim but purports to hold
security interests for the parties that do. The beneficial holders of the Notes from time to time will not be party to the Security
Documents. In order to permit the holders of the Notes from time to time to have a secured claim, the Intercreditor Agreement
provides for the creation of a “parallel debt.” Pursuant to the parallel debt, the Security Agent becomes the holder of a claim
equal to each amount payable by an obligor under the Notes. The pledges governed by Dutch law will directly secure the


-----

parallel debt. The parallel debt structure has not been tested under Dutch law, and there is no certainty that it will eliminate or
mitigate the risk of unenforceability posed by Dutch law.

**_Fraudulent Transfer_**

To the extent that Dutch law applies, a guarantee or security interest granted by a legal entity may, under certain circumstances,
be nullified by any of its creditors, if (i) the guarantee or security interest was granted without prior existing legal obligation to
do so (onverplicht), (ii) the creditor concerned was prejudiced as a consequence of the guarantee or the granting of the security
interest and (iii) at the time the guarantee or security interest was granted both the legal entity and, unless the guarantee or
security interest was granted for no consideration (om niet), the beneficiary of the guarantee or security interest knew or should
have known that one or more of the entities’ creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced (actio pauliana). Also to the
extent that Dutch insolvency law applies, a guarantee or security interest may be nullified by the bankruptcy receiver on behalf
of and for the benefit of all creditors of the insolvent debtor, and in such case the beneficiary of the guarantee or security interest
is presumed (subject to evidence to the contrary) to have known that creditors of the debtor would be prejudiced if the
bankruptcy follows within a year of the granting and for no consideration. The foregoing requirements apply mutatis mutandis
for such actions. In addition, the bankruptcy receiver may challenge the guarantee or security interest if it was granted on the
basis of a prior existing legal obligation to do so (verplichte rechtshandeling), if (i) the guarantee or security interest was
granted at a time that the beneficiary of such guarantee or security interest knew that a request for bankruptcy had been filed
or (ii) if such guarantee or security interest was granted as a result of deliberation between the debtor and the beneficiary of
such guarantee or security interest with a view to give preference to the beneficiary over the debtor’s other creditors.
Consequently, the validity of any guarantees or security interests granted by a Dutch legal entity may be challenged and it is
possible that such challenge would be successful.

If a security right is created in collateral to which a Dutch company has not yet obtained title, such collateral will not be subject
to such a security interest if that company is declared bankrupt or granted a moratorium of payments prior to obtaining title
thereto.

It is not possible to conduct searches in respect of any Dutch law governed security (other than in respect of rights of mortgage,
if any), except that any security created over the shares in a Dutch company should be registered in its shareholders’ register.
However, this does not constitute conclusive evidence of the absence of any pre-existing security.

**_Insolvency_**

Where a company (incorporated in the Netherlands or elsewhere) has its “centre of main interests” or an “establishment” in the
Netherlands, it may be subjected to Dutch insolvency proceedings governed by Dutch insolvency laws, subject to certain
exceptions provided for in the E.U. Insolvency Regulation. See “—European Union.” This is particularly relevant for EG
Dutch Finco B.V., EG Holdings B.V., EG Europe B.V., EG Retail B.V., EG (Benelux) B.V., EG Retail (Netherlands) B.V.,
EG Services (Netherlands) B.V., EG (France) B.V., EG (Italy) B.V. and EG (Germany) B.V. (collectively the “Dutch
Guarantors” and each a “Dutch Guarantor”), which have their corporate seat (statutaire zetel) in Breda, the Netherlands, and
are therefore presumed (subject to proof to the contrary) to have their “centre of main interests” in the Netherlands.
Consequently, in the event of an insolvency of a Dutch Guarantor, insolvency proceedings are likely to be initiated in the
Netherlands.

Dutch insolvency laws may not be as favorable to your interests as creditors as the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions. The
following is a brief description of certain aspects of Dutch insolvency law.

There are three primary insolvency regimes under Dutch law: the first, moratorium of payments (surseance van betaling), is
intended to facilitate the reorganization of a debtor’s indebtedness and enable the debtor to continue as a going concern. The
second, bankruptcy (faillissement), is primarily designed to liquidate assets and distribute the proceeds of the assets of a debtor
to its creditors. The third, the out of court restructuring plan (onderhand akkoord) procedure, is also intended to facilitate the
reorganization of a debtor’s debt and enable the debtor to continue as a going concern. All insolvency regimes are set forth in
the Dutch Bankruptcy Act. In practice, a suspension of payments often results in bankruptcy. A general description of the
principles of the insolvency regimes is set out below.

An application for a moratorium (or suspension) of payments can only be made by the debtor itself, and only if it foresees that
it will be unable to continue payments when they fall due and could be used as a defense by the debtor against a bankruptcy
application by a creditor. Once the request for a moratorium of payments is filed, a court will immediately (dadelijk) grant a
provisional moratorium and appoint one or more administrators (bewindvoerders). A meeting of creditors is required to decide
on the definitive moratorium. If a draft composition (ontwerp akkoord) is filed simultaneously with the application for
moratorium of payments, the court can order that the composition will be processed before a decision about a definitive


-----

moratorium. If the composition is accepted and subsequently ratified by the court (gehomologeerd), the provisional moratorium
ends. The definitive moratorium will generally be granted unless a qualified minority (more than one-quarter in amount of
claims held by creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting or more than one-third in number of creditors represented at such
creditors’ meeting) of the unsecured non-preferential creditors withholds its consent or if there is a valid fear that the debtor
will try to prejudice the creditors during a moratorium of payments or if there is no prospect that the debtor will be able to
satisfy its creditors in the (near) future. The moratorium of payments is only effective with regard to unsecured non-preferential
creditors.

Unlike Chapter 11 proceedings under U.S. bankruptcy law, during which both secured and unsecured creditors are generally
barred from seeking to recover on their claims during a moratorium of payments, under Dutch law, secured and preferential
creditors (including tax and social security authorities) may enforce their rights against assets of the company in moratorium
of payments to satisfy their claims as if there were no moratorium of payments. A recovery under Dutch law could, therefore,
involve a sale of assets that does not reflect the going concern value of the debtor. However, the court may order a “cooling
down period” (afkoelingsperiode) for a maximum period of four months during which enforcement actions by secured or
preferential creditors are barred. Both in a definitive moratorium of payments and bankruptcy, a composition (akkoord) may
be offered to creditors. A composition will be binding on all unsecured and non-preferential creditors if it is approved by (i) a
simple majority in number of the creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting, representing at least 50% in amount of the
claims that are acknowledged and conditionally admitted for voting purposes and (ii) subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd)
by the court. Consequently, Dutch insolvency laws could preclude or inhibit the ability of the holders of the Notes to effect a
restructuring and could reduce the recovery of a holder of Notes in Dutch moratorium of payments proceedings or bankruptcy.
Interest payments that fall due after the date on which a moratorium of payments is granted cannot be claimed in a composition.

Under Dutch law, a debtor can be declared bankrupt when it has ceased to pay its debts. The bankruptcy can be requested by a
creditor of the debtor or the holders of a security interest over a claim from such a creditor, when there is at least one other
creditor. At least one of the claims (of the creditor of the debtor requesting bankruptcy or the other creditor of the debtor) needs
to be due and payable. The debtor can also request the application of bankruptcy proceedings itself.

Under Dutch bankruptcy proceedings, the assets of a debtor are generally liquidated and the proceeds distributed to the debtor’s
creditors in accordance with the respective rank and priority of their claims. The general principle of Dutch bankruptcy law is
the so-called paritas creditorum (principle of equal treatment) which means that all creditors have an equal right to payment
and that the proceeds of bankruptcy proceedings shall be distributed in proportion to the size of their claims. However, certain
creditors (such as secured creditors and tax and social security authorities) will have special rights that take priority over the
rights of other creditors. Consequently, Dutch insolvency laws could reduce your potential recovery in Dutch bankruptcy
proceedings.

The claim of a creditor may be limited depending on the date the claim becomes due and payable in accordance with its terms.
Generally, all unsecured, pre-bankruptcy claims of the holders of Notes that were not due and payable by their terms on the
date of a bankruptcy of the relevant Guarantor will be accelerated and become due and payable as of that date. Each of these
claims will have to be submitted to the bankruptcy receiver to be verified. “Verification” under Dutch law means, in case of a
moratorium of payments, that the receiver determines the value of the claim and whether and to what extent it will be admitted
in the bankruptcy proceedings to the purpose of the distribution of the proceeds. The valuation of claims that otherwise would
not have been payable at the time of the bankruptcy proceedings may be based on a net present value analysis. Interest payments
that fall due after the date of the bankruptcy cannot be verified. Where interest is accruing after the date of opening of the
proceedings, it can be admitted pro memoria. The existence, value and ranking of any claims submitted by the holders of Notes
may be challenged in the Dutch bankruptcy proceedings. Generally, in a creditors’ meeting (verificatievergadering), the
bankruptcy receiver, the insolvent debtor and all verified creditors may dispute the verification of claims of other creditors.
Creditors whose claims or value thereof are disputed in the creditors’ meeting may be referred to separate court proceedings
(renvooiprocedure). These procedures could cause the holders of Notes to recover less than the principal amount of their Notes
or less than they could recover in a U.S. liquidation. Such renvooi proceedings could also cause payments to the holders of
Notes to be delayed compared with holders of undisputed claims. As in moratorium of payments proceedings, in a bankruptcy
a composition may be offered to creditors, which shall be binding on unsecured non-preferential creditors if it is approved by
(i) a majority in number of the creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting, representing at least 50% in amount of the claims
that are admitted for voting purposes and (ii) subsequently confirmed by the court. The Dutch Bankruptcy Act does not in itself
recognize the concept of classes of creditors. Remaining amounts, if any, after satisfaction of the secured and the preferential
creditors are distributed among the unsecured non-preferential creditors, who will be satisfied on a pro rata basis. Contractual
subordination may to a certain extent be given effect in Dutch insolvency proceedings. The actual effect depends largely on
the way such subordination is construed.


-----

Secured or preferential creditors (including tax and social security authorities) may enforce their rights against assets of the
debtor to satisfy their claims under a Dutch bankruptcy as if there is no bankruptcy. As in moratorium of payments proceedings,
the court may order a “cooling down period” (afkoelingsperiode) for a maximum of four months during which enforcement
actions by secured or preferential creditors are barred unless such creditors have obtained leave for enforcement from the
supervisory judge (rechtercommissaris). Further, a receiver in bankruptcy can force a secured creditor to enforce its security
interest within a reasonable period of time, failing which the receiver will be entitled to sell the secured assets, if any, and the
secured creditor will have to share in the bankruptcy costs, which may be significant. Excess proceeds of enforcement must be
returned to the bankrupt estate; they may not be set-off against an unsecured claim of the secured creditor in the bankruptcy.
Such set-off is allowed prior to the bankruptcy, although a set-off prior to bankruptcy may be subject to claw-back in the case
of fraudulent conveyance or bad faith in obtaining the claim used for set-off.

Moreover, to the extent that Dutch law applies, a legal act performed by a debtor (including, without limitation, an agreement
pursuant to which it guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides security for
any of its or a third party’s obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from existing security and any other legal
act having a similar effect) can be challenged in an insolvency proceeding or otherwise and may be nullified by any of its
creditors or its trustee in bankruptcy, if (i) it performed such acts without an obligation to do so (onverplicht), (ii) generally the
creditor concerned or, in the case of its bankruptcy, any creditor was prejudiced as a consequence of the act, and (iii) at the
time the act was performed both it and (unless the act was for no consideration (om niet)) the party with or towards which it
acted, knew or should have known that one or more of its creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced. In addition, in the
case of such a bankruptcy, their trustee may nullify its performance of any due and payable obligation (including (without
limitation) an obligation to provide security for any of its or a third party’s obligations) if (i) the payee (hij die betaling ontving)
knew that a request for bankruptcy had been filed at the moment of payment, or (ii) the performance of the obligation was the
result of a consultation between the debtor and the payee with a view to give preference to the latter over the debtor’s other
creditors. Whether or not a Guarantor is insolvent in the Netherlands, pursuant to Dutch law, payment under a guarantee or a
security document may be withheld under the doctrines of reasonableness and fairness (redelijkheid en billijkheid), force
majeure and unforeseen circumstances (onvoorziene omstandigheden).

Any pending executions of judgments against the debtor will be suspended by operation of law when suspension of payments
is granted and terminate by operation of law when bankruptcy is declared. In addition, all attachments on the debtor’s assets
will cease to have effect upon the suspension of payments having become definitive, a composition having been ratified by the
court or the declaration of bankruptcy (as the case may be) subject to the ability of the court to set an earlier date for such
termination. Litigation pending on the date of the bankruptcy order is automatically stayed. Under Dutch law, bankruptcy and
suspension of payment generally take effect at 00.00 a.m. on the day of the judgement of the bankruptcy or the suspension of
payments.

With the entry into force of the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans (Wet homologatie onderhands
_akkoord) (“WHOA”) on 1 January 2021, debtors now have the possibility to offer a composition outside of formal insolvency_
proceedings. Unlike a composition in suspension of payments and in bankruptcy proceedings, a composition under the WHOA
can be offered to secured creditors as well as shareholders. The WHOA provides, _inter alia, for cross class cramdown, the_
restructuring of group company obligations through aligned proceedings, the termination of onerous contracts, the suspension
of certain ipso facto clauses in contracts and supporting court measures. A WHOA composition may result in claims against a
Dutch Guarantor being compromised if the relevant majority votes in favor of such a composition and it is subsequently
confirmed by the Dutch courts. A composition plan under the WHOA can extend to claims against entities that are not
incorporated under Dutch law and/or are residing outside the Netherlands. Accordingly, the WHOA can affect the rights of the
noteholders.

Voting on a WHOA composition plan is done in classes. A class is deemed to accept the plan if two thirds of the total amount
of the debt of that class or, in the case of a class of shareholders, two thirds of the share capital of that class, participating in the
vote, votes in favor. The WHOA provides for the possibility for a composition plan to be binding on a dissenting class (i.e.,
cross class cramdown). Under the WHOA, the court will confirm a composition plan if at least one class of creditors (other
than a class of shareholders) that can be expected to receive a distribution in case of a bankruptcy of the debtor approves the
plan, unless there is a statutory ground for refusal. The court can, inter alia, refuse confirmation of a composition plan on the
basis of (i) a request by a dissenting creditor, if the value of the distribution that such creditor receives under the plan is lower
than the distribution it can be expected to receive in case of a bankruptcy of the debtor or (ii) a request of a dissenting creditor
in a dissenting class, if the plan provides for a distribution of value that deviates from the statutory or contractual ranking and
priority to the detriment of that class, unless there is a reasonable ground to do so. There is one mandatory refusal ground
specifically applicable to secured financial creditors. If the composition plan entails a debt-for-equity swap to which such
creditors do not want to ascribe, and these creditors do not have the right to opt for a different kind of distribution, the court
will refuse confirmation of such plan on the request of such creditor.


-----

Under the WHOA, the court may grant a stay on enforcement of a maximum of four months, with a possible extension of four
months. For the duration of such moratorium, all enforcement action against the assets of (or in the possession of) the debtor
is suspended unless with the court’s approval, including action to enforce security over the assets of the debtor or, in case of
an undisclosed right of pledge over receivables, the collection, or notification to the debtors. Furthermore, any petitions for
bankruptcy in respect of the debtor are suspended and the court may lift attachments on the debtor’s assets at the request of the
debtor or restructuring expert.

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

The Issuer intends to offer the Notes through the Initial Purchasers. The sale will be made pursuant to a purchase agreement
dated on or around the date of this Offering Memorandum (the “Purchase Agreement”) among, _inter alios, the Parent, the_
Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, Barclays Bank PLC as representative of the several Initial Purchasers of the Euro Notes (the
“Euro Representative”) and Barclays Capital Inc. as representative of the several Initial Purchasers of the Dollar Notes (the
“Dollar Representative” and, together with the Euro Representative, the “Representatives”). The Initial Purchasers of the Euro
Notes are Barclays Bank PLC, Coöperatieve Rabobank U.A. trading as Rabobank London, Deutsche Bank AG, London
Branch, Goldman Sachs Bank Europe SE, HSBC Bank plc, ING Bank N.V., London Branch, J.P. Morgan Securities plc, Lloyds
Bank Corporate Markets plc, Merrill Lynch International, Morgan Stanley & Co International PLC, SMBC Nikko Capital
Markets Limited, and UBS AG London Branch and the Initial Purchasers of the Dollar Notes are Barclays Capital Inc.,
Coöperatieve Rabobank U.A. trading as Rabobank London, Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, Goldman Sachs Bank Europe
SE, HSBC Bank plc, ING Bank N.V., London Branch, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets plc,
Merrill Lynch International, Morgan Stanley & Co International PLC, SMBC Nikko Securities America, Inc., and UBS AG

Subject to the terms and conditions contained in the Purchase Agreement, the Issuer has agreed to sell to the Initial Purchasers,
and the Initial Purchasers have agreed severally and not jointly to purchase from the Issuer, the entire principal amount of the
Notes if any of the Notes are purchased. The obligations of the Initial Purchasers under the Purchase Agreement, including
their agreement to purchase the Notes from the Issuer, are several and not joint. In the event that an Initial Purchaser fails or
refuses to purchase the Notes which it has agreed to purchase, the Purchase Agreement provides that the purchase commitments
of the other Initial Purchasers may be increased or that the Purchase Agreement may be terminated.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of the Notes are
subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by counsel.

The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they propose to offer each series of Notes initially at the respective offering price
listed on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum. After the initial offering, the Initial Purchasers may change the offering
price and any other selling terms of the Notes at any time without notice. The Initial Purchasers reserve the right to withdraw,
cancel or modify offers to investors and to reject orders in whole or in part. The Initial Purchasers may offer and sell the Notes
through certain of their affiliates or through registered broker dealers.

To the extent that any Initial Purchaser that is not a U.S. registered broker dealer intends to effect any sales of Notes in the
United States, it will do so through one or more U.S. registered broker dealer affiliates as permitted by guidelines promulgated
by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.

Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and other charges in
accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the offering price set forth on the cover page
hereof.

The Issuer has agreed to pay the Initial Purchasers certain customary fees for their services in connection with this Offering
and to reimburse them for certain out-of-pocket expenses. The Issuer has also agreed to indemnify and hold harmless the Initial
Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, or to contribute to payments that the Initial
Purchasers may be required to make in respect of those liabilities.

We have agreed not to offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of, except as provided under the Purchase Agreement,
any debt securities of, or guaranteed by, the Issuer or any of the Guarantors that are substantially similar to the Notes during
the period from the date of the Purchase Agreement through and including the date falling 30 days after the closing of the
Offering without the prior written consent of the Representatives.

**United States**

Each purchaser of the Notes offered by this Offering Memorandum, in making its purchase, will be deemed to have made
acknowledgments, representations and agreements as described under “Notice to Investors.”

The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold in the United States
unless the Notes are registered under the Securities Act, or an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities
Act is available. Accordingly, each of the Initial Purchasers, severally and not jointly, has agreed that it will not offer or sell
the Notes except (i) to qualified institutional buyers (as defined in Rule 144A) in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities


-----

Act and (ii) to non-U.S. persons (as defined in Regulation S) outside the United States in offshore transactions (as defined in
Regulation S) in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act.

In addition, until the expiration of 40 days after the commencement of this Offering, an offer or sale of Notes within the United
States by a broker/dealer (whether or not participating in this Offering) may violate the registration requirements of the
Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act or pursuant
to another exemption from registration under the Securities Act. For a description of certain further restrictions on resale or
transfer of the Notes, see “Notice to Investors.”

**United Kingdom**

In the Purchase Agreement, each Initial Purchaser, severally and not jointly, has represented and warranted to us that:

(1) it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the Financial Services and Markets Act
2000 with respect to anything done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United
Kingdom; and

(2) it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and it will only communicate or cause to be
communicated any invitation or instrument to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of
Section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000) received by it in connection with the issue or
sale of any Notes in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000
does not apply to us.

This Offering Memorandum is for distribution only to persons who (i) have professional experience in matters relating to
investments (being investment professionals falling within Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000
(Financial Promotion) Order 2005 (as amended, the “Financial Promotion Order”)), (ii) are persons falling within Article
49(2)(a) to (d) (“high net worth companies, unincorporated associations, etc.”) of the Financial Promotion Order, (iii) are
outside the United Kingdom or (iv) are persons to whom an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within
the meaning of section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000) in connection with the issue or sale of any Notes
may otherwise lawfully be communicated or caused to be communicated (all such persons together being referred to as
“relevant persons”). This Offering Memorandum is directed only at relevant persons and must not be acted on or relied on by
persons who are not relevant persons. Any investment or investment activity to which this Offering Memorandum relates is
available only to relevant persons and will be engaged in only with relevant persons. You must not publish, reproduce, distribute
or otherwise make available in whole or in part any part of this Offering Memorandum to any other person. The Notes are not
being offered to the public in the United Kingdom.

**_Prohibition of sales to UK retail investors_**

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made
available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom. For these purposes, a “retail investor” means a person who is one (or
more) of the following: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part
of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as amended, the “EUWA”); (ii) a customer within
the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement the Insurance
Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of
Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (iii) not a qualified investor as
defined in Article 2 of the U.K. Prospectus Regulation. Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation
(EU) No 1286/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “U.K. PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or
selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the U.K. has been prepared and therefore offering or
selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the U.K. may be unlawful under the U.K. PRIIPs
Regulation.

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes in the U.K. will be made pursuant to an
exemption under section 86 of the FSMA from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of Notes. This Offering
Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the U.K. Prospectus Regulation.

**_UK MiFIR Product Governance / Professional Investors and ECPs Only Target Market_**

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the Notes
has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is only eligible counterparties, as defined in the FCA Handbook


-----

Conduct of Business Sourcebook (“COBS”), and professional clients, as defined in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms
part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“UK MiFIR”); and (ii) all channels for
distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering,
selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturer’s target market
assessment; however, a distributor subject to the FCA Handbook Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook
(the “UK MiFIR Product Governance Rules”) is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the
Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturer’s target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution
channels.

**European Economic Area**

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of Notes in any member state of the European
Economic Area (each, a “Member State”) will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the
requirement to produce a prospectus for offers of the Notes. Accordingly, any person making or intending to make any offer
within a Member State of Notes, which are the subject of the offering contemplated in this Offering Memorandum, may only
do so in circumstances in which no obligation arises for the Issuers or the Initial Purchasers to produce a prospectus for such
offer. Neither the Issuers nor the Initial Purchasers have authorized, nor do they authorize, the making of any offer of Notes in
circumstances in which an obligation arises for the Issuers or the Initial Purchasers to publish a prospectus for such offer.
Neither the Issuers nor the Initial Purchasers have authorized, nor do they authorize, the making of any offer of Notes through
any financial intermediary, other than offers made by the Initial Purchasers, which constitute the final placement of Notes
contemplated in this Offering Memorandum. The expression “Prospectus Regulation” means Regulation (EU) 2017/1129.

**_Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors_**

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made
available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a
retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97
(as amended or superseded, the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional
client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Regulation.
Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”)
for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and
therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful
under the PRIIPs Regulation.

**_Professional Investors and ECPs Only Target Market_**

Solely for the purposes of the product approval process of each of the manufacturers, the target market assessment in respect
of the debt securities described in this Offering Memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for such debt
securities is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID
II”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of such debt securities to eligible counterparties and professional clients are
appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending such debt securities (a “distributor”) should take into
consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for
undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of such debt securities (by either adopting or refining the
manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**Belgium**

In the Purchase Agreement, each Initial Purchaser, severally and not jointly, has represented and warranted to us that it has not
advertised an offering of the Notes to any individual in Belgium qualifying as a consumer within the meaning of the Belgian
Code of Economic Law, as amended from time to time (a “Belgian Consumer”) and that it has not offered, sold or resold or
otherwise made available, and will not offer, sell, resell or otherwise make available, the Notes, and that it has not distributed,
and will not distribute, any prospectus, memorandum, information circular, brochure or any similar documents in relation to
the Notes, directly or indirectly, to any Belgian Consumer.

**Canada**

The Notes may be sold only to purchasers purchasing, or deemed to be purchasing, as principal, that are accredited investors,
as defined in National Instrument 45-106 Prospectus Exemptions or subsection 73.3(1) of the Securities Act (Ontario) and are
permitted clients, as defined in National Instrument 31-103 Registration Requirements, Exemptions and Ongoing Registrant


-----

Obligations. Any resale of the Notes must be made in accordance with an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to,
the prospectus requirements of applicable securities laws.

Securities legislation in certain provinces or territories of Canada may provide a purchaser with remedies for rescission or
damages if this Offering Memorandum (including any amendment thereto) contains a misrepresentation, provided that the
remedies for rescission or damages are exercised by the purchaser within the time limit prescribed by the securities legislation
of the purchaser’s province or territory. The purchaser should refer to any applicable provisions of the securities legislation of
the purchaser’s province or territory for particulars of these rights or consult with a legal advisor.

Pursuant to section 3A.3 of National Instrument 33-105 Underwriting Conflicts, or NI 33-105, the underwriters are not required
to comply with the disclosure requirements of NI 33-105 regarding underwriter conflicts of interest in connection with this
offering.

The purchaser confirms its express wish and that it has requested that this document, all documents evidencing or relating to
the sale of the securities described herein and all other related documents be drawn up exclusively in the English language.
_L’acquéreur confirme sa volonté expresse et qu’il a demandé que le présent document, tous les documents attestant de la vente_
_des titres décrits dans le présent document ou s’y rapportant ainsi que tous les autres documents s’y rattachant soient rédigés_
_exclusivement en langue anglaise._

**General**

**_New Issue of Notes_**

The Notes are a new issue of securities with no established trading market. Application will be made to the Authority for the
listing of and permission to deal in the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange. There can be no assurance that the Notes
will be listed on the Official List of the Exchange, that such permission to deal in the Notes will be granted or that such listing
will be maintained.

Certain of the Initial Purchasers have advised us that they presently intend to make a market in the Notes after completion of
this Offering. However, the Initial Purchasers are under no obligation to do so and may discontinue any market making activities
at any time without notice. In addition, any such market making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the Securities
Act and the Exchange Act. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that any market for the Notes will develop, or that it will be
liquid if it does develop, or that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time or at a price which will be favorable to
you, if at all.

**_Price Stabilization and Short Positions_**

In connection with this Offering (other than in circumstances where such action could reasonably be expected to affect the
price of notes or other securities traded in Australia or on a financial market (as defined in the Australian Corporations Act)
operated in Australia), the Stabilization Managers or persons acting on their behalf, may purchase and sell the Euro Notes or
the Dollar Notes, as applicable, in the open market. These transactions may include over-allotment, stabilizing transactions,
syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids. Over-allotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which creates a
short position for the Initial Purchasers. Stabilizing transactions involve bids to purchase the Euro Notes or the Dollar Notes,
as applicable, in the open market for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the Euro Notes or the Dollar
Notes, as applicable.

Syndicate covering transactions involve purchases of the Euro Notes or the Dollar Notes, as applicable, in the open market
after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the Initial Purchasers to reclaim
a selling concession from a broker/dealer when the Euro Notes or the Dollar Notes, as applicable, originally sold by such
broker/dealer are purchased in a stabilizing or covering transaction to cover short positions. These transactions may be effected
in the over the counter market or otherwise.

These activities may stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the market price of the Euro Notes or the Dollar Notes. As a result,
the price of the Euro Notes or the Dollar Notes may be higher than the prices that otherwise might exist in the open market.
Neither we nor the Initial Purchasers make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any effect that
the transactions described above may have on the price of the Euro Notes or the Dollar Notes, as applicable. In addition, there
is no obligation on the Stabilization Managers to engage in such transactions and neither we nor the Initial Purchasers make
any representation that the Stabilization Managers will engage in these transactions or that these transactions, once commenced,
will not be discontinued without notice. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for,
the Notes. Any stabilization action may begin on or after the date on which adequate public disclosure of the terms of this


-----

Offering is made and, if begun, may be discontinued at any time, but it must end no later than the earlier of 30 days after the
Issue Date and 60 days after the date of the allotment of the Notes. Any stabilization action or over allotment must be conducted
by the Stabilization Managers (or persons acting on their behalf) in accordance with all applicable laws and rules.

**_Initial Settlement_**

It is expected that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefor on or around the date specified on the cover
page of this Offering Memorandum, which will be the       business day in the United States following the date of pricing
of the Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as “T+       ”). Under Rule 15(c)6-1 under the Exchange Act, trades
in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly
agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of pricing or the        succeeding U.S.
business days will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes initially will settle in T+      , to specify an alternative
settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such
trades should consult their own adviser.

**_Other Relationships_**

The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which
may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment management, principal
investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates from time
to time have provided in the past and may provide in the future investment banking, financial advisory, operational support and
commercial banking (including hedging) services to the Parent and its subsidiaries, the principal shareholders and their affiliates
in the ordinary course of business, for which they have received or may receive customary fees and commissions. In addition,
in the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of
investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including
bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may
involve securities and/or instruments of the Issuer (including the Notes), the Guarantors or their respective affiliates. The Initial
Purchasers and/or their affiliates may receive allocations of the Notes (subject to customary closing conditions), which could
affect future trading of the Notes. The Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates may, in the future, act as hedge
counterparties to the Parent and its subsidiaries consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, the Initial
Purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of
credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the Notes. Any such short positions
could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment
recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments
and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.

The Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates are agents and/or, as appointed in connection with the Amend and Extend
and Tranche E Term Facilities in relation to the Senior Facilities Agreement (as amended pursuant thereto) physical
bookrunners, joint bookrunners, joint global coordinators and/or lenders under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement,
including the Revolving Credit Facilities and Letters of Credit Facilities, or the Second Lien Credit Facilities Agreement and
may also act as counterparties in hedging arrangements we may enter into in connection with the Financing Transactions.
Barclays Bank PLC also acts as sole physical bookrunner in connection with the Amend and Extend and as sole physical
bookrunner (USD) in connection with the Tranche E Term Facilities. In connection with these financings, the relevant Initial
Purchasers or their respective affiliates have received and will receive customary fees and commissions for their services in
such capacities.

**NOTICE TO INVESTORS**

You are advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any offer, sale, resale, pledge or other transfer of any of the Notes
and/or the Guarantees offered hereby.

The Notes and the Guarantees (together, the “Securities”) have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and
may not be offered or sold in the United States or to U.S. persons unless the Securities are registered under the Securities Act,
or an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and the securities laws of any applicable jurisdiction
is available. Accordingly, the Securities are being offered and sold only (i) to qualified institutional buyers (as defined in Rule
144A, “QIBs”) in reliance on Rule 144A and (ii) to non-U.S. persons (as defined in Regulation S) outside the United States in
an offshore transaction (as defined in Regulation S) in reliance on Regulation S and, if investors are resident in a Member State
of the EEA or the United Kingdom, not retail investors.

We have not registered and will not register the Securities under the Securities Act and, therefore, the Securities may not be
offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons except pursuant to an exemption
from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Accordingly, we are offering and
selling the Securities to the Initial Purchasers for re-offer and resale only:

  - in the United States to QIBs in compliance with Rule 144A; and

  - outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in an offshore transaction in accordance with Regulation S.

We use the terms “U.S. persons,” “offshore transaction” and “United States” with the meanings given to them in Regulation S.

Each purchaser of the Securities hereunder (other than each of the Initial Purchasers) will be deemed to have acknowledged,
represented, warranted and agreed with us and the Initial Purchasers as follows (terms used in this paragraph that are defined
in Rule 144A and Regulation S are used herein as defined therein):

(1) it understands and acknowledges that (i) the Securities have not been registered under the Securities Act or
any other applicable securities laws and that the Securities are being offered for resale in transactions not
requiring registration under the Securities Act or any other securities laws, including sales pursuant to Rule
144A under the Securities Act and (ii) the Securities may not be offered, sold or otherwise transferred except
in compliance with the registration requirements of the Securities Act and in accordance with the Investment
Company Act and any other applicable securities laws or pursuant to an exemption therefrom and in each
case in compliance with the conditions for transfer set forth in paragraphs (4) and (5) below;

(2) it is either (a) a QIB that is aware that any sale of these Securities to it will be made in reliance on Rule 144A
under the Securities Act, and such acquisition will be for its own account or for the account of another QIB;
or (b) a non-U.S. person and is purchasing the Securities outside the United States in an offshore transaction
in accordance with Regulation S;

(3) it acknowledges that neither we nor the Initial Purchasers, nor any person representing us or the Initial
Purchasers, has made any representation to it with respect to us or the offer or sale of any Securities, other
than the information contained in this Offering Memorandum, which Offering Memorandum has been
delivered to it and upon which it is relying in making its investment decision with respect to the Securities.
It has had access to such financial and other information concerning us and the Securities as it has deemed
necessary in connection with its decision to purchase any of the Securities, including an opportunity to ask
questions of, and request information from, us and the Initial Purchasers. It acknowledges that neither the
Initial Purchasers nor any person representing the Initial Purchasers make any representation or warranty as
to the appropriateness, accuracy, adequacy or completeness of this Offering Memorandum;

(4) it is purchasing the Securities for its own account, or for an account with respect to which it exercises sole
investment discretion and for which it is acting as a fiduciary or agent, in each case for investment, and not
with a view to, or for offer or sale in connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of the Securities
Act or any state or other securities laws, subject to any requirement of law that the disposition of its property
or the property of such investor account or accounts be at all times within its or their control and subject to
its or their ability to resell such Securities to a QIB pursuant to Rule 144A or to non-U.S. persons in offshore
transactions pursuant to Regulation S;


-----

(5) it understands and agrees on its own behalf and on behalf of any investor account for which it is purchasing
the Securities, and each subsequent holder of the Securities by its acceptance thereof will be deemed to agree,
that if in the future it decides to resell, pledge or otherwise transfer any Securities or any beneficial interests
in any Securities, it will do so only (i) in the United States to a person it reasonably believes is a QIB that
purchases for its own account or for the account of a QIB to whom notice is given that the transfer is being
made in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act, or (ii) pursuant to offers and sales that occur outside
the United States to non-U.S. persons in compliance with Regulation S, subject in each of the foregoing cases
to compliance with any applicable foreign or state securities laws and any applicable local laws and
regulations, and further subject to our and the Trustee’s rights prior to any such offer, sale or transfer, to
require that a certificate of transfer in the form appearing on the reverse of the security is completed and

### NOTES TO THE CONDENSED UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the six month period ended June 30, 2023

**1. GENERAL INFORMATION AND BASIS OF PREPARATION**

EG Group Limited is a Company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act.
The Company is a private Company limited by shares and is registered in England (Registration number
09826582), and the address of the registered office is Waterside Head Office, Haslingden Road, Blackburn,
Lancashire, BB1 2FA.

The principal activities of the Company and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) are to operate as a convenience store
retailer providing three primary categories of products: Grocery & Merchandise, Foodservice and Fuel, and an
additional category of other services.

The condensed unaudited consolidated interim financial statements (the ‘interim financial statements’) of the
Group have been prepared for the unaudited six month period ended June 30, 2023. Comparative results are
provided for the six months ended 30 June 2022.

The interim financial statements are unaudited, they do not constitute financial statements within the meaning of
Section 434 of the Companies Act 2006, and they do not include all of the information and disclosures required
for full annual financial statements.

The comparative figures for the financial year ended 31 December 2022 are not the company's statutory accounts
for that financial year but are derived from those accounts. Those accounts have been reported on by the
company's auditor and delivered to the registrar of companies. The report of the auditor was (i) unqualified, (ii)
did not include a reference to any matters to which the auditor drew attention by way of emphasis without
qualifying their report, and (iii) did not contain a statement under section 498 (2) or (3) of the Companies Act
2006.

**BASIS OF PREPARATION**

These interim financial statements for the six months ended 30 June 2023 have been prepared in accordance
with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting, under UK adopted international financial standards, and should be read
in conjunction with the Group's Annual report and Financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022.
The Group's auditor reported on those accounts: their report was unqualified, it did not draw attention to any
matters by way of an emphasis, and it did not contain a statement under section 498(2) or (3) of the Companies
Act 2006.

A copy of the statutory accounts for that year has been delivered to the Registrar of Companies. This is available
either on request from the Company’s registered office or to download from: http://www.eg.group.

The interim financial statements are presented in US Dollars rounded to the nearest million.

They are prepared on the historical cost basis, except for financial amounts that are measured at fair values at the
end of each reporting period.

These interim financial statements have been approved by the board on November 2, 2023.

**GOING CONCERN**

The interim financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis as the Directors have a
reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources for a period of at least twelve months from the
date of approval to November 30, 2024 (the ‘going concern assessment period’), having assessed the principal
and emerging risks facing the Group and determined that there are no material uncertainties to disclose. In
determining whether the Group’s financial statements can be prepared on a going concern basis, the Directors
considered the Group’s business activities together with factors likely to affect its financial performance and
liquidity position. These factors included the current macroeconomic landscape with rising interest rates and
inflation, geopolitical factors such as the war in Ukraine and expectations of the future macroeconomic
environment.

The Directors have also considered a number of key factors, including the Group’s business model, strategy,
principal risks and uncertainties and the financial position of the Group, including the current cash position and
available working capital facilities, financial forecasts for a period until November 30, 2024, and the ability to
adhere to the covenants contained within the Group’s financing agreements.

### NOTES TO THE CONDENSED UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the six month period ended June 30, 2023

**1. GENERAL INFORMATION AND BASIS OF PREPARATION CONTINUED**

The Group’s senior debt facilities, as set out in note 13, are subject to a financial covenant measuring net debt to
pre-IFRS 16 EBITDA (leverage), which is tested at the end of each calendar quarter based on the utilisation levels
of the revolving credit facility (“RCF”).

At September 30, 2023, the Group’s net debt position was $8,386m comprising $551m in cash at bank, cash in
transit and on site, and $8,935m of borrowings. In addition, the Group had access to undrawn committed
facilities of $462m giving total available liquidity at that time of $1,013m. The Group’s net debt benefited from
$399m relating to the deferral of indirect tax and duties payable, presented within trade and other payables, with
the balance being repaid over the next 48 months to September 2027.

FORECASTS
The Directors have prepared base and sensitised cash flow forecasts for a period until November 30, 2024, which
indicate that the Group and Company will remain compliant with their covenants and will have sufficient funds
through their existing cash balances and available facilities to meet their liabilities as they fall due for that period,
without any structural changes to the business needed. The forecasts include the effect on trading and financing
cash flows and the reduction in net debt from the disposal of the majority of the UK&I business and the amend
and Extend (“A&E”) of the Group’s terms loans (note 13). No further structural changes to the business are
forecast to be needed.

The Group’s severe but plausible downside scenarios reflect the impact of costs increasing above what can be
passed on through retail prices, where doing so may result in a loss of sales. The principal trading and recovery
assumptions are broadly aligned to those observed in the Group’s historical performance as described above.
Whilst not a key factor in the Directors’ going concern conclusion, the Group does also have other significant
potential mitigations at its disposal to improve its short-term liquidity position and to comply with financial
covenants should the need arise, including scaling back its capital investment programme. As a result of the
uncertainties surrounding the forecasts due to the current macroeconomic climate, the Group has also modelled
a reverse stress test scenario. The reverse stress test models the decline in gross margin and increases in interest
rates that the Group would be able to absorb before requiring additional sources of financing in excess of those
that are available and committed. On the basis of the Group’s resilient trading performance during the current
macroeconomic conditions, and the observed inverse correlation between fuel margins and volumes, the
Directors have considered that the sequence of events leading to this scenario would be considered remote.

The Directors have stated their commitment to reduce net leverage through debt reduction and free cash flow
generation, and have already demonstrated significant progress towards this strategy with the completed sale
and lease back transaction in the US, the non core US asset disposals and the completed sale of the majority of
the UK business on October 31, 2023. These transactions have collectively generated c. $4bn of net proceeds to
be used to repay senior debt – these repayments will be finalised in November 2023, and will facilitate the
completion of the amend and extend of the Group’s term loans which were priced and allocated in June 2023.
Subsequently the maturity of the Group's remaining debt facilities will be $1,211m in February 2025, $1,127m in
October 2025, $671m in April 2027 and $2,321m in February 2028. The Group remains committed to addressing
its remaining near term maturities no later than 12-15 months before their maturity date.

Based on the progression of the refinancing strategy to date, explained above, the Directors are confident that
adequate funding will continue to be available beyond the maturity of the existing facilities. Whilst the Directors
are cognisant of the maturity of these future facilities, the Company have assessed that the appropriate period to
assess going concern is 12 months from the reporting date on the basis that there is a clear refinancing strategy
for these facilities, sufficient time to execute that strategy, and that the purpose of these interim financial
statements is to facilitate that strategy.

CONCLUSION
The Directors anticipate that the group will remain cash generative in the period to November 2024, that funding
requirements at maturity are not expected to increase, and that based on the refinancing strategy, adequate
funding will continue to be available beyond the maturity of the existing facilities. The Directors have therefore
concluded that the degree of uncertainty on refinancing activity is not determined to be significant in order to
affect conclusions relating to the going concern assessment period.

**1. GENERAL INFORMATION AND BASIS OF PREPARATION CONTINUED**

Consequently, the directors are confident that the company will have sufficient funds to continue to meet its
liabilities as they fall due for at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements and
therefore have prepared the financial statements on a going concern basis.

For the six month period ended June 30, 2023

**1. GENERAL INFORMATION AND BASIS OF PREPARATION CONTINUED**

**USE OF ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS**
The preparation of condensed unaudited consolidated interim financial statements requires management to make
judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets
and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical
experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of
which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily
apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

In preparing these condensed unaudited interim condensed consolidated interim financial statements, the
significant judgements made by management in applying the Group’s accounting policies and the key sources of
estimation uncertainty were the same as those that applied to the consolidated financial statements for the year
ended December 31, 2022 with the exception of the judgements exercised in respect to the USA Sales and
leaseback transaction which took place in the period, the disposal of the majority of the Group's UK&I business
and the amend and extend of the Group's term loan facilities.

**USA Sale and leaseback**
On May 15, 2023, the Group entered into a sale and leaseback transaction to sell 414 properties currently
operating under the Cumberland Farms, Fastrac, Sprint, and Tom Thumb banners for gross consideration
approximately $1.5 billion. To facilitate the transaction, a leveraged partnership structure was implemented. The
Group contributed 414 properties to the partnership in exchange for total consideration of $1.5bn, comprising of
cash (c.$1.5bn) and non-cash elements (5% equity holding in the leveraged partnership, valued at $39m). Realty
Income Corporation (“RI”), the indirect purchasers of the properties, hold the remaining 95% equity interest in the
partnership.

In the structure of a sale and leaseback transaction the Group is required to consider whether the transfer of the
properties meet the definition of a sale under both IFRS 16 Leases and IFRS 15 Revenue. To meet the sale criteria,
the Group must transfer control as well as the risks and rewards of ownership of the properties to the purchaser.
If the criteria are not met, the disposal would be considered a ‘failed’ sale and be accounted for as a financing
arrangement rather than a sale and leaseback accounting transaction. The value of the assets remain on the
balance sheet and a corresponding financial liability would be recognised. The Directors have considered the
transaction in two parts when arriving at their conclusion on the accounting treatment for the 414 properties;

  - To view the structure of the transaction as a whole, to assess whether any conditions in the master lease
agreement or the partnership arrangement would create a pervasive conclusion to all properties; and

  - Assessing the site attributes individually, inclusive of considering each site’s economic life and structured
lease payments in meeting standard accounting thresholds when reviewing the risk, reward and control
transfer.

In performing the site level assessment the determination of lease term associated with the sale and leaseback
portfolio was considered. The Directors considered the existing accounting policy which is to assess on a case by
case basis the determination of the lease term, but as a default assumes lease extensions. It was determined that
the non-cancellable period of the leases (18-22 years) and the absence of significant capital outlays at the
inception of the lease (as the Group already occupy the sites) provided a basis such that the reasonable certainty
criteria of extension could not be met. The term of the leases is therefore assumed to be the non-cancellable
period of between 18-22 years. Further detail on this transaction is provided in note 10.

As part of the structural arrangement of the transaction, the Group provided a guarantee with respect to the loan
amount taken by the partnership and also on the subsequent lease payments made by the US business. The
substance of the lease guarantee is such that the Group supports the repayment of the lease payments arising on
the transaction in the instance of a triggering event. A triggering event would be the US business failing to meet
its lease obligations arising. Furthermore, should the partnership default of the loan, the Group acts as guarantor
to the debt itself. The guarantee is accounted for under IFRS 9 as a financial liability designated as fair value
through the profit and loss account. The value of the guarantee is $88m.

In determining the lease liability associated with the resultant leaseback of the portfolio, the incremental
borrowing rate relevant to the US jurisdiction was applied. The rate was determined consistent with Group policy
and updated at the point of the transaction, as at May 15, 2023.

Management determined all sites to be treated as a sale as a result of their assessment.

### NOTES TO THE CONDENSED UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the six month period ended June 30, 2023

**1. GENERAL INFORMATION AND BASIS OF PREPARATION CONTINUED**

**Disposal of UK&I business**
On May 30, 2023 the Group announced that it had agreed to sell the majority of its UK and Ireland fuel,
foodservice and grocery and merchandise business to Asda for a headline consideration of £2.27bn ($2.9bn). The
Group would continue to operate in the USA, Australia, Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and
Belgium, whilst also retaining 32 UK petrol filling stations. The Cooplands bakery business and certain other
foodservice brands will also be retained.

The Directors have considered if the accounting requirements of IFRS 5 have been met which would require the
Group to present the disposal group as Held for Sale. At the balance sheet date, the Directors were comfortable
that the disposal met all of the relevant criteria as per IFRS 5 including that the disposal group was available for
immediate sale in its condition at the time only subject to terms that are usual and customary for sale such as
consents from franchisor partners. There was no contradictory evidence available that impacted the view of the
Directors being able to obtain the franchisor consents in line with the judgments taken at the balance sheet date.
Further information on the held for sale balances is disclosed in note 11.

As a result of commercial discussions, KFC and Starbucks will no longer be part of the UK&I operations disposed
in the transaction with Asda. The Directors considered whether the updated perimeter challenged the
appropriateness of held for sale classification of both the entire perimeter and the KFC/Starbucks assets at the
balance sheet date and have determined that whilst certain assets are to be removed from the perimeter of the
UK&I transaction with Asda, they continue to meet all the criteria under IFRS 5 such that their recognition as Held
for Sale is still appropriate at the balance sheet date. From the date of the held for sale classification, the Board
were committed to sell the businesses within 12 months of the classification date, and EG would seek an
alternative buyer for the businesses of which a number of alternative buyers exist in the market. Further
information on this post balance sheet event can be found in note 17.

Furthermore, the requirements of IFRS 5 ‘Discontinued Operations’ have been considered to determine if the
disposal should be disclosed as such, given that this transaction represents substantially the entire UK&I business.

The Directors are comfortable that, despite this transaction representing a significant portion of the UK&I
business, the disposal does not meet the criteria to be disclosed as a ‘discontinued operation’ as an element of
the business was planned to be retained in the 32 petrol filling stations as well as the evpoint business and other
foodservice businesses including Cooplands. In addition to this, the Directors acknowledge that future investment
is intended to be made within the UK to expand the Group's market presence following the transaction, further
supporting the conclusion that the UK&I business being disposed is not a discontinued operation.

**Amend and Extend of Term loans**
On June 29, 2023 the Group announced the successful allocation of the Amend and Extend (“A&E”) of its terms
loans and also secured an extension to the maturity date of the majority of its revolving credit facilities and letter
of credit facilities to 2027. Of the Group’s existing c.$6.1bn term loan facilities, c.$2.9bn will be repaid through the
proceeds received from the sale and leaseback transaction in the USA and the disposal of the majority of the
UK&I business. The remaining c.$3.2bn of multi-currency term loans have been extended out to February 2028.

The completion of the transaction was thus contingent on the completion of the sale of the majority of the UK&I
business by December 31, 2023.

If this refinancing transaction were not to complete, the retranching and extension of the facilities described in
note 13 would revert to previous terms. Therefore, the Directors considered the likelihood of the disposal not
completing and took the view that the refinancing was deemed to have completed on June 29 2023, as it was
highly probable that the disposal transaction would complete during Q4 2023.

**3. EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS CONTINUED**

**FOR THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30, 2023**

The Group recognised a gross exceptional income of $250m in the period, related taxes on these balances
amounted to $70m. Transaction and acquisition related costs in the period of $19m relate to professional fees
associated with the $1,455m sale and leaseback transaction in the USA which completed in Q2 and the planned
disposal of the majority of the UK&I business expected to complete in Q4 2023.

Exceptional profit on disposal totalling $328m relates to the sale of 414 properties currently operating under the
Cumberland Farms, Fastrac, Sprint, and Tom Thumb banners, as part of the aforementioned sale and leaseback
transaction in the USA. Further detail on this transaction can be found in note 10.

Restructuring costs relate to redundancy payments that were offered to employees with the aim to reduce staff
costs.

In April 2023, the Group committed to sell 19 company operated Minit Mart locations in Missouri and Kansas for
consideration of $21m. In accordance with IFRS 5 ‘Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations’,
the assets and liabilities of the Minit Mart locations have been classified as a disposal group held for sale on the
Group balance sheet. A goodwill impairment of $4m has been recognised as the carrying value of the disposal
group was greater than the fair value less cost to sell of the disposal group.

Exceptional finance costs totalling $54m relates to capitalised finance costs expensed in the period, following the
refinancing of the Group's term loans. This was made up of $31m of capitalised finance costs written off in the
period following the renomination of the Group's existing debt facilities (further information on the
redenomination is outlined in note 13), with a further $23m of costs and fees expensed which were associated
with the amend and extend exercise.

**FOR THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30, 2022**

Transaction and acquisition related costs relate to professional fees associated to historical acquisitions.

Litigation costs relate to legal and professional fees.

Revaluation of unfavourable contract provision relates to a reduction in the provisions recognised in relation to
the contract that the Group entered into with Ampol Limited ("Ampol"). On April 1 2022, the Group resolved it's
Federal Court proceedings with Ampol. In resolving the dispute, the parties agreed updated commercial terms
which resulted in a decrease in the carrying value of the provision by $43m.

For the period ended June 30, 2023, impairment trigger testing for the end of reporting period was performed by
comparing the carrying value of the cash-generating units with their recoverable amount. The recoverable amounts for
cash-generating units have been determined based on their fair value less costs to sell. Management determined that
due to the potential for increased use of alternative fuel vehicles in the long term, it was more appropriate to use fair
value to assess impairment because accounting standards do not permit the inclusion of earnings generated from future
expansionary capital expenditure on the Group’s existing multi-use retail sites in a value-in-use calculation. To determine
these values, the Group used an approach based on forecast adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16 and valuation multiples of
comparable corporations and market transactions ranging from 7.0 times to 12.5 times (2022: 7.0 times to 13.5 times).
The Group’s goodwill impairment assessment is performed at a country level for each group of cash generating units
(“CGUs”). The mid point of the EBITDA valuation multiple range for each group of CGUs is used as the basis for the
calculation of recoverable amount.


-----

### NOTES TO THE CONDENSED UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the six month period ended June 30, 2023

**7. GOODWILL CONTINUED**

The key assumptions in determining fair value relate to forecast EBITDA and the EBITDA valuation multiples used.
Forecast EBITDA has been determined taking into account past experience and includes our expectations of the
maintainable performance of the business based on the current market conditions.

The assessment of the Board determined that the recoverable amount of all the CGUs exceeded their carrying value
using the mid-point of the EBITDA valuation multiples.

- For the France group of CGUs, management reviewed the market multiples of comparable corporations and market
transactions ranged from 8.5 to 10.0 times (2022: 8.5 to 10.0 times). The mid-point EBITDA valuation multiple used of
9.25 times (2022: 9.25) results in the market value being equivalent to the carrying amount. Using an EBITDA multiple
of 8.5 times would result in an impairment of $45m and a multiple of 10.0 times results in total headroom of $45m.
Using the mid-point EBITDA valuation multiple of 9.25x, a reduction in the forecast EBITDA for the France Group of
CGUs would lead to an impairment of the carrying value.

- For the UK&I group of CGUs, management reviewed the market multiples of comparable corporations and market
transactions ranged from 11.0 to 12.0 times (2022: 12.0 to 13.5 times). The movement in the determined multiple range
is due to the revised composition of the remaining UK&I business following the proposed disposal in the period. The
mid-point EBITDA valuation multiple used of 11.5 times (2022: 12.75) results in headroom to the carrying amount of
$4m. Using an EBITDA multiple of 10.75 times would result in an impairment of $12m and a multiple of 12.25 times
results in total headroom of $20m. Using the mid-point EBITDA valuation multiple of 11.5x, a reduction in the forecast
EBITDA of 10% for the UK&I Group of CGUs may lead to an impairment of the carrying value of $21m.

- For the USA group of CGUs, management reviewed the market multiples of comparable corporations and market
transactions ranged from 11.0 to 12.5 times (2022: 11.0 to 12.5 times). The mid-point EBITDA valuation multiple used of
11.75 times (2022: 11.75) results in headroom of $414m. There has been a reduction in the valuation since the year
ended December 31, 2022 driven by the impact of the sale and leaseback transaction on maintainable earnings through
additional rental costs. Using an EBITDA multiple of 11.0 times would result in headroom of $139m and a multiple of 12.5
times results in total headroom of $689m. Using the mid-point EBITDA valuation multiple of 11.75x and a reduction in
the forecast EBITDA of 10% for the USA Group of CGUs may lead to an impairment of the carrying value of $17m.

- For the Australia group of CGUs, market multiples of comparable corporations and market transactions ranged from
7.5 to 8.5 times (2022: 7.5 to 8.5 times). The mid-point EBITDA valuation multiple used of 8.0 times (2022: 8.0) results
in headroom of $13m. Using an EBITDA multiple of 7.25 times would result in an impairment of $59m and a multiple of
8.75 times results in total headroom of $84m. Using the mid-point EBITDA valuation multiple of 8.0x, a reduction in the
forecast EBITDA of 10% for the Australia Group of CGUs may lead to an impairment of the carrying value of $63m.

For the Germany, Benelux and Italy groups of CGUs, no reasonably possible change in managements key valuation
assumptions would lead to an impairment. The table below shows the sensitivity of headroom to changes in the key
assumption. A multiple sensitivity of 0.75 times was used as this represents the mid-point of the largest range across all
group of CGU's.

### NOTES TO THE CONDENSED UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the six month period ended June 30, 2023

**9. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT CONTINUED**

**Impairment methodology**
The Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and right of use assets (see note 10) to determine whether there
is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss or there is a reversal of impairments recognised in
previous years.

Impairment of property plant and equipment and right of use assets
The Group has determined that each site is a separate cash-generating unit for the purpose of impairment testing of
property, plant and equipment and right of use assets. The recoverable amount of the assets are estimated in order to
determine the extent of any impairment losses and reversal of prior impairment losses using the value in use method.

The value in use of each cash generating unit is calculated based on future cash flow estimates. Cash flows are based on
past experience and expectations of future changes in the market, including the prevailing economic climate and global
economy, competitor activity, market dynamics, changing customer behaviours, structural challenges facing fuel and
retail environments and the resilience afforded by the Group’s operational scale. Cash flows are then discounted to
appropriately reflect the time value of money.

Management estimates the discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect the market assessment of the time value of
money and the risks specific to the geographic region to which the cash-generating units relate as at the balance sheet
date.

Key assumptions
The cash flows used within the impairment model are based on assumptions which are sources of estimation uncertainty
and small movements in these assumptions could lead to further impairments.

For value in use calculations, the key assumptions to which the recoverable amounts are most sensitive are discount
rates and future cash flows. The Group has carried out sensitivity analyses to determine what the effect of a change in
these key assumptions on the impairment charge would be.

As there is not a significant risk of an adjustment to the carrying amount of any site level cash-generating unit that
would be material to the Group as a whole, the sensitivity analysis has therefore been considered collectively.

On a calculated total impairment charge of $134m across the Group, sensitising for a pre-tax discount increase of 100
basis points would increase the 2023 impairment charge by $21m.

The Group recognised rental expenses totalling $41m in the six month period ending June 30, 2023 (six month
period ending June 30, 2022: $37m) from short-term leases, leases of low-value assets, variable lease payments
and service costs.

On May 15, 2023, the Group entered into a sale and leaseback transaction to sell 414 properties currently
operating under the Cumberland Farms, Fastrac, Sprint, and Tom Thumb banners for gross consideration of
approximately $1,455m. To facilitate the transaction, a leveraged partnership structure was implemented. The
leveraged partnership included the creation of a new entity, MDC Obsidian Holdings “MDC”, with whom the sale
and leaseback took place. The Group contributed 414 properties to MDC in exchange for cash consideration
($1,455m) and 5% equity holding in the leveraged partnership (valued at $39m). Realty Income Corporation
(“RI”), the indirect purchasers of the properties, hold the remaining 95% equity interest in the partnership. To fulfil
the payment of $1,455m required to purchase the assets from the Group, MDC received a loan of c.$1.2bn from RI
and a contribution of properties also from RI, totaling $464m, in exchange for their equity interest.

The loan from RI to MDC and the subsequent lease payments falling due by the terms of the sale and leaseback
arrangement are both guaranteed by the Group. The substance of the lease payment guarantee is such that
should the lessee not make the lease payments as they fall due and default on those payments, the Group acts as
guarantor. Furthermore, should MDC default on the loan with RI, the Group acts as guarantor to the debt itself.
The debt guarantee is considered to meet the definition of a financial guarantee contract and is classified as a
financial liability on the balance sheet and is currently valued at $88m.

The assets which were sold with a carrying value of $543m were classified as held for sale in the Q1 2023 balance
sheet. A gain of $328m was recognised on completion of the transaction. As part of the structuring of the sale
and leaseback, the taxable gain has been deferred until the properties are sold by MDC. An agreement has been
put in place to ensure that MDC cannot complete any actions that would result in the crystallisation of this gain
for 7 years post completion.

The initial rent arising under the leaseback arrangement is $103m per annum, rising by 2% annually for the
duration of the minimum term on the leases (a range 18-22 years across the portfolio). The Group does have the
option to renew the leases for a further eight terms of 5 years following the initial term. Should the Group choose
to do so, a minimum of 50% of the properties must be renewed at each of the renewal dates.

**11. HELD FOR SALE**

**Non-core locations in the USA**
In December 2022, the Group committed to sell 98 non-core locations in the USA for consideration of $495m. In
accordance with IFRS 5 ‘Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations’, the assets and liabilities
of the locations have been classified as a disposal group held for sale on the Group balance sheet. The disposal
group does not meet the definition of a discontinued operation. No impairment loss has been recognised, as at
the period end it was expected the fair value less costs to sell is in excess of the carrying value of the assets and
liabilities. In the 6 months to June 30, 2023 the Group's agreement to dispose of these properties has been
cancelled, due to the buyer being unable to obtain the required funding. The Directors were still committed to
disposing the locations within twelve months from June 30, 2023 and therefore the disposal group still meets the
requirement to be classified as held for sale. The table below shows the assets and liabilities of the disposal
group.

In April 2023, the Group committed to sell 19 company operated Minit Mart locations in Missouri and Kansas for
consideration of $21m. In accordance with IFRS 5 ‘Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations’,
the assets and liabilities of the Minit Mart locations have been classified as a disposal group held for sale on the
Group balance sheet. The disposal group does not meet the definition of a discontinued operation. An
impairment loss totalling $4m has been recognised prior to reclassification to held for sale as the carrying value
of the disposal group exceeded the fair value less cost to sell. The table below show the assets and liabilities of

**Amend and Extend of Term Loans**
On June 29, 2023 the Group announced the successful allocation of the Amend and Extend (“A&E”) of its terms loans.
Of the Group’s existing c. $6.1bn term loan facilities, c. $2.9bn will be repaid through the proceeds received from the sale
and leaseback transaction in the USA and the disposal of the majority of the UK&I business. The remaining c.$3.2bn of
multi-currency term loans will be extended out to February 2028.

The exercise involved two key steps exercised consecutively:

– Step one involved the redenomination of the Groups existing pound sterling ("GBP") and Australian dollar
terms loans into Euro and US dollar term loans and also some Euro term loans into US dollar term loans, The
redenomination was executed on June 30, 2023. The below table summarises the updated borrowings balances

**13. BORROWINGS CONTINUED**

– Step two involved the splitting of the redenominated term loans into three tranches with differing economic
terms for each tranche. This exercise was executed on June 30, 2023. Summarised below are the relevant terms
attributed to each tranche of term loans:

    - Tranche A represents amounts payable to non-consenting lenders to the amend and extend proposal and
which will continue to remain under existing terms and conditions;

    - Tranche B represents amounts that have been agreed to be repaid by the Group using proceeds from the
sale of the majority of the UK and Ireland business of the Group to Asda and through the execution of the
sale and leaseback transaction in the USA. Until such time that Tranche B amounts are repaid, these continue
to attract interest at existing rates. Under the refinancing terms, Tranche B amounts are to be repaid no later
than December 31, 2023;

    - Tranche C represents amounts that are subject to the A&E programme. Any amounts in Tranche C will attract
new economic terms from June 30, 2023 onwards, including a ticking fee which increased the margin
applicable to Tranche A amounts and transactions fees, until the completion of UK&I transaction. It should be
noted that should the UK&I transaction not complete, any amounts in Tranches B and C will be converted
back into Tranche A i.e. they will revert to the previous terms and conditions; and

    - Tranche D represents new money raised in excess of current exposures under revised economic terms and
revised maturities, being Feb 2028. At the end of the process only one tranche (Tranche D) per currency,
being US$, Euros, GBP and AUD, will exist at revised terms. There are no tranche D borrowings as at June 30,
2023.

As part of the financing process, the Group also secured an extension to the maturity date of the majority of its
revolving credit facilities and letter of credit facilities to 2027. As part of this exercise, the following changes have been
made:

   - Margin over the base rates (for each individual currency) have increased on the RCF facility from 3% to 4% and
on the LC facility from 2% to 3%;

   - Maturity of the facility has been extended from August 2024 to August 2027; and

**Prior to extension** **Post extension**

**$m** **$m**


Revolving credit facilities 469 441

Letter of Credit 734 575

Following the update to the term loans and RCF/LC facilities, $31m of capitalised finance costs were written off in the
period, these were classified as exceptional finance costs in the period. Financing cost totalling $23m which have been
incurred in relation to the amend and extend exercise have also been expensed in the period and classified as
exceptionals.

There are no changes to the terms disclosed in the Group's annual report and financial statements to December 31, 2022
with regard to the secured loan notes, resulting from the amend and extend exercise.

**15. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES**

**Capital commitments**
Capital commitments are due to the acquisition or renewal of new highway stations, concessions and other capital
projects where the Group has an obligation to undertake specified constructions and refurbishment. The commitment as
at June 30, 2023 is $67m (December 31, 2022: $54m, June 30, 2022: $76m).

**Fuel supply contracts**
In the regular course of business, the Group enters into relationships with fuel suppliers whereby the Group commits
itself to purchase certain minimum quantities of fuel in order to benefit from better pricing conditions. The durations of
these contracts range from one to five years. The total volume of these purchase commitments over the remaining
contract duration is 8,475m litres (December 31, 2022: 5,544m litres, June 30, 2022: 8,411m litres). The fuel price at the
time of purchase is not in excess of current market prices and reflects normal business operations.

**16. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS**

**Fair value measurements**
The information set out below provides information about how the Group determines fair values of various financial
assets and financial liabilities.

The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at
fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable:

- Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical
assets or liabilities

- Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that
are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices)

- Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or
liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs)

**17. POST BALANCE SHEET EVENTS**

**Repayment of borrowings**
On 14 July 2023, following the completion of the sale and leaseback transaction in the United States, the Group made
the following repayments to its borrowings:

The Group fully redeemed the 5 year EUR senior secured loan notes of €300m issued on 13 May 2019 repayable on
maturity in 2024. The loan notes carry interest at 3.625% and are secured on the assets of the Group. The principal
repaid was €300m ($326m).

Further to the above repayment, the Group partially redeemed the remaining senior secured loan notes on a pro-rata
basis. The table below outlines the impact of the repayments on the Groups senior secured note liability:

**Held for sale classification - Non-core locations in the USA**
In July 2023, the Group ceased actively marketing the portfolio of 98 non-core locations in the USA due to a change in
the Group's strategy. As such, the disposal group is no longer determined to meet criteria as stipulated under IFRS 5 to
be classified as held for sale. The net assets of the disposal group are $238m and will be reclassified in the Group's
financial statement for the year ended December 31, 2023. No impairment losses were recognised on initial held for sale
recognition in respect of these locations. Please see note 11 for a summary of the financial statement line items that this
will impact on the Groups balance sheet.

**Held for sale classification - USA locations in North Dakota and Montana**
On September 6, 2023, the Group approved the sale of 23 company operated Loaf N Jug Stores in North Dakota and
Montana, USA for consideration of $18m. The sale aligns with the Group’s strategy to strategically divest
underperforming locations and would represent a complete operational exit from these regions. An agreement to
dispose of these locations is expected to be reached in October 2023, with the transaction expected to complete in Q1
2024. The assets and liabilities in relation to these sites will be classified as held for sale from September 2023 and will
be disclosed as such in the Q3 2023 financial report.

**Completion of disposal of sale of the majority of the UK&I business to Asda**
On October 31, 2023, the Group completed the sale of the majority of its UK and Ireland fuel, foodservice, grocery and
merchandise business to Asda for cash consideration of $2.5bn (£2.0bn).

Earlier this year, in May 2023, the Group announced the sale of the majority of its UK and Ireland business for cash
consideration of $2.8bn (£2.27bn). However, following further commercial discussions and finalisation of the deal
perimeter, the parties have agreed that the KFC and Starbucks Foodservice operations will remain with EG Group, and
this is reflected within the final cash consideration.


-----

### NOTES TO THE CONDENSED UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the six month period ended June 30, 2023

**17. POST BALANCE SHEET EVENTS CONTINUED**

The $2.5bn proceeds from this transaction will be used to repay debt and enabling the Group to significantly reduce net
leverage, in line with the recently announced financial policy and deleveraging strategy. These debt repayments will
occur in November 2023 and allow the Group to complete the process to successfully extend the maturity date of the
remaining $3.2bn of its $6.1 billion term loans to February 2028.

**Held for sale classification – UK Starbucks operations**
In October 2023, as a result of the final transaction perimeter for the UK disposal to Asda, the Group ceased actively
marketing the portfolio of its Starbucks franchise operations in the UK. As such, the disposal group is no longer
determined to meet criteria as stipulated under IFRS 5 to be classified as held for sale. The net assets of the disposal
group are $35m and will be reclassified as such at future reporting periods. No impairment losses were recognised on
initial held for sale recognition in respect of these locations.

**32 UK sites and development properties in the UK**
In October 2023, the Group engaged in active discussions regarding the sale of the remaining portfolio of 32 trading
sites and development properties in the United Kingdom to Zuber Issa, a Director of the Group. The net assets in relation
to these sites are $156m. Our Board would only enter into such a transaction on arm’s length commercial terms; while
these terms remain subject to negotiation, the parties are currently considering the valuation multiple underpinning the
UK Disposal to Asda as a relevant and comparable benchmark of enterprise value. The sale remains subject to contract
and financing, and if a deal is entered into and completed, we would expect it to close in the first half of 2024 and to use
the net cash proceeds from the sale to further reduce our senior secured indebtedness. Upon the completion of a sale
to Zuber Issa of the majority of the Retained UK&I Business, Mohsin Issa would then become our sole CEO and would
continue leading our strategy going forward.

**Refinancing announcement**
On October 31, 2023, the Group announced the launch of up to a $500m Term Loan B add-on to existing term loans due
February 2028. Proceeds from the Transaction will be used to partially refinance the remaining 2025 maturities. The
expected terms will be in line with the term loans which were successfully priced and allocated in the Amend and Extend
exercise in June 29, 2023 (see note 12).

### OTHER INFORMATION
Alternative performance measures

**INTRODUCTION**
When assessing and discussing the Group’s reported financial performance, financial position and cash flows,
management makes reference to Alternative Performance Measures (“APMs”) of historical or future financial
performance, financial position or cash flows that are not defined or specified under International Financial Reporting
Standards (“IFRS”).

The APMs used by the Group are financial APMs, usually derived from the financial statements prepared in accordance
with IFRS. Certain financial measures cannot be directly derived from the financial statements as they contain additional
information such as financial estimates. The accounting policies applied when calculating APMs are, where relevant and
unless otherwise stated, substantially the same as those disclosed in the Group’s consolidated financial statements for
the year ended December 31, 2022.

There is no change in APMs compared to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022.
APMs are not uniformly defined by all companies, including those in the Group’s industry, and consequently the APMs
used by the Group may not be comparable with similarly titled measures or disclosures made by other companies. APMs
should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, measures of financial performance, financial position or
cash flows reported in accordance with IFRS.

PURPOSE
The Group uses APMs to aid the comparability of information between reporting periods and business units, either by
adjusting for uncontrollable factors or special items which impact upon IFRS measures, or by aggregating measures, to
aid the users of the Annual Report in understanding the activity taking place across the Group.
Their use is driven by characteristics particularly relevant to the EG Group:

- Adjustments to operating profit – the Group has a significant fixed asset base and consequently incurs a high
proportion of depreciation and amortisation. APMs are used to provide adjusted measures for users of the financial
statements to evaluate our operating performance and our ability to incur and service our indebtedness

- Transactional activity – the Group has made significant acquisitions and disposals in the current and previous
reporting periods. Consequently, a high volume of transaction, restructuring and financing costs are incurred within
the Group which do not reflect its underlying business. APMs are used to provide an adjusted measure for users of the
financial statements to consider performance after such items

- Interest cost – the Group is proportionately highly funded by debt when compared to other businesses in its industry
and/or of similar size. APMs are used to provide an adjusted measure for users of the financial statements to consider
performance before interest costs

- Constant currency - a significant amount of the Group's operations do not have USD as functional currency and
therefore the financial performance of the Group, which is reported in USD, is impacted by the change in exchange
rates. Constant currency performance is calculated by translating performance of non-USD regions using the foreign
exchange rates applicable in the comparative period and allows users to compare the Group's performance on a
consistent basis

- Certain of the Group’s financial covenants are assessed on a fixed GAAP basis under IAS 17. APMs are used for
covenant calculations and to provide information to users of the accounts which is more readily comparable with that
presented in previous periods. Consequently, APMs are used by the Board and management for planning and
reporting. APMs are also referred to in the Group’s covenant calculations and debt facility arrangements. The
measures are also used in discussions with investors in the Group’s secured notes and credit ratings agencies

The non-IFRS measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation, or as an alternative
to, or a substitute for, profit/(loss) for the period or other financial statement data presented in the consolidated
financial statements as indicators of financial performance. Some of the limitations of these non-IFRS measures are that:

- They do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments

- They do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs

- They do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary, to service interest or principal
payments on our debt

- They do not reflect our tax expenses or the cash that may be required to pay our taxes

- They are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our statements of cash flows

- They do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from certain matters we consider not to be indicative
of our ongoing operations

- Although depreciation and amortisation are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortised will often
need to be replaced in the future and EBITDA-based measures do not reflect any cash requirements that would be
required for such replacements

- Some of the exceptional items that we eliminate in calculating certain EBITDA-based measures reflect cash payments
that were made, or will in the future be made

- Other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as
comparative measures

- Certain adjustments made in calculating Adjusted EBITDA, pro forma Adjusted EBITDA and pro forma Adjusted
EBITDA before IFRS 16 contain estimates that management believes reflect the underlying results of operations and
therefore are subjective in nature

#### INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
to the members of EG Group Limited

**OPINION**
We have audited the financial statements of EG Group Limited
(“the Company”) for the year ended 31 December 2022 which
comprise the consolidated income statement, consolidated
statement of comprehensive income, consolidated balance sheet,
consolidated statement of changes in equity, consolidated cash
flow statement, company balance sheet, company statement of
changes in equity and related notes, including the accounting
policies in note 3.

In our opinion:

- The financial statements give a true and fair view of the state
of the Group’s and of the parent Company’s affairs as at
31 December 2022 and of the Group’s loss for the year then
ended

- The Group financial statements have been properly prepared
in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting
standards

- The parent Company financial statements have been properly
prepared in accordance with UK accounting standards,
including FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework

- The financial statements have been prepared in accordance
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006

**Basis for opinion**
We conducted our audit in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law.
Our responsibilities are described below. We have fulfilled our
ethical responsibilities under, and are independent of the Group in
accordance with, UK ethical requirements including the FRC
Ethical Standard, as applied to other entities of public interest.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is a
sufficient and appropriate basis for our opinion.

**Going concern**
The directors have prepared the financial statements on the going
concern basis as they do not intend to liquidate the Group or the
Company or to cease their operations, and as they have
concluded that the Group and the Company’s financial position
means that this is realistic. They have also concluded that there
are no material uncertainties that could have cast significant
doubt over their ability to continue as a going concern from the
date of approval of the financial statements to May 31, 2024
(“the going concern period”).


We used our knowledge of the Group, its industry, and the general
economic environment to identify the inherent risks to its business
model and analysed how those risks might affect the Group’s and
Company’s financial resources or ability to continue operations
over the going concern period. The risk that we considered most
likely to adversely affect the Group’s and Company’s available
financial resources and metrics relevant to debt covenants over
this period was the impact of rising inflation on revenue, margins,
overheads and interest rates

Given the level of financial resources, and the risks inherent in the
cash flows, our evaluation of the directors’ going concern
assessment was of particular significance in our audit.

We considered whether these risks could plausibly affect the
liquidity or covenant compliance in the going concern period by
assessing the directors’ sensitivities over the level of available
financial resources and covenant thresholds indicated by the
Group’s financial forecasts taking account of severe, but plausible
adverse effects that could arise from these risks individually and
collectively.

In our evaluation of the directors’ conclusions, we considered the
inherent risks to the Group’s business model and analysed how
those risks might affect the Group and Company’s financial
resources or ability to continue operations over the going concern
period.

Our conclusions based on this work:

- We consider that the directors’ use of the going concern basis
of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is
appropriate

- We have not identified, and concur with the directors’
assessment that there is not, a material uncertainty related to
events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast
significant doubt on the Group or the Company's ability to
continue as a going concern for the going concern period

However, as we cannot predict all future events or conditions and
as subsequent events may result in outcomes that are inconsistent
with judgements that were reasonable at the time they were
made, the above conclusions are not a guarantee that the Group
or the Company will continue in operation.

#### INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT CONTINUED
to the members of EG Group Limited


**Fraud and breaches of laws and regulations – ability to**
**detect**
Identifying and responding to risks of material misstatement
due to fraud
To identify risks of material misstatement due to fraud (“fraud
risks”) we assessed events or conditions that could indicate an
incentive or pressure to commit fraud or provide an opportunity
to commit fraud. Our risk assessment procedures included:

- Enquiring of directors, the audit and risk committee, group
general counsel and inspection of policy documentation as to
the Group’s high-level policies and procedures to prevent and
detect fraud, including the Group’s channel for
“whistleblowing”, as well as whether they have knowledge of
any actual, suspected or alleged fraud

- Reading Board, audit and risk committee meeting minutes

- Considering the Group’s results against performance targets
and the Group’s remuneration policies

We communicated identified fraud risks throughout the audit
team and remained alert to any indications of fraud throughout
the audit. This included communication from the Group audit team
to full scope component audit teams of relevant fraud risks
identified at the Group level and request to full scope component
audit teams to report to the Group audit team any instances of
fraud that could give rise to a material misstatement at the Group
level.
As required by auditing standards, and taking into account
possible pressures to meet profit targets and our overall
knowledge of the control environment, we perform procedures to
address the risk of management override of controls, in particular
the risk that Group and component management may be in a
position to make inappropriate accounting entries and the risk of
bias in accounting estimates and judgements. On this audit we do
not believe there is a fraud risk related to revenue recognition
because the incentive/pressure and opportunity for management
for fraudulent revenue recognition using a revenue account at a
transactional level is limited. Performance targets and other
pressures on management are focused on EBITDA metrics rather
than revenue metrics and the nature of the operations provide
limited opportunities to engage in fraudulent revenue recognition.

We did not identify any additional fraud risks.

We performed procedures including:

- Identifying journal entries and other adjustments to test for all
full scope components based on risk criteria and comparing the
identified entries to supporting documentation. These included
those posted by users who typically do not create or post
journals, seldom used accounts, journals posted with no account
numbers or little to no description and journals with unusual
descriptions, key words or unexpected entries

- Assessing whether the judgements made in making accounting
estimates are indicative of a potential bias


Identifying and responding to risks of material misstatement
related to compliance with laws and regulations
We identified areas of laws and regulations that could reasonably
be expected to have a material effect on the financial statements
from our general commercial and sector experience through
discussion with the directors and others management (as required
by auditing standards), and from inspection of the Group’s
regulatory and legal correspondence and discussed with the
directors and other management the policies and procedures
regarding compliance with laws and regulations.

We communicated identified laws and regulations throughout our
team and remained alert to any indications of non-compliance
throughout the audit. This included communication from the
Group audit team to full-scope component audit teams of relevant
laws and regulations identified at the Group level, and a request
for full scope component auditors to report to the Group audit
team any instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations
that could give rise to a material misstatement at the Group level.

The potential effect of these laws and regulations on the financial
statements varies considerably.

Firstly, the Group is subject to laws and regulations that directly
affect the financial statements including financial reporting
legislation (including related companies legislation), distributable
profits legislation, and taxation legislation (direct and indirect) and
we assessed the extent of compliance with these laws and
regulations as part of our procedures on the related financial
statement items.

Secondly, the Group is subject to many other laws and regulations
where the consequences of non-compliance could have a material
effect on amounts or disclosures in the financial statements, for
instance through the imposition of fines or litigation or the loss of
the Group’s license to operate. We identified the following areas
as those most likely to have such an effect:

- Relevant regional fuel storage and related environmental
regulations which control spillages arising from delivery,
storage, and sale of fuel products; employee health and safety
and Consumer Rights Legislation, reflecting the Group’s
business model

- Data privacy laws, reflecting the Group’s growing amounts of
personal data held

Auditing standards limit the required audit procedures to identify
non-compliance with these laws and regulations to enquiry of the
directors and other management and inspection of regulatory and
legal correspondence, if any. Therefore if a breach of operational
regulations is not disclosed to us or evident from relevant
correspondence, an audit will not detect that breach.


-----

Context of the ability of the audit to detect fraud or breaches
of law or regulation
Owing to the inherent limitations of an audit, there is an
unavoidable risk that we may not have detected some material
misstatements in the financial statements, even though we have
properly planned and performed our audit in accordance with
auditing standards. For example, the further removed noncompliance with laws and regulations is from the events and
transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely the
inherently limited procedures required by auditing standards
would identify it.

In addition, as with any audit, there remained a higher risk of nondetection of fraud, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery,
intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of
internal controls. Our audit procedures are designed to detect
material misstatement. We are not responsible for preventing noncompliance or fraud and cannot be expected to detect noncompliance with all laws and regulations.

**Other information**
The directors are responsible for the other information, which
comprises the strategic report, directors’ report and the
governance report. Our opinion on the financial statements does
not cover other information and we do not express an audit
opinion thereon.

Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so,
consider whether, based on our financial statements audit work,
the information therein is materially misstated or inconsistent with
the financial statements or our audit knowledge. Based solely on
that work:

- We have not identified material misstatements in the other
information

- In our opinion the information given in those reports for the
financial year is consistent with the financial statements

- In our opinion those reports have been prepared in accordance
with the Companies Act 2006
**Matters on which we are required to report by exception**
Under the Companies Act 2006, we are required to report to you
if, in our opinion:

- Adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent
Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been
received from branches not visited by us

- The parent Company financial statements are not in agreement
with the accounting records and returns

- Certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law
are not made

- We have not received all the information and explanations we
require for our audit

We have nothing to report in these respects.


**Directors’ responsibilities**
As explained more fully in their statement set out on page 82, the
directors are responsible for: the preparation of the financial
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair
view; such internal control as they determine is necessary to
enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; assessing
the Group and parent Company’s ability to continue as a going
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going
concern; and using the going concern basis of accounting
unless they either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent
Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative
but to do so.

**Auditor’s responsibilities**
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements as a whole are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue our
opinion in an auditor’s report. Reasonable assurance is a high level
of assurance, but does not guarantee that an audit conducted in
accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or
error and are considered material if, individually or
in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial
statements.

A fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRC’s
website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.

**The purpose of our audit work and to whom we owe our**
**responsibilities**
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body,
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state
to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state
to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the
fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the
Company’s members, as a body, for our audit work, for this report,
or for the opinions we have formed.

#### NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the year ended December 31, 2022


**1. GENERAL INFORMATION AND BASIS OF PREPARATION**
EG Grou Limited is a company incorporated and domi iled in the
United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006. The Company is
a private company limited by shares and is registered in England
and Wales (registration number 09826582), and the address of
the registered office is Waterside Head Office, Haslington Road,
Guide, Blackburn, Lancashire, United Kingdom, BB1 2FA.

The principal activities of th Group are to perate as a forecourt
retailer providing three primary categories of products: retailing of
Grocery & Merchandise, Foodservice and Fuel and an additional
category of other services.

Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of EG Group Limited have
been prepared for the year ended December 31, 2022 (2021: year
ended December 31, 2021) in accordance with the requirements of
the Companies Act 2006 and UK-adopted International
Accounting Standards. The consolidated financial statements are
presented in US Dollars, generally rounded to the nearest million.
They are prepared on the historical cost basis, except for certain
financial instruments and plan assets of defined benefit pension
schemes that are measured at fair value at the end of each
reporting period, as explained in the accounting policies in note 3.

Going concern
Notwithstanding net current liabilities of $316m (2021: $65m) and
a loss after tax for the year of $322m (2021: profit $54m), the
financial statements have been prepared on the going concern
basis as the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the
Group has adequate resources for a period of at least twelve
months from the date of approval to May 31, 2024 (the ‘going
concern assessment period’), having assessed the principal and
emerging risks facing the Group and determined that there are no
material uncertainties to disclose.

In d termining whether the Group’s financial statements can be
prepared on a going concern basis, the Directors considered the
Group’s business activities together with factors likely to affect its
financial performance and liquidity position. These factors
included the current macroeconomic landscape with rising interest
rates and inflation, geopolitical factors such as the war in Ukraine
and expectations of the future macroeconomic environment.

The Directors have also consider d a number of key factors,
including the Group’s business model, strategy, principal risks and
uncertainties and the financial position of the Group, including the
current cash position and available working capital facilities,
financial forecasts for a period until May 31, 2024, and the ability
to adhere to the covenants contained within the Group’s financing
agreements.

Fu thermore, this review has considered the impact of the
integration of the Group’s acquisition activity. The Group’s senior
debt facilities, as set out in note 22, are subject to a financial
covenant measuring net debt to pre-IFRS 16 EBITDA (leverage),
which is tested at the end of each calendar quarter based on the
utilisation levels of the revolving credit facility (“RCF”).

At Apr l 30, 2023, the Group’s net debt position was $9,820m
comprising $441m in cash at bank, cash in transit and on site, and
$10,261m of borrowings. In addition, the Group had access to
undrawn committed facilities of $312m giving total available
liquidity at that time of $753m. The Group’s net debt benefited
from $426m relating to the deferral of indirect tax and duties
payable, presented within trade and other payables, with the
balance being repaid over the next 53 months to September 2027.


FORECASTS
In addition, the Directors have stated their commitment to
reducing net leverage through debt reduction and free cash flow
generation given the maturity of significant debt facilities in
February 2025 of $7 036m, in October 2025 of $1,381m and in
2026 and 2027 of $1,163m. In March 2023, the Directors
announced a sale and leaseback transaction in the USA generating
gross proceeds of $1.5bn (see note 36) which is expected to
complete in May 2023 and are progressing other strategic options
to reduce leverage to around 4.5x from its leverage at April 2023
of 6.0x as set out in the Corporate Governance section on pages
61 to 82. The Directors anticipate that the group will remain cash
generative in the period to February 2025, that funding
requirements at maturity are not expected to increase, and that
based on the refinancing strategy, adequate funding will continue
to be available beyond the maturity of the existing facilities. The
Directors have therefore concluded that the degree of uncertainty
associated with debt refinancing is not sufficiently significant to
affect the going concern conclusion.

Current macroeconomic factors have had an impact on the Group,
including the impact of inflationary cost increases, driven by
growing commodity prices and rising labour costs. The impact of
inflationary pressures on margins, overheads and general
recession-related risks have been built into the Group's forecast
scenarios.

Consideration was also given to the conflict in Ukraine, which has
continued into 2023 and the subsequent oil price volatility.
Resulting from this, there was significant oil price volatility.
However, as retail prices adapt to wholesale cost movements,
there has been no material adverse impact on the Group’s
profitability. Inflationary pressures are already incorporated into
the overall going concern assessment, and as such the impact of
the conflict in Ukraine does not impact the conclusions reached
over going concern.

Th Directors have prepared base and sensitised cash flow
forecasts for a period until May 31, 2024, which indicate that the
Group and Company will remain compliant with their covenants
and will have sufficient funds through their existing cash balances
and available facilities to meet their liabilities as they fall due for
that period, without any structural changes to the business
needed.

Th Group’s severe but plausible downside scenarios reflect the
impact of costs increasing above what can be passed on through
retail prices, where doing so may result in a loss of sales. The
principal trading and recovery assumptions are broadly aligned to
those observed in the Group’s historical performance as described
above. Whilst not a key factor in the Directors’ going concern
conclusion, the Group does also have other significant potential
mitigations at its disposal to improve its short-term liquidity
position and to comply with financial covenants should the need
arise, including scaling back its capital investment programme.
As a result of the uncertainties surrounding the forecasts due to
the current macroeconomic climate, the Group has also modelled
a reverse stress test scenario. The reverse stress test models the
decline in gross margin that the Group would be able to absorb
before requiring additional sources of financing in excess of those
that are available and committed. On the basis of the Group’s
resilient trading performance during the current macroeconomic
conditions, and the observed inverse correlation between fuel
margins and volumes, the Directors have considered that the
sequence of events leading to this scenario would be considered
remote.


-----

CONCLUSION
Consequently, the directors are confident that the company will have sufficient funds to continue to meet its liabilities as they fall due
for at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements and therefore have prepared the financial statements on a
going concern basis.

The Group’s accounting policies have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial
statements.

#### NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
For the year ended December 31, 2022


**3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED**

Presentational currency continued
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.

Foreign currencies and functional currency
The individual financial statements of each Group subsidiary are
prepared in the currency of the primary economic environment in
which it operates (its functional currency). For the purpose of the
consolidated financial statements, the results and financial
position of the Group are expressed in US Dollars, the
presentational currency for the Group and its consolidated
financial statements.

The assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations are
translated into the Group’s presentational currency at exchange
rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Profits and losses are
translated at average exchange rates for the relevant accounting
period. Exchange differences arising are recognised in the Group
statement of comprehensive income/(loss) and are included in the
Group’s translation reserve.

Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into
the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing on the
date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated into the
functional currency at the rates of exchange at the reporting date.
Exchange differences on monetary items are recognised in the
income statement.

Intragroup loans are translated at the year-end exchange rate
with the resulting exchange differences recognised within
finance costs.

Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of
a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign
entity and translated at the closing rate. Exchange differences
arising are recognised in other comprehensive income.

Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial
statements of the parent Company, EG Group Limited, all entities
controlled by the company (its subsidiaries) and the Group's share
of its interests in joint ventures made up to December 31 each
year. Control is achieved when the Company has the power over
the investee, is exposed, or has rights, to variable return from its
involvement with the investee, and has the ability to use its power
to affect its returns.

SUBSIDIARIES
Subsidiaries are consolidated in the Group’s financial statements
from the date that control commences until the date that control
ceases. Intragroup balances and any unrealised gains and losses or
income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions are
eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.

A list of all the subsidiaries of the Group is included in note 18 of
the Group financial statements. All apply accounting policies
which are consistent with those of the rest of the Group.

JOINT VENTURES AND ASSOCIATES
The Group’s share of the results of joint ventures and associates is
included in the Group income statement and Group statement of
other comprehensive income/(loss) using the equity method of
accounting.

Investments in joint ventures and associates are carried in the
Group balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the
Group’s share of the net assets of the entity, less any impairment
in value.


The carrying values of investments in joint ventures and associates
include acquired goodwill If the Group’s share of losses in a joint
venture or ass ciate equals or xceeds it investment in the in
, the Group does no recognise further losses,
unless it has incurred obligations to do so or made paym nts on
behalf of the joint venture or associates Dividends received from
joint ventur s and associates with nil arrying value are
recognised in the income statement as part of the Group’s share
of post-tax profits/(loss s) of joint ventures and associates

Unrealised gains arising from transactions with joint ventures
are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the entity.
The Group’s interests in joint ventures are de ail d in note 19.

Exceptional items
n addit n to presenting information on an IFRS basis, the Group
also presents an income statement and cash flows from operating
activities that separately identifies exceptional items, including the
impact of related tax as shown in a separate column. This
adjusted information is disclosed to allow an understanding of the
underlying trading performance of the Group and is consistent
with the Group’s internal management reporting. These measures
are used for performance analysis

Exceptional items are those which are separately identified by
virtue of their size or incidence and include, but are not limited to,
acquisition costs, impairment charges, reorganisation costs, profits
and losses on disposal of subsidiaries and other one off items
which meet this definition The Group adopts a minimum threshold
of $1m for the separate identification of exceptional items, which is
applied to the aggregate value over the relevant accounting
periods. The Group exercises judgement in assessing whether
items should be classified as exceptional. This assessment covers
both the nature of the item, cause of occurrence and the scale of
impact of that item on reported performance. Reversals of
previous exceptional items are also classified as exceptional.

Revenue recognition
The Group provides three primary categories of products and
services to its customers: Grocery & Merchandise, Foodservice and
Fuel The Group also provides ancillary se vices such as car
washes lotteries, payzones ATMs etc through its forecourt
operations which are recognised within other sales

Revenue is recognised when the Group has a contract with a
customer and a performance obligation has been satisfied, at
the transaction price allocated to that performance obligation.
The Group does not adjust any of the transaction prices for the
time value of money due to the nature of the Group’s transactions
being completed shortly after the transaction is entered into
with the customer

SALE OF GOODS
Revenue from the sale of fuel and goods in store is recognised
when the transaction is completed in store or at the filling station.

Revenue from fuel sales to authorised dealers is recognised when
the goods are delivered to the specific site location and control
passes.

The transaction price is the value of the goods net of VAT.

Fuel and each good sold in store is considered distinct as it is sold
to customers on a standalone basis The standalone selling price of
fuel and goods is estimated on the basis of the retail price except
for sales to authorised dealers which is determined on the basis of
the wholesale price Discounts are not considered as they are only
given in rare circumstances and are not material


-----

Payment of the transaction price is due immediately when the
customer purchases the fuel at the filling station or takes delivery
of the goods in store. A receivable is recognised by the Group
when the goods are delivered to the authorised dealers as this
represents the point in time at which the right to consideration
becomes unconditional, as only the passage of time is required
before payment is due.

Given the nature of the business and products sold, expected
returns are not considered as they are infrequent and are not
material.

GROSS VERSUS NET PRESENTATION – FUEL DUTY
The treatment of fuel duty is determined by local laws and
regulations as to when the duty becomes legally payable and who
carries the risks and obligations to the tax authorities. In all
markets where fuel duty is applicable to fuel purchases and sales,
the cost of sales and revenues are reported including these duties,
as the Group’s role in the transaction is that of principal.

LOYALTY PROGRAMMES
The Group operates certain customer loyalty programmes where
customers accumulate points for all purchases made, which
entitles them to discounts on future purchases. These loyalty
programmes are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 15.

AGENT V PRINCIPAL – DEALER SITES
Within the Group, there are a number of ‘dealer’ or ‘retailer’
arrangements in place, whereby a third party will be responsible
for some part of the operation of a site.

In line with IFRS 15, when another party is involved in providing
goods or services to a customer, the Group determines whether
the nature of its promise is a performance obligation to provide
the specified goods or services itself (i.e. the Group is acting as
principal) or to arrange for those goods or services to be provided
by the other party (i.e. the Group is an agent). In making this
assessment, a principal is identified as being the party that obtains
control of the assets, which are then transferred to the customer.
When the Group acts as principal, revenue is recognised in respect
of the gross amount of consideration paid by the customer.

When the Group does not control the goods which are
transferred, it acts as an agent and recognises revenue only in the
amount of any fee or commission to which it expects to be
entitled in exchange for arranging for the specified goods or
services to be provided by the other party.

Generally, the Group’s revenue streams from dealer sites fall into
the following broad categories:

- Supply of goods to dealers – the Group acts as a principal in
supplying goods to dealers, transferring control and recognising
revenue at the point of sale to the dealer as the Group is
primarily responsible for fulfilling the order of goods from the
dealers and has the latitude in establishing the price

- Goods sold on consignment from dealer sites – the Group acts
as a principal in selling the goods to end customers as it retains
ownership of goods on consignment until they are sold to an
end consumer and the latitude to establish the price. The Group
recognises revenue in respect of the full sales value to the end
consumer at the point the goods are sold, with commissions
paid to the dealer in respect of the transaction recognised
within cost of sales

- Site rental fees – rental fees earned from dealers on sites are
recognised in other income over the life of the lease in
accordance with IFRS 16


The redemption of points is treated as a separate performance
obligation under IFRS 15, with the transaction price allocated to
issued points with reference to the likelihood of redemption and
the discounts to be given to the customer on redemption of the
points. Revenue from loyalty points is recognised when the
customer redeems the points. Revenue for points that are not
expected to be redeemed is recognised in proportion to the
pattern of rights exercised by customers. A contract liability is
recognised in respect of the price allocated to points which
remain unredeemed and are expected to be exercised by the
customer at year end.

PROVISION OF SERVICES
Revenue from the provision of services such as car washes,
lotteries, payzones, ATMs etc. is recognised when the service is
provided as that is the point in time at which the customer
benefits from the service. Where the Group acts as an agent
selling goods or services, only the commission income is included
within revenue. Payment of the transaction price is usually due
immediately.

COMMERCIAL INCOME
Supplier incentives, rebates and discounts are collectively referred
to as commercial income. Commercial income is recognised as a
deduction from cost of sales on an accruals basis based on the
expected entitlement which has been earned up to the balance
sheet date for each relevant supplier contract.

Amounts due relating to commercial income are recognised within
trade and other receivables, except in cases where the Group
currently has a legally enforceable right of set-off and intends to
offset amounts due from suppliers against amounts owed to those
suppliers, in which case only the net amount receivable or payable
is recognised. Accrued commercial income is recognised within
accrued income when commercial income earned has not been
invoiced at the balance sheet date.

FRANCHISE COSTS
The Group operates a number of brands under franchise
agreements across its jurisdictions. Costs paid to franchise owners
are presented within cost of sales.

FINANCE INCOME AND COSTS
Finance income and costs are recognised in the consolidated
income statement in the year to which it relates using the effective
interest rate method.

Finance income comprises of:

- Interest receivable which is recognised in the consolidated
income statement as it accrues using the effective interest
method

- Foreign exchange gains arising on financing

- Finance income is recognised in the consolidated income
statement in the year in which it occurs

Finance costs comprise of:

- Interest payable which is recognised in the consolidated income
statement as it accrues using the effective interest method

- Foreign exchange losses arising on financing

- Finance costs incurred on finance leases which are recognised
in profit or loss using the effective interest method

- Financing costs of raising debt

For the year ended December 31, 2022


**3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED**
Business combinations and goodwill
The Group accounts for all business combinations by applying the
acquisition method. All acquisition-related costs are expensed as
incurred. On acquisition, the assets (including intangible assets),
liabilities and contingent liabilities of an acquired entity are
measured at their fair value. Non-controlling interest is stated at
the non-controlling interest’s proportion of the fair values of the
assets and liabilities recognised. Where an acquisition of trade and
assets takes place, an assessment is initially made as to whether it
should be accounted under IFRS 3 or not.

Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the
consideration transferred over the net fair value of the Group’s
share of the net assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the
acquired subsidiary, joint venture and the fair value of the
non-controlling interest in the acquiree.

If the consideration is less than the fair value of the Group’s share
of the net assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the
acquired entity (i.e. a discount on acquisition), the difference is
credited to the Group income statement in the period of
acquisition.

At the acquisition date of a subsidiary, goodwill acquired is
recognised as an asset and is allocated to each of the
cash-generating units expected to benefit from the business
combination’s synergies and to the lowest level at which
management monitors the goodwill. Goodwill arising on the
acquisition of joint ventures is included within the carrying
value of the investment.

On disposal of a subsidiary or joint venture, the attributable
amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit
or loss on disposal. On disposal of a cash-generating unit, the
attributable amount of goodwill, calculated on a relative value
basis, is included in the determination of the profit or loss on
disposal. The amount of goodwill allocated to disposals is
calculated using a relative fair value approach.

Where the Group obtains control of a joint venture, the Group’s
previously held interest in the acquired entity is remeasured to its
acquisition date fair value and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is
recognised in the Group income statement.

If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete
by the end of the reporting period in which the combination
occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for
which the accounting is incomplete. Those provisional amounts
are adjusted during the twelve-month measurement period, or
additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect new
information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed
as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the
amounts recognised as of that date.

Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations
Non-current assets (or disposal groups) are classified as assets
held for sale when their carrying amount is to be recovered
principally through a sale transaction and a sale is considered
highly probable. They are stated at the lower of carrying amount
and fair value less costs to sell. Non-current assets (or disposal
groups) that are classified as held for sale are not depreciated.

In accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and
Discontinued Operations, the net results of discontinued
operations are presented separately in the consolidated income
statement (and the comparatives restated) and the assets and
liabilities of these operations are presented separately in the
consolidated balance sheet. Refer to note 8 for further details.


Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less
subsequent depreciation and impairment. Historical cost includes
expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the
assets. Properties in the course of construction are carried at cost,
less any recognised impairment loss.

Cost includes professional fees and, for qualifying assets,
borrowing costs capitalised in accordance with the Group’s
accounting policy.

Depreciation of these assets commences when the assets are
ready for their intended use. Freehold land is not depreciated.

Assets under construction are not depreciated until they are ready
for use and transferred to the appropriate group of assets.

Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation
of assets (other than freehold land and properties under
construction) less their residual values over their useful lives, using
the straight-line method, on the following bases:

Freehold land not depreciated

Buildings 20 to 30 years

Fixtures and fittings 3 to 30 years

The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation
method are reviewed at the end of each reporting year, with the
effect of any changes in estimate accounted for on a prospective
basis.

An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon
disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to
arise from the continued use of the asset. When a decision has
been made to dispose of or scrap an asset in the future, the
remaining useful life is re-evaluated to reflect the period over
which the Group will derive economic benefits from its use.

The gain or loss arising on the disposal or scrappage of an asset is
determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the
carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income
statement.

Impairment of property, plant and equipment
The Group reviews the carrying amounts of its property, plant and
equipment if there are indications that assets might be impaired.
In performing the review, assets are grouped together into the
smallest group of assets that is largely independent of the Group’s
other cash-generating streams. If events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying value of property, plant
and equipment may not be recoverable, the Group determines the
recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of the asset is
estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss
(if any). The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less
costs to sell and value-in-use. In assessing the value-in-use, the
Group considers site performance and development plans (in the
case that there is a plan to knock down and rebuild a site) that
have been established at the balance sheet date. Where there is a
plan to knock down and rebuild a site, the carrying value of the
site is deemed to be the land value and impaired to the extent that
the carrying value of the asset exceeds the land value. Any
impairment loss arising is recognised in the consolidated income
statement.

Fair value is determined as the price that would be received to sell
the cash-generating unit (“CGU”) in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date. To the
extent that the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount,
the asset is impaired and is written down. Any impairment loss
arising is recognised in the consolidated income statement.


-----

Prior impairments of non-financial assets are reviewed for possible
reversal at each reporting date. A previously recognised
impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the
assumptions used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount
since the last impairment loss was recognised. The reversal is
limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed
its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that
would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no
impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Such
reversals are recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Where there is a plan to knock down and rebuild a site, the
carrying value of the site is deemed to be the land value and it is
impaired to the extent that the carrying value of the asset exceeds
the land value. Any impairment loss arising is recognised in the
consolidated income statement.

Intangible assets
Intangible assets, such as trade names, customer relationships and
software, are measured initially at acquisition cost or costs
incurred to develop the asset.

Development expenditure incurred on an individual project is
capitalised only if specific criteria are met, including that the asset
created will generate future economic benefits. Intangible assets
acquired in a business combination are recognised at fair value at
the acquisition date.

Following initial recognition, intangible assets with finite useful
lives are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and
accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation is charged to the
consolidated income statement in administrative expenses on a
straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each asset as
show below.

Trade names 20 years or indefinite in specific
instances

Customer/dealer relationships 10 to 15 years

Other intangible assets 3 to 16 years according to the
estimated life of the asset

In accordance with IAS 38, amortisation methods, useful lives and
residual values are reviewed at each balance sheet date with the
effect of any changes in estimate accounted for on a prospective
basis.

Licence agreements to use cloud software are treated as service
contracts and expensed in the Group income statement, unless
the Group has both a contractual right to take possession of the
software at any time without significant penalty, and the ability to
run the software independently of the host vendor. In such cases
the licence agreement is capitalised as software within intangible
assets. Costs to configure or customise a cloud software licence
are expensed alongside the related service contract in the Group
income statement, unless they create a separately identifiable
resource controlled by the Group, in which case they are
capitalised.

Impairment of non-financial assets
Goodwill and indefinite life brands are not amortised but are
reviewed for impairment at least annually by assessing the
recoverable amount of each cash-generating unit to which the
goodwill relates. The Group allocates goodwill to groups of
cash-generating units, where each country represents a group
of cash-generating units.

The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of
disposal and value-in-use. When the recoverable amount of the
cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount, an
impairment loss is recognised immediately in the Group income


Fair value is determined based on forecast earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (“EBITDA”, which
is a non-IFRS measure) and EBITDA valuation multiples of
comparable corporations and market transactions. For the
purpose of the impairment test, management uses estimates
and assumptions to establish the fair value of the Group’s
cash-generating units. If these assumptions and estimates prove
to be incorrect, the carrying value of the goodwill may be
overstated.

For all other non-financial assets (including intangible assets,
property, plant and equipment and right of use assets) the Group
performs impairment testing where there are indicators of
impairment. If such an indicator exists, the recoverable amount of
the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the
impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash
flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates
the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the
asset belongs.

If the recoverable amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is
less than the carrying amount of the unit, the carrying amount of
the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable
amount. The impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the
carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to
the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying
amount of each asset in the unit.

Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying
amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is increased to the
revised estimate of the recoverable amount, but so that the
increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount
that would have been determined if no impairment loss had been
recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately as a
credit to the consolidated income statement.

Leases
The Group assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease at
inception of the contract. The Group recognises a right of use
asset and a corresponding lease liability with respect to all lease
arrangements in which it is the lessee, except for short-term leases
(defined as leases with a lease term of twelve months or less) and
leases of low-value assets (such as tablets and personal
computers, small items of office furniture and telephones).

For these leases, the Group recognises the lease payments as an
operating expense within distribution costs on a straight-line basis
over the term of the lease unless another systematic basis is more
representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits
from the leased assets are consumed.

LEASE LIABILITIES
Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability
comprise:

- Fixed lease payments (including in-substance fixed payments),
less any lease incentives receivable

- Variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate,
initially measured using the index or rate at the commencement
date

- The amount expected to be payable by the lessee under
residual value guarantees

- The exercise price of purchase options, if the lessee is
reasonably certain to exercise the options

- Payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term
reflects the exercise of an option to terminate the lease

The lease liability is presented as a separate line in the
consolidated balance sheet.

For the year ended December 31, 2022


**3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED**
Leases continued
LEASE LIABILITIES continued
The Group remeasures the lease liability (and makes a
corresponding adjustment to the related right of use asset)
whenever:

- The lease term has changed or there is a change in the
assessment of exercise of a purchase option, in which case the
lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease
payments using a revised discount rate

- The lease payments change due to changes in an index or rate
or a change in expected payment under a guaranteed residual
value, in which case the lease liability is remeasured by
discounting the revised lease payments using the initial discount
rate (unless the lease payment’s change is due to a change in a
floating interest rate, in which case a revised discount rate is
used)

- A lease contract is modified and the lease modification is not
accounted for as a separate lease, in which case the lease
liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease
payments using a revised discount rate. The Group did not
make any such adjustments during the periods presented

The variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a
rate are recognised as an expense within distribution costs in the
period in which the event or condition that triggers the payment
occurs. In calculating the present value of lease payments, the
Group uses the incremental borrowing rate (“IBR”) at the lease
commencement date if the interest rate implicit in the lease is not
readily determinable. As the rate implicit in the lease generally
cannot be readily determined for property leases, the Group uses
incremental borrowing rates, being the rate that the individual
lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain
an asset of similar value to the right of use asset in a similar
economic environment with similar terms, security and conditions.

In order to calculate the IBR for the Group in each territory, a
risk-free rate is obtained, linked to the length of the lease in the
jurisdiction in which the lease is taken, and an adjustment is then
made to reflect credit risk based on the Group’s credit rating.

RIGHT OF USE ASSETS
The Group recognises right of use assets at the commencement
date of the lease (i.e. the date the underlying asset is available for
use). Right of use assets are measured at cost, less any
accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted
for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right of use
assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial
direct costs incurred, restoration costs, and lease payments made
at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives
received.

Whenever the Group incurs an obligation for costs to dismantle
and remove a leased asset, restore the site on which it is located
or restore the underlying asset to the condition required by the
terms and conditions of the lease, a provision is recognised and
measured under IAS 37. To the extent that the costs relate to a
right of use asset, the costs are included in the related right of
use asset.

Unless the Group is reasonably certain to obtain ownership of the
leased asset at the end of the lease term, the recognised right of
use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter
of their estimated useful life and the lease term. Right of use
assets are presented as a separate line in the consolidated balance
sheet and are subject to impairment under IAS 36.


For contracts that contain a lease component and one or more
additional lease or non-lease components, the Group allocates the
consideration in the contract to each lease component on the
basis of the relative standalone price of the lease component and
the aggregate standalone price of the non-lease components.

DETERMINATION OF THE LEASE TERM
Extension and termination options are included in a number of
property and equipment leases across the Group.

In determining the lease term, management considers all facts and
circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise an
extension option, or not exercise a termination option. Extension
options (or periods after termination options) are only included in
the lease term if the lease is reasonably certain to be extended (or
not terminated). This is a subjective assessment made at an
individual lease level, reflecting the facts and circumstances
applicable to each arrangement. Generally, at the commencement
date of property leases, the Group determines the lease term to
be the full term of the lease and the first two periods covered by
extension options (to the extent that these are within the Group’s
control) as the Group is reasonably certain that it will continue in
occupation for the periods covered by these extension options.

In determining whether termination options will be exercised, the
Group makes reference to the economic incentives to not exercise
a termination option for both the Group and the lessor along with
the anticipated costs of termination for both parties.

This assessment is judgemental and reflects the Group’s
expectations at the time of lease inception. Should facts and
circumstances change, the Group may reassess lease terms,
resulting in a remeasurement of lease liabilities and right of use
assets.

The assessment is reviewed if a significant event or a significant
change in circumstances occurs which affects this assessment and
that is within the control of the lessee.

SALE AND LEASEBACK TRANSACTIONS
In a sale and leaseback transaction, the Group transfers control of
an asset to another entity for consideration, and leases that asset
back from the buyer. The Group immediately recognises a lease
liability in respect of the present value of the expected lease
payments. The carrying value of the asset is divided between the
value of the rights retained by the Group (recognised as a lease
asset under IFRS 16) and the rights transferred to the purchaser on
a pro-rata basis based on the respective fair values of the property
and lease payments at the time of sale. Any profit or loss on
disposal is similarly allocated between the retained and
transferred rights, with the portion relating to the buyer’s rights in
the asset being recognised immediately.

Taxation
The tax expense for the year represents the sum of the tax
currently payable and deferred tax. Current and deferred tax are
recognised in profit or loss, except when they relate to items that
are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in
equity, in which case the current and deferred tax are also
recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity
respectively.

Where current tax or deferred tax arises from the initial
accounting for a business combination, the tax effect is included in
the accounting for the business combination.


-----

CURRENT TAX
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on taxable
profit or loss for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as
reported in the income statement because it excludes items of
income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other periods
or items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability
for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.

Tax provisions are recognised for uncertain tax positions where a
risk of an additional tax liability has been identified and it is
probable that the Group will be required to settle that tax.

A provision is made for uncertain tax positions when it is
considered probable that there will be a future outflow of funds to
a tax authority. The provision is calculated using the single best
estimate where that outcome is more likely than not and a
weighted average probability in other circumstances. The position
is reviewed on an ongoing basis, to ensure appropriate provision is
made for each tax jurisdiction. This is assessed on a case-by-case
basis using in-house tax experts, professional firms and previous
experience. See note 14.

DEFERRED TAX
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method,
providing for temporary differences between the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes
and the amounts used for taxation purposes.

Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to
apply in the year when the liability is settled or the asset is realised
based on tax laws and rates that have been enacted or
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is
charged or credited in the income statement, except when it
relates to items charged or credited in other comprehensive
income, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in other
comprehensive income.

Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable
that taxable profits will be available against which deductible
temporary differences can be utilised. The carrying amount of
deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and
reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient
taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to
be recovered. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable
temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, and
interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to
control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable
that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable
future.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally
enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax
liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same
taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax
assets and liabilities on a net basis.

No deferred tax liabilities are recognised for temporary differences
that arise on the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial
recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets
and liabilities in a transaction, that affects neither the taxable
profit nor the accounting profit.


Employee benefits
I) POST-EMPLOYMENT SCHEMES
The Group operates various post-employment schemes, including
both defined benefit and defined contribution plans. For defined
benefit plans, obligations are measured at discounted present
value (using the projected unit credit method) whilst plan assets
are recorded at fair value. The operating and financing costs of
such plans are recognised separately in the Group income
statement; service costs are spread systematically over the
expected service lives of employees and financing costs are
recognised in the periods in which they arise. Actuarial gains and
losses are recognised immediately in the Group consolidated
statement of comprehensive income. Payments to defined
contribution schemes are recognised as an expense as they
fall due.

II) OTHER EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
Some Group companies provide jubilee benefits, rewarding
employees for long years of service. The liability recognised in
the balance sheet is the present value of the obligation at the
reporting date. The jubilee benefits are calculated annually by
independent actuaries.

III) TERMINATION BENEFITS/RESTRUCTURING PROVISION
Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated
by the Group before the normal retirement date, or whenever an
employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these
benefits. Benefits falling due more than twelve months after the
reporting date are discounted to present value. The Group
recognises termination benefits at the earlier of the following
dates:

- When the Group can no longer withdraw the offer of those
benefits

- When the Group recognises costs for a restructuring that is
within the scope of IAS 37 and involves the payment of
termination benefits

Long-term employee benefits are accounted for in the same way
as defined benefit pension benefits with the exception that
remeasurements are recognised immediately through profit or
loss.

A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has
approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the
restructuring either has commenced or has been announced
publicly before the reporting date. Future operating costs are not
provided for.

IV) BONUS PLANS
The Group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses. The
Group recognises an accrual where contractually obliged or where
there is a past practice that has created a constructive obligation.

Inventories
Inventories comprise goods held for resale and are valued at the
lower of cost or net realisable value. The Group applies the
weighted average cost method to value inventories. The cost of
fuel and oil purchased for resale includes all costs incurred in
transporting the goods to their present location. Net realisable
value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of
business, less the cost of selling expenses.

#### NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
For the year ended December 31, 2022


**3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED**
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the
Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the
contractual provisions of the instrument.

FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
Financial assets and liabilities principally consist of trade and other
receivables, accrued income, cash and cash equivalents, trade and
other payables, borrowings and derivative financial assets/
liabilities held at fair value through profit and loss.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents include cash at bank, in hand,
short-term deposits with banks and other financial institutions
with an initial maturity of three months or less, and credit/debit
card receivables, which are settled within 72 hours.

Bank overdrafts are presented as short-term borrowings, and are
reflected as a financing activity in the statement of cash flows.

TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES
Trade receivables are recognised initially at the amount of
consideration that is unconditionally due from customers for
goods sold or services performed in the ordinary course of
business.

The Group holds trade and other receivables with the objective to
collect the contractual cash flows and therefore measures them
subsequently at amortised cost. Loss allowances are recognised
based on expected irrecoverable amounts determined by
reference to past default experience and are adjusted to reflect
current and forward-looking information based on
macroeconomic factors and other factors which affect the ability
of the customers to settle the receivables.

TRADE AND OTHER PAYABLES
Trade and other payables (excluding derivative financial liabilities)
are recorded at cost.

FINANCIAL LIABILITIES AND EQUITY COMPONENTS
Debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial
liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the
contractual arrangement.

An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual
interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its
liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Group are recognised
at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.

FINANCIAL ASSETS
All financial assets are recognised and derecognised on a trade
date where the purchase or sale of a financial asset is under a
contract whose terms require delivery of the financial asset within
the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are
initially measured at fair value, plus directly attributable
transaction costs, except for those financial assets classified as at
fair value through profit or loss, which are initially measured at fair
value. Subsequently, financial assets will be measured at amortised
cost, fair value through other comprehensive income (“FVTOCI”),
or fair value through profit and loss (“FVTPL”), on the basis of
both the Company’s model for managing the assets and the
contractual cash flows associated with them. Where a trade
receivable does not contain a significant financing component
under IFRS 15, it will be measured at its transaction price.


EQUITY INSTRUMENTS
The Group holds investments in unlisted shares that are not traded
in an active market but that are stated at fair value. Fair value is
determined in the manner described in note 34. Where an equity
instrument is not held for trading and does not involve contingent
consideration to which IFRS 3 applies, a determination may be
made on an asset-by-asset basis to recognise gains and losses
arising from changes in fair value in other comprehensive income
or through profit or loss.

Where an election is made to recognise gains and losses arising
from changes in fair value in other comprehensive income, the
cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in the investments
revaluation reserve will remain in this reserve on disposal.

Where this election is not made for an equity instrument, all gains
and losses arising from changes in fair value will be recognised in
the income statement as they arise. Dividends on all equity
instruments are recognised in profit or loss when the Group’s right
to receive the dividends is established.

AMORTISED COST
Financial assets are measured at amortised cost where the asset is
held for the objective of collecting contractual cash flows and the
terms of the asset give rise to cash flows on specific dates that are
solely payments of principal and interest on the amount
outstanding.

The effective interest method is utilised in the calculation of
amortised cost of a debt instrument and for allocating interest
income over the relevant period.

The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts
estimated future cash receipts (including all fees and points paid
or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate,
transaction costs and other premiums or discounts) through the
expected life of the debt instrument, or, where appropriate, a
shorter period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.

Income is recognised on an effective interest basis for debt
instruments other than those financial assets classified as at fair
value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”).

FINANCIAL ASSETS AT FVTOCI
Financial assets are measured at FVTOCI if the asset is held within
a business model for the dual objectives of collecting contractual
cash flows and selling financial assets, and the contractual terms
give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments
of principal and interest on the principal amount.

FINANCIAL ASSETS AT FVTPL
All financial assets which do not meet the criteria for measurement
at amortised cost or FVTOCI are measured at FVTPL. Financial
assets at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any gains or losses
arising on remeasurement recognised in profit or loss. The net
gain or loss recognised in profit or loss incorporates any dividend
or interest earned on the financial asset. Fair value is determined
in the manner described in note 34.

IMPAIRMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS

- At each balance sheet date, financial assets are assessed for
indicators of impairment, considering all reasonable and
supportable information available, including that which is
forward-looking where this is available without undue cost and
effort. If the credit risk on a financial asset has increased
significantly since initial recognition, an impairment equivalent
to the lifetime expected credit losses on the instrument will be
recognised immediately. If the credit risk has not significantly
increased since initial recognition, a loss allowance shall be
measured equivalent to twelve-month expected credit losses


-----

- Loss allowances for trade receivables resulting from
transactions under IFRS 15 will always be measured at an
amount equal to the lifetime expected credit loss (“ECL”)

Lifetime ECLs are the ECLs that result from all possible
default events over the expected life of a financial instrument.
Twelve-month ECLs are the portion of ECLs that result from
default events that are possible within the twelve months after
the reporting date.

ECLs are a probability weighted estimate of credit losses.

For certain categories of financial asset, such as trade receivables,
assets that are assessed not to be impaired individually are, in
addition, assessed for impairment on a collective basis. Objective
evidence of impairment for a portfolio of receivables could include
the Group’s past experience of collecting payments, an increase in
the number of delayed payments in the portfolio past the average
credit period, as well as observable changes in national or local
economic conditions that correlate with default on receivables.

The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the
impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception
of trade receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced
through the use of an allowance account. When a trade receivable
is considered uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance
account.

Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are
credited against the allowance account. Changes in the carrying
amount of the allowance account are recognised in profit or loss.

The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off when
the Group has no reasonable expectations of recovering a
financial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof. However,
financial assets that are written off could still be subject to
enforcement activities in order to comply with the Group’s
procedures for recovery of amounts due.

DERECOGNITION OF FINANCIAL ASSETS
The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the
contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when
it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and
rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity, or when there
is no reasonable expectation of recovering the asset.

On derecognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference
between the asset’s carrying amount and the sum of the
consideration received and receivable and the cumulative gain or
loss that had been recognised in other comprehensive income and
accumulated in equity is recognised in profit or loss, with the
exception of those equity instruments where a determination has
been made to recognise gains and losses arising from changes in
fair value in other comprehensive income.

FINANCIAL GUARANTEE CONTRACT LIABILITIES
Financial guarantee contract liabilities are measured initially at
their fair values and are subsequently measured at the higher of:

- The amount of the loss allowance determined in accordance
with IFRS 9

- The amount initially recognised less, where appropriate, the
cumulative amount of income recognised in accordance with
the Group’s revenue recognition policies


FINANCIAL LIABILITIES
Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities ‘at fair
value through profit or loss’ (“FVTPL”) or ‘other financial liabilities’
carried at amortised cost. Financial liabilities are initially measured
at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs (except
those measured at FVTPL which are initially measured at fair
value).

FINANCIAL LIABILITIES AT FVTPL
Financial liabilities are classified as at FVTPL when the financial
liability is contingent consideration that may be paid by an
acquirer as part of a business combination to which IFRS 3 applies,
or it is designated as at FVTPL. A financial liability will be
designated as FVTPL where this significantly reduces a
measurement inconsistency which would otherwise arise, or where
the group of liabilities (or assets and liabilities as a combined
group) is managed and evaluated on a fair value basis, and
information about the Group is provided on that basis to key
management personnel.

Financial liabilities at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any gains
or losses arising on remeasurement recognised in profit or loss.

The net gain or loss recognised in profit or loss incorporates any
interest paid on the financial liability. Fair value is determined in
the manner described in note 34.

OTHER FINANCIAL LIABILITIES
Other financial liabilities, including interest-bearing bank loans and
credit facilities, are initially measured at fair value, net of
transaction costs. Other financial liabilities are subsequently
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method,
with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis.

The effective interest method is a method of calculating the
amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest
expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the
rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments
through the expected life of the financial liability, or, where
appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount on initial
recognition.

DERECOGNITION OF FINANCIAL LIABILITIES
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when,
the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or have expired.
The difference between the carrying amount of the financial
liability derecognised and the consideration paid and payable is
recognised in profit or loss.

When the Group exchanges with the existing lender one debt
instrument for another one with substantially different terms, such
exchange is accounted for as an extinguishment of the original
financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability.
Similarly, the Group accounts for substantial modification of terms
of an existing liability or part of it as an extinguishment of the
original financial liability and the recognition of a new liability.

It is assumed that the terms are substantially different if the
discounted present value of the cash flows under the new terms,
including any fees paid net of any fees received and discounted
using the original effective rate, is at least 10% different from the
discounted present value of the remaining cash flows of the
original financial liability.

Where the change in terms reflects only a non-substantial
modification, a gain or loss equal to the difference between the
present value of cash flows under the new and the old terms will
be immediately recognised in profit or loss.


-----

#### NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
For the year ended December 31, 2022


**3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED**
Financial instruments continued
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments
to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange rate
risk, including foreign exchange forward contracts and interest
rate swaps. Further details of derivative financial instruments are
disclosed in note 34.

Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a
derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently
remeasured to their fair value at each balance sheet date. The
resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss immediately.

A derivative with a positive fair value is recognised as a financial
asset whereas a derivative with a negative fair value is recognised
as a financial liability. A derivative is presented as a non-current
asset or a non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the
instrument is more than twelve months and it is not expected to
be realised or settled within twelve months. Other derivatives are
presented as current assets or current liabilities.

Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present
obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is
probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation
and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the
obligation. The amount recognised as a provision is the best
estimate of the consideration required to settle the present
obligation at the balance sheet date, taking into account the risks
and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is
measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the present
obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash
flows (when the effect of the time value of money is material)
using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market
assessments of the time value of money. The increase in the
provision due to passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.

When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a
provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, a
receivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that
reimbursement will be received and the amount of the receivable
can be measured reliably.

Where asset retirement obligations (‘dismantling’) and other
asset-related provisions are recorded, a corresponding asset is
recognised which is depreciated over the period for which the
provision relates.

CONTINGENT LIABILITIES ACQUIRED IN A BUSINESS
COMBINATION
Contingent liabilities acquired in a business combination are
initially measured at fair value at the acquisition date, and
recognised as a provision in accordance with IFRS 3 Business
Combinations.


Government grants
Government grants are recognised where there is reasonable
assurance that the grant will be received. Grants that compensate
the Group for expenses incurred are recognised in the income
statement in the relevant financial statement line on a systematic
basis in the periods in which the expenses are recognised, to
present the net expense to the Group.

Share-based compensation
EG Group Holdings Limited, as the ultimate parent company of the
Group, has issued cash-settled shares to the Non-Executive
Directors of the business. Cash-settled share-based payment
transactions are measured at fair value at the date of grant and
remeasured at the end of each reporting period and at the date of
settlement. The fair value is expensed on a straight-line basis over
the expected vesting period, with any changes in fair value
recognised in profit or loss for the period. As the shares awarded
are issued by the ultimate parent Company without charge to the
Company, an amount equivalent to the expense recorded in the
consolidated income statement is recorded as a credit to a capital
contribution reserve.

Fair value is measured using a Monte Carlo simulation pricing
approach in calculating the expected returns to the management
shares. This is seen as an appropriate method for estimating the
value of instruments with growth potential and is based upon
information about the business and forecast performance.


-----

**4. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY**
**SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY**
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are
described in note 3, the Directors are required to make
judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from
other sources.

The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical
experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an
ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised
in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects
only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods
if the revision affects both current and future periods.

Significant judgements in applying the Group’s accounting
policies
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, which
are described above, the Directors have made the following
judgements that have the most significant effect on the amounts
recognised in the financial statements (apart from those involving
estimations, which are dealt with below) and have been identified
as being particularly complex or involve subjective assessments.

EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS
The Directors consider that an adjusted profit measure provides
useful information for the underlying trends, performance and
position of the Group. These measures are consistent with how
business performance is measured internally by the Board.

Profit before exceptionals is not a recognised measure under IFRS
and may not be directly comparable with adjusted measures used
by other companies.

The Directors exercise judgement in determining the items to
classify as exceptional items. This assessment considers the nature
of the item, cause of occurrence and the scale of impact of that
item on reported performance. Reversals of previous exceptional
items are recognised as exceptional items. The Directors exercise
judgement in ensuring there is an equal focus by management in
classifying both expenses and revenue items as exceptional.

The Group’s definition of exceptional items, together with further
details of adjustments made during the period, is provided in note
3 and note 5.

INDEFINITE LIFE BRANDS
The brands of Cumberland Farms and Cooplands are well-known
long-standing brands in the USA and UK&I respectively and as a
result of the reputation and association with quality there is no
foreseeable limit to the period over which the asset is expected to
generate net cash inflows. The brands are therefore deemed to
have an indefinite useful economic life and the values of $337m
and $20m respectively will not be amortised, but will be assessed
for impairment annually. Details of intangible assets are set out in
note 16.

Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources
of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a
significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are
discussed below.


IMPAIRMENT OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND
INTANGIBLES
Property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount may not be recoverable. In performing the review, assets
are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that is
largely independent of the Group’s other cash-generating streams.

Goodwill and indefinite life brands are reviewed for impairment on
an annual basis. The Group allocates goodwill to groups of
cash-generating units, where each country represents a group
of cash-generating units.

When a review for impairment is conducted, the recoverable
amounts for cash-generating units are the higher of fair value less
cost of disposal, and value-in-use. In assessing value-in-use, the
estimated future cash flows (which is a key source of estimation
uncertainty) are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time
value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the
estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.

Fair value is determined based on forecast earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (“EBITDA”, which is
a non-IFRS measure) and EBITDA valuation multiples of
comparable corporations and market transactions. For the
purpose of the impairment test, management uses estimates
and assumptions to establish the fair value of the Group’s
cash-generating units. If these assumptions and estimates prove
to be incorrect, the carrying value of the goodwill may be
overstated.

Other sources of estimation uncertainty
FAIR VALUES IN BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
In assessing the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in
business combinations, estimation is used in a number of areas.
To assist in this work, the Group engages external valuation
experts to assess the fair value. Management then review the work
and assess the results. Details of the fair value of the acquired
assets and liabilities are detailed in note 35.

Measurement of provisions
The Group has recognised provisions totalling $691m (2021:
$839m) for environmental costs, dilapidations and onerous
contracts.

The provision for environmental costs and dilapidations is based
on the current cost escalated at an inflation rate and discounted at
a risk-free rate. The provision for onerous contracts is based on
the lower of our current estimates of cost of fulfilling the contracts
and any compensation or penalties and discounting to present
value when the effect of time value of money is material. These
provisions are estimates and the actual costs and timing of future
cash flows are dependent on future events and market conditions.

Because actual outflows can differ from estimates due to changes
in laws, regulations, prices and conditions, the carrying amounts of
provisions are regularly reviewed and adjusted to take account of
such changes.

Any difference between expectations and the actual future liability
will be accounted for in the period when such determination is
made. The carrying amount of provisions will be impacted by
changes in the discount rate. Details of provisions are set out in
note 27.

#### NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
For the year ended December 31, 2022

**5. EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS**
In order to allow an understanding of the underlying trading performance of the Group, items recognised in reported profit or loss
before tax which, by virtue of their size and/or nature, do not reflect the Group’s underlying performance, are shown as exceptional
items (in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies in note 3). Exceptional items are those which are separately identified by
virtue of their size or incidence and include, but are not limited to, acquisition costs, impairment charges, reorganisation costs, profits
and losses on disposal of subsidiaries, and other one-off items which meet this definition. These items are as follows:

**2022** 2021

**$m** $m

Included within operating profit:

Acquisition and transaction-related costs **(7)** (14)

Litigation costs **(2)** (4)

Contingent consideration release **—** 5

Gain on revaluation of unfavourable contract provision **43** —

Restructuring (costs)/credit **(2)** 2

Profit on disposal **5** 72

Impairment charge **—** (22)

Impairment reversal **1** 7

Goodwill impairment **(100)** (100)

**(62)** (54)

Included within finance costs:

Transaction-related finance costs (see note 37) **—** (41)

Loss on extinguishment of debt on refinancing **—** (15)

**—** (56)

Included within finance income:

Finance income from recharged finance costs (see note 37) **—** 41

**—** 41

Tax on exceptional items **(12)** (6)

**Total exceptional items** **(74)** (75)

All items are shown gross, unless IFRS permits netting of such expenditure.

Tax on exceptional items has been calculated using the applicable statutory tax rate for taxable items.

For the year ended December 31, 2022
Transaction and acquisition-related costs of $7m relate to professional fees associated with the acquisition of the 285 OMV service
stations in Germany which completed on May 1, 2022 and also further costs in relation to historical acquisitions.

Litigation costs of $2m relate to legal and professional fees regarding Federal Court proceedings with Ampol Limited.

Revaluation of unfavourable contract provision of $43m relates to a reduction in the provisions recognised in relation to the contract
that the Group entered into with Ampol Limited ('Ampol'). On April 1, 2022, the Group resolved its Federal Court proceedings with
Ampol. In resolving the dispute, the parties agreed updated commercial terms which resulted in a decrease in the carrying value of
provisions by $43m.

Restructuring costs of $2m relate to legal and professional fees incurred by the Group regarding a project to rationalise inter-company
debt balances.

Profit on disposal of $5m is predominantly in relation to the sale of a number of German sites which were disposed of following the
outcome of the German anti-trust authority's review of the Group's acquisition of the aforementioned OMV sites, resulting in a $3m
profit on disposal. The Group was required to divest a number of petrol filling station sites within six months of the acquisition
completing to address local competition concerns. Additionally, in November 2022, the Group completed the divestment of GB3 Limited
and its parent company Urban Origin Limited, recognising a profit on disposal of $1m.

The impairment reversal of $1m recognised in the year relates to the reversal of a previously recognised exceptional impairment charge,
where operational performance development plans have been implemented and the site level performance was sufficient to support the
increased carrying value.

Following the completion of the goodwill impairment review, an impairment has been recognised in relation to the Australian group of
cash-generating units of $100m. See note 15 for further details.


-----

For the year ended December 31, 2021
Acquisition and transaction-related costs within operating profit of $14m predominantly relate to directly attributable incremental costs
incurred as a result of the Group’s growth acquisitions, and largely relate to professional and legal fees.

Litigation costs relate to legal and professional fees regarding Federal Court proceedings with Ampol Limited.

Contingent consideration release of $5m reflects the release of the contingent consideration relating to the acquisition of Certified Oil,
an acquisition in the USA which completed in 2019, where the criteria for payment were not met.

Exceptional restructuring credit of $2m relates to the release of a provision recognised in 2018 through exceptionals regarding the
restructuring of the management and support teams in Continental Europe.

The profit on disposal in the year is in relation to the sale of a number of UK sites sold following the outcome of the CMA’s review of the
shareholders' acquisition of Asda. The Group was required to divest a number of petrol filling station sites by the end of 2021.

The exceptional impairment charge in the year relates to the $19m intangible impairment of the Tom Thumb brand name, and the $3m
impairment of property, plant and equipment, both in the USA. The impairment reversal of $7m recognised in the year relates to the
reversal of a previously recognised exceptional impairment charge, where operational performance development plans have been
implemented and the site level performance was sufficient to support the increased carrying value.

Following the completion of the goodwill impairment review, an impairment has been recognised in relation to the Australian group of
cash-generating units of $100m. See note 15 for further details.

The transaction-related finance costs relate to the financing costs which were directly incurred in relation to the GBP private placement
notes which were agreed in March 2021 and subsequently redeemed in October 2021. The finance income from recharged finance costs
reflects the reimbursement of these transaction-related finance costs by Bellis Property Newco Ltd, a related party of the Group.
See note 37 for further details.

Following the refinancing of the Group’s revolving credit facility, letter of credit facilities and second lien facilities during the year, the
existing arrangement fees which had been capitalised onto the balance sheet have been expensed in the year. Furthermore, financing
costs were incurred in relation to the GBP private placement notes which were agreed in the year; however, as this facility was
terminated as a result of the aborted Asda forecourt acquisition, these costs were expensed as exceptional.

Threshold
A threshold of $1m is applied in determining the items to classify as exceptional items.

**6. REVENUE**
An analysis of the Group’s revenue is as follows:

**2022** 2021

**$m** $m

**Continuing operations**

Sale of goods

Grocery & Merchandise sales[1] **4,430** 4,484

Foodservice sales[1] **1,280** 1,062

Fuel sales **24,422** 20,346

Other sales **484** 528

**Revenue per income statement** **30,616** 26,420

1 From January 1, 2022 the Group elected to reclassify its presentation of certain items reported in the USA and Europe from Grocery &
Merchandise to Foodservice. The equivalent values for 2021 have been restated, with an increase of $122m (USA: $64m, Europe: $58m) to
Foodservice revenue, and a corresponding decrease in Grocery & Merchandise. There is no impact of this presentation change on the total
revenue, gross profit, operating profit or profit after tax.

Revenue from the provision of services includes dealer and franchise revenues, commissions received for ancillary services and car wash
revenues, and is presented within other sales. Also included within other sales are $264m (2021: $366m) of Grocery & Merchandise stock
sales to dealers in Europe, where the Group facilitates the sale and purchase of dry stock between a wholesale supplier and our portfolio
of dealers.

**As at December 31, 2022**
At December 31, 2022, $378m of assets and $85m of liabilities are presented as held for sale.

Non-core locations in the USA
In December 2022, the Group committed to sell 98 non-core locations in the USA. In accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held
for Sale and Discontinued Operations, the assets and liabilities of the locations have been classified as a disposal group held for sale on
the Group balance sheet. The disposal group does not meet the definition of a discontinued operation. No impairment loss has been
recognised, as at the year end it was expected the fair value less costs to sell is in excess of the carrying value of the assets and
liabilities. The table below shows the assets and liabilities of the disposal group.

**Total tax charge for the year** **(64)** (153)

The current tax rate used for the year is 19%, based on rates already enacted in previous periods.

For the United Kingdom operations, the Finance Act 2021 included legislation to increase the UK’s main corporation tax rate from 19% to
25%, which is due to be effective from April 1, 2023. The change to the main rate of corporation tax was substantively enacted by the
balance sheet date and therefore included in these financial statements. Deferred tax has been calculated using these rates based on the
timing of when each individual deferred tax balance is expected to reverse in the future.

For the US, in August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act was introduced. This Act implements a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax
("CAMT") on companies with a global 3-year average adjusted financial statement income ("AFSI") of more than $1.0 billion. We are
awaiting the final legislation and detailed guidance to assess the full implications upon EG Group, however the Group does not believe
the provisions of this Act would apply.

For the Netherlands, on December 20, 2022 the Dutch Senate accepted the Dutch Tax Plan 2023. In 2022, the corporate income tax rate
for profits up to €395,000 will be taxed at 15% and profits beyond €395,000 ($467,216) will be taxed at 25.8%. For 2023, the rates
remain the same but the threshold reduces from €395,000 to €200,000. These rates were substantively enacted by the balance sheet
date and therefore included in these consolidated financial statements.

For Belgium, on July 26, 2017 the Belgian Federal government reached an agreement on an important corporate tax reform to gradually
reduce the corporate income tax rate. The standard rate has been reduced in steps from 29% to 25% in 2022. These rate reductions
were substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and therefore included in these consolidated financial statements.

On September 27, 2017 the French government released the French finance bill for 2018 in which they announced a gradual reduction in
the headline rate of corporate income tax from 31%, to 27.5% in 2021 (for companies with turnover exceeding €250m) and finally 25% in
2022 and 2023. The 3.3% social surcharge will continue to apply for corporate tax liabilities exceeding €763,000, bringing the 25%
standard rate in 2022 to an effective rate of 25.8%. These rate reductions were substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and
therefore included in these consolidated financial statements.

Deferred tax has been calculated using these rates based on the timing of when each individual deferred tax balance is expected to
reverse in the future.

#### NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
For the year ended December 31, 2022

**14. TAX CONTINUED**
In December 2021, the OECD issued model rules for a new global minimum tax framework and the UK has announced the intention to
bring these into effect from December 31, 2023. Whilst the overarching framework has been published, we are awaiting the legislation
and detailed guidance to assess the full implications upon EG Group. At the date when the financial statements were authorised for
issue, none of the jurisdictions in which the Group operates had enacted or substantively enacted the tax legislation related to the Pillar
Two tax, however the IASB have released guidance to suggest IAS 12 will be amended, effective for periods beginning January 1, 2023
where entities will not need to recognise deferred tax impacts of top up tax or remeasure existing deferred taxes to reflect top up tax
rate. The final amendments to IAS12 in this respect are expected end of May 2023.

The effect of interest restriction represents the impact of the UK Corporate Interest Restriction rules (effective from April 1, 2017), the
Dutch ATAD 1 interest restriction rules (effective from January 1, 2020) and the USA s163j interest limitation rules (effective from
January 1, 2019), which restrict the amount of interest that can be deducted for tax purposes with reference to a proportion of the
profits of an entity or group.

No material amounts relating to tax have been recognised in other comprehensive income during the year (2021: no material amounts).

Uncertain tax positions
The Group is subject to taxation in several jurisdictions and by nature subject to scrutiny from multiple tax authorities. The complexity of
applicable rules may result in legitimate differences of interpretation between the Group and taxing authorities, especially where
economic judgement or valuation is involved. When these different interpretations arise, the Group recognises these differences under
IFRIC 23. At December 31, 2022, the Group held uncertain tax provisions of $35m (2021: $15m).

#### NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
For the year ended December 31, 2022

**15. GOODWILL CONTINUED**

The assessment of the Board determined that, following the recognition of an impairment of $100m (2021: $100m) in respect of
Australia noted below, the recoverable amount of all the CGUs exceeded their carrying value using the mid-point of the EBITDA
valuation multiples.

- For the France group of CGUs, management reviewed the market multiples of comparable corporations and market transactions
ranged from 8.5 to 10.0 times (2021: 9.0 to 10.5 times). The mid-point EBITDA valuation multiple used of 9.25 times (2021: 9.75) results
in headroom of $45m. Using an EBITDA multiple of 8.5 times would result in an impairment of $1m and a multiple of 10.0 times results
in total headroom of $91m. Using the mid-point EBITDA valuation multiple of 9.25x, a reduction in the forecast EBITDA of 9% (2021: a
reduction of 26%) for the France Group of CGUs may lead to an impairment of the carrying value. The breakeven EBITDA valuation
multiple for the France group of CGUs is 8.4 times

- For the Australia group of CGUs, market multiples of comparable corporations and market transactions ranged from 7.5 to 8.5 times
(2021: 7.5 to 9.0 times). The mid-point EBITDA valuation multiple used of 8.0 times results in an impairment of $90m. This impairment
would be $141m at the low end EBITDA multiple of 7.5 times and $39m at the high end multiple of 8.5 times. The breakeven EBITDA
valuation multiple for the Australia group of CGUs is 9.0 times. Using the mid-point EBITDA valuation multiple to support our
conclusion, an impairment charge of $100m (2021: $100m) has been recognised and presented as an exceptional item for the Australia
group of CGUs for the year ended December 31, 2022, The impairment has been generated from both the reduction in the forecast
EBITDA and the reduction in the mid-point multiples versus the prior year.
In 2021, for the Benelux group of CGUs, the mid-point EBITDA valuation multiple used of 9.75 times resulted in headroom of $43m, an
EBITDA multiple of 9.0 times would have led to an impairment of $42m and a multiple of 10.5 times resulted in total headroom of $128m.
In 2021, a reduction in the forecast EBITDA of 5% for Benelux would have led to an impairment of the carrying value of the group of
CGUs. Due to an increase in both the actual and forecast EBITDA for Benelux for the year ended December 31, 2022, no reasonably
possible change in managements key valuation assumptions would lead to an impairment. The breakeven EBITDA valuation multiple for
the Benelux group of CGUs is 7.44 times (2021: 9.26 times).

For the USA, UK&I, Germany, Benelux and Italy groups of CGUs, no reasonably possible change in managements key valuation
assumptions would lead to an impairment. The table below shows the sensitivity of headroom to changes in the key assumptions, after
the $100m impairment in Australia for 2022.

Of the total amortisation expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 of $90m (2021: $87m), $65m (2021: $56m) has been charged
to administrative expenses and $26m (2021: $31m) to distribution costs.

The trade name additions of $79m in 2021 reflect the fair value attributable to trade names acquired in the UK as part of the LEON
($53m) and Cooplands ($23m) acquisitions and in the USA ($3m) from the Sprint acquisition.

During 2021, a Board decision was taken to rebrand a majority of the Tom Thumb stores in the USA to Cumberland Farms over 24
months, meaning there is a significant reduction of the expected use of the Tom Thumb trade name. At January 1, 2021, the Tom Thumb

Cooplands trade name
The brand name for Cooplands ($20m at December 31, 2022, $23m at December 31, 2021) has been deemed to have an indefinite
economic life based on management's assessment that it will generate net cash inflows indefinitely. Cooplands was founded in 1885 and
therefore the trade name has been used for over 135 years. Management expect the Company to use the trade name into the
foreseeable future and, as a result, it will not be amortised, but tested for impairment at least annually.

For the year ended December 31, 2022 an impairment review was performed by comparing the carrying value of the trade name and
recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of the asset was determined by calculating the higher of fair value less costs of disposal
and value-in-use. The recoverable amount of the trade name was determined based on its value-in-use. The key estimates are the
discount rate, growth rate and the royalty rate.

Management estimate discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect the current market assessment of the time value of money and the
risks specific to the cash-generating units. The pre-tax discount rate used was derived from a post-tax weighted average cost of capital
for Cooplands, 12.77%.

Revenue projections for Cooplands' non-fuel offerings have been generated based on the Group’s forecast through to 2025. The
forecasts incorporated annualised growth ranging from (5.2%) to 6.0%. The long–term growth rate incorporated in the forecast beyond
2025 was 2.6%.

Based on a search of licence agreements for similar trade names and the consideration of the profitability of Cooplands, a royalty rate of
2.5% was utilised to value the trade name at the point of acquisition and is also used to determine the recoverable amount of the trade
name as at the year end.

Management has performed sensitivity analysis on the reasonably possible changes in key assumptions in the impairment tests of the
Cooplands brand name. An increase in the discount rate of 0.1% and a decrease in the growth rate of 0.1% may result in an impairment.

Cumberland Farms trade name
The Cumberland Farms trade name ($337m at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021) has an indefinite economic life based on
management’s assessment that it will generate net cash inflows indefinitely. The trade name has been used in the marketplace for over
80 years and management expect the Company to use the trade name into the foreseeable future. As a result, the trade name is not
amortised, but is tested for impairment at least annually.

For the year ended December 31, 2022 an impairment review was performed by comparing the carrying value of the trade name and
recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of the asset was determined by calculating the higher of fair value less costs of disposal
and value-in-use. The recoverable amount of the trade name was determined based on its value-in-use. The key estimates are the
discount rate, growth rate and the royalty rate.

Management estimate discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect the current market assessment of the time value of money and the
risks specific to the cash-generating units. The pre-tax discount rate used was derived from a post-tax weighted average cost of capital
for the USA group of CGUs, 8.85% (2021: 8.2%).

Revenue projections for Cumberland Farms' non-fuel offerings have been generated based on the Group’s forecast through to 2028.
The forecasts incorporated annualised growth of 3% (2021: 1.2% to 3.0%) in the forecast period to reflect the continuing trend towards
convenience retail offset by declines in volumes due to the knock-on impact from a decline in fuel volumes. The long–term growth rate
incorporated in the forecast beyond 2028 was 3% (2021: 1.3%).

Based on a search of licence agreements for similar trade names and the consideration of the profitability of Cumberland Farms, a
royalty rate of 2% was utilised to value the trade name at the point of acquisition and is also used to determine the recoverable amount


-----

Management has performed sensitivity analysis on the reasonably possible changes in key assumptions in the impairment tests of the
Cumberland Farms brand name. Neither a reasonably possible one percentage point increase in discount rates nor a one percentage
point decrease in non-fuel revenues would indicate an impairment of the brand name.

#### NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
For the year ended December 31, 2022

**17. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT CONTINUED**
The carrying amount of land and buildings shown above includes $1,155m (2021: $1,114m) in relation to land that is not depreciated.

Of the total depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 of $464m (2021: $515m), $2m (2021: $3m) has been charged to
cost of sales, $5m (2021: $58m) has been charged to administrative expenses and $456m (2021: $454m) to distribution costs.

Impairment methodology
The Group reviews on an annual basis the carrying amounts of its tangible and right of use assets (see note 24) to determine whether
there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss or there is a reversal of impairments recognised in previous
years.

Impairment of property plant and equipment and right of use assets

The Group has determined that each site is a separate cash-generating unit for the purpose of impairment testing of property, plant and
equipment and right of use assets. The recoverable amount of the assets are estimated in order to determine the extent of any
impairment losses and reversal of prior impairment losses.

The value in use of each cash generating unit is calculated based on future cash flow estimates. Cash flows are based on past experience
and expectations of future changes in the market, including the prevailing economic climate and global economy, competitor activity,
market dynamics, changing customer behaviours, structural challenges facing fuel and retail environments and the resilience afforded by
the Group’s operational scale. Cash flows are then discounted to appropriately reflect the time value of money.

Management estimates the discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect the market assessment of the time value of money and the
risks specific to the geographic region to which the cash-generating units relate as at the balance sheet date.

Key assumptions and sensitivity

The cash flows used within the impairment model are based on assumptions which are sources of estimation uncertainty and small
movements in these assumptions could lead to further impairments.

For value in use calculations, the key assumptions to which the recoverable amounts are most sensitive are discount rates and future
cash flows. The Group has carried out sensitivity analyses to determine what the effect of a change in these key assumptions on the
impairment charge would be.

As there is not a significant risk of an adjustment to the carrying amount of any site level cash-generating unit that would be material to
the Group as a whole, the sensitivity analysis has therefore been considered collectively.

On a calculated total impairment charge of $290m across the Group, sensitising for a pre-tax discount increase of 100 basis points
would increase the 2022 impairment charge by $18.4m. Sensitising for a reduction of future cash flows aligned with the “reasonable
worst case scenario” that the Group considered as part of its going concern review, would increase the 2022 impairment charge
by $68.8m.

Assets pledged as security
Freehold land and buildings with a carrying amount of $3,025m (2021: $3,219m) have been pledged to secure borrowings of the Group
(see note 22).

-----

Trade receivables are recognised initially at the amount of consideration that is unconditionally due from customers in the ordinary
course of business. The Group holds trade receivables with the objective to collect the contractual cash flows and therefore measures
trade receivables subsequently at amortised cost. Trade and other receivables are generally non-interest-bearing. Credit terms vary by
country and the nature of the debt.

Trade and other receivables include $12m (2021: $7m) within prepayments of amounts due from suppliers in relation to commercial
income which has been earned but not yet invoiced.

Allowances against doubtful debts are recognised based on expected irrecoverable amounts determined by reference to past default
experience and are adjusted to reflect current and forward-looking information based on macroeconomic factors and other factors
which affect the ability of the customers to settle the receivables.

The ageing analysis of trade receivables and the provision for impairment of trade receivables is as follows:

**0-30 days** **31-60 days** **61-90 days** **Over 90 days**

Expected credit loss rate —% —% —% —% 40% 3%

**Provision for impairment of trade receivables** — — — — (12) (12)

As at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, trade receivables that were neither past due nor impaired related to a receivable for
whom there is no recent history of default and therefore the expected credit loss rate applied resulted in an immaterial allowance
against doubtful debts. The other classes of receivables do not contain impaired assets and the expected credit loss rate applied to
these receivables results in an allowance against doubtful debts of less than $1m.

At December 31, 2022, trade and other receivables of $22m (2021: $31m) were past due and impaired. Movement in the allowance for
doubtful debts:

**$m** $m

Deferred tax liabilities **(493)** (517)

The Group offsets certain deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities related to the same taxation authority, in accordance with the
accounting policy for deferred tax described in note 3 to the financial statements.


-----

At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of $1,371m (2021: $1,319m) and excess interest capacity of $469m (2021:
$174m) available for offset against future profits.

A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of $794m (2021: $815m) of losses and $399m (2021: $174m) in respect of excess
interest capacity. The losses recognised are those which have arisen in the current period in entities in the UK, and losses brought
forward in the head of the German fiscal group and the USA (including various state and local jurisdictions on a post-apportioned basis
for 2022 and 2021) which are expected to have future taxable profits against which these losses can be offset, and losses brought
forward in Belgian entities which are utilising their brought-forward losses each year. The deferred tax asset on excess interest capacity
relates to interest restrictions in the UK, USA and Netherlands.

**Unrecognised deferred tax assets**
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining $578m (2021: $504m) of losses or $70m (2021: $nil) of excess
interest capacity. There is deferred tax unrecognised on losses of $65m (2021: $60m) in the UK, Luxembourg, Netherlands and Germany
as there are restrictions in place which restrict the utilisation of these losses, and deferred tax unrecognised on losses of $513m (2021:
$444m) in Belgium and the USA as it is not considered probable there will be future taxable profits against which these losses will be
utilised.

Of the $513m (2021: $444m) of tax losses unrecognised mentioned above, $349m (2021: $308m) are USA various state and local
jurisdictions which are recognised at a lower blended rate of 4.97% (2021: 5.54%), on a post-apportioned basis.

The deferred tax asset unrecognised on excess interest capacity relates to interest restrictions in the UK and USA.

No deferred tax liabilities have been recorded with respect to investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures as any unremitted earnings
may be repatriated tax free.

**$m** $m

Fixed payments **(1)** (19)

Variable payments **(70)** (52)

**Total payments** **(71)** (71)

The total cash outflows for leases amount to $331m (2021: $341m).

Lease payments are presented as follows in the Group statement of cash flows:

- short-term lease payments, payment of leases of low-value assets and variable lease payments not included in the measurement of
lease liability are presented within cash flows from operating activities

- payments for interest and principal element of recognised lease liabilities are included within cash flows from financing activities.

During 2021, the Group entered into the sale-and-leaseback of a number of sites. The assets relating to these sites were sold for $42m
and had a net book value of $29m. A gain of $1m was recognised in the year with the remaining gain of $12m deferred as a reduction to
the right of use asset relating to the leaseback.

The Group does not have any restrictions or covenants imposed by leases.

On February 27, 2023 the Group agreed the sale and leaseback of a portfolio of 416 sites across Cumberland Farms, Fastrac, Tom

Property provisions (December 31, 2022: $395m; 2021: $438m)
Property provisions comprise asset retirement obligation provisions, environmental provisions for remediation works at petrol filling
stations (“PFS”), debranding provisions and dilapidation provisions. The nature of the provisions and the judgements applied in
determining the amount to be provided are described in further detail below:

**• Asset retirement obligation (‘dismantling’) (December 31, 2022: $285m; 2021: $302m)**
Dismantling provisions relate to sites for which the Group only has a right to operate the site for a number of years under a lease
arrangement with a third party. After the right to use has expired, the Group is obliged to dismantle all assets on the specific site and
to restore the site to its original condition. Amounts provided are based on prior experience of costs incurred. The provision is
expected to be utilised in the medium to long term.

**• Environmental restoration (December 31, 2022: $77m; 2021: $97m)**
Environmental protection requirements for remediation works at petrol filling stations (“PFS”) vary by country and are regulated by
different agencies in each country. In all countries, a provision is made in full when a liability is identified and assessed. A provision is
recognised for the present value of costs to be incurred for the restoration of sites, based on third-party reports. The provision is
expected to be utilised in the medium to long term.

**• Debranding (December 31, 2022: $7m; 2021: $10m)**
Debranding provisions relate to sites where, on termination of existing contracts with fuel suppliers and brand licensors, the Group is
obliged to debrand, at its own cost, sites and motorway concessions. Amounts provided are based on prior experience of costs
incurred. The provision is expected to be utilised in the medium to long term.

**• Dilapidations (December 31, 2022: $27m; 2021: $29m)**
Dilapidation provisions relate to sites acquired on leases which contain clauses under which the Group has to make good dilapidations
or other damage which occurs to the property during the course of the lease or restore the property to a specified condition.
Amounts provided are based on prior experience of costs incurred. The provision is expected to be utilised in the medium to long
term.

The Group is expecting total reimbursements of $23m to be received in future in respect to these provisions and therefore, an asset
totalling $23m has been recognised in respect to this.

**Unfavourable contracts (December 31, 2022: $184m; 2021: $261m)**
The amount provided represents unfavourable contracts acquired through business combinations in which the business was committed
to a contract with less favourable cash inflows/outflows than those which could have been obtained in an equivalent contract
negotiated at arm’s length as at the date of acquisition. Amounts provided for relate to the difference between the estimated fair value
of the contract at acquisition date and the estimated fair value of an equivalent contract negotiated on the acquisition date. The
provision is expected to be utilised in the medium to long term. During the year, the Group resolved their Federal Court proceedings
with Ampol Limited. In resolving the dispute, the parties agreed updated commercial terms, which has resulted in a decrease in the
carrying value of provisions by $43m.

**Other provisions (December 31, 2022: $112m; 2021: $140m)**
Other provisions relate primarily to legal claims, restructuring costs, onerous contracts and obligations to retailers/dealers who operate
sites in the Group. The nature of the provisions and the judgements applied in determining the amount to be provided are described in
further detail below:

**• Legal claims (December 31, 2022: $11m; 2021: $24m)**
The amount provided primarily represents several legal claims brought against the Group (i) by retailers, wholesalers, suppliers and
sub-lessees for wrongful termination of contracts and/or alleged contractual breach, or (ii) by landlords for an amendment of the
rent, or (iii) by customers and employees claiming for injury or damages. Based on prior experience with such claims, the expected
settlement date is uncertain and can extend for several years. Amounts provided for are based on estimated outcomes of the claims
determined by internal and external legal counsel. The provision is expected to be utilised in the medium to long term.

**• Retailer/dealer contract premiums (December 31, 2022: $18m; 2021: $22m)**
The Group provides for expected outflows to reflect the accumulated rights of the retailer/dealer. In certain jurisdictions, where the
Group has an arrangement for a third-party retailer/dealer to operate a site, the third party is legally or contractually entitled to
certain benefits relating to the length of their service. The Group provides for the expected outflows arising from this obligation on
the basis of the award accumulated at the reporting date. The provision is expected to be utilised in the medium to long term.

**• Other (December 31, 2022: $83m; 2021: $94m)**
The Group has a number of other smaller provisions which make up this total balance. This balance includes items such as expected
costs for the Group’s committed restructuring activity, insurance excess reserves and real estate transfer taxes. The largest provision
within Other relates to insurance excess reserves totalling $53m (2021: $59m)

The Group is expecting total reimbursements of $3m to be received in future in respect to these provisions and therefore, an asset
totalling $3m (2021: $3m) has been recognised in respect to this.

**32. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES**
Capital commitments
Capital commitments are due to the acquisition or renewal of new highway stations, concessions and other capital projects where the
Group has an obligation to undertake specified constructions and refurbishment. The commitment as at December 31, 2022 is $54m
(2021: $90m).

Fuel supply contracts
In the regular course of business, the Group enters into relationships with fuel suppliers whereby the Group commits itself to purchase
certain minimum quantities of fuel in order to benefit from better pricing conditions. The durations of these contracts range from one to
five years. The total volume of these purchase commitments over the remaining contract duration is 5,544m litres (2021: 11,774m litres).
The fuel price at the time of purchase is not in excess of current market prices and reflects normal business operations.

Contingent liabilities
The Group recognises provisions for liabilities when it is more likely than not that a settlement will be required and the value of such a
payment can be reliably estimated. On review of ongoing matters at the reporting date, management have concluded that all such
claims other than those that are provided for are remote, and accordingly contingent liabilities have not been recognised. Contingent
liabilities identified through business combinations are recognised on the balance sheet as provisions in accordance with IFRS 3.

Subsidiary audit exemptions
The following wholly owned subsidiary undertakings, consolidated into the EG Group Limited financial statements for the year ended
December 31, 2022, are exempt from the requirements for the audit of individual accounts by virtue of Section 479a of the Companies
Act 2006 in England. Information on the countries of incorporation, registered offices and principal activities are detailed in note 18.

#### NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
For the year ended December 31, 2022

**33. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS**
The Group operates a variety of post-employment benefit arrangements, covering both funded defined benefit schemes and funded
defined contribution schemes. These benefits have been valued in conformity with IAS 19 and in accordance with the Group accounting
policies described in note 3.

The table below outlines where the Group’s post-employment amounts and activity are included in the financial statements:

**2022** 2021

**$m** $m

**Balance sheet obligations for:**

Defined benefit plan **(16)** (29)

Jubilee premium plan **(3)** (3)

Liability in the balance sheet **(39)** (56)

**Income statement charge:**

Defined benefit plan **1** (7)

Defined contribution plan **(37)** (29)

**(36)** (36)

Defined contribution schemes
The Group operates defined contribution retirement benefit schemes for all qualifying employees. The only obligation of the Group with
respect to the retirement benefit scheme is to make the specified contributions.

Other employee benefits
The Group provides long service awards and jubilee benefits, rewarding employees for long years of service. The liability recognised in
the consolidated balance sheet represents the present value of the obligation at the reporting date.

Defined benefit schemes
Following the acquisition of EFR in November 2016 and Echo Tankstellen GmbH and Retail Operating Company GmbH in October 2018,
the Group now operates the following long-term employee benefit plans for its working and retired personnel: retirement benefit plan,
jubilee benefits for long years of service and bridge pension plan for employment terminated before the normal retirement date.

The Group operates five defined benefit plans (2021: five one for employees in Belgium, three for employees in the Netherlands and one
for employees in Germany. Employee contributions are required regarding the defined benefit plan.

In Belgium the defined benefit plan is subject to Belgian law and is insured by AG Insurance. The pension plan is an annuity plan, which
also provides an option for a lump sum payment at the retirement age based on the average salary. These arrangements are typical in
the Belgian market. The plan in Belgium is funded. If the plan assets are below the legal minimum funding requirement, the employer is
obliged to make an immediate contribution to the plan. The legal requirement is based on a 6% interest rate and the mortality table. The
investments are governed by the insurer, who oversees all investment decisions.

In the Netherlands, the defined benefit plans are subject to Dutch law and are insured by Aegon Levensverzekering N.V. and NationaleNederlanden Levensverzekering Maatschappij N.V. One of the defined benefit plans is a final pay plan, which provides benefits to
members in the form of annuities based on final salary. The other defined benefit plans are average pay plans, which provide benefits to
members in the form of annuities based on average salary. The annuity arrangements are typical in the Dutch market and are required
by Dutch law. After retirement or withdrawal, pensions are indexed conditionally with inflation. All of the plans in the Netherlands are
funded. The plan assets are governed by the insurer, who also bears the risks and responsibility of the plan assets – overseeing all
investment decisions and guaranteeing the accrued benefits in the case of a deficit position of the scheme.

The risks of the Group in the Netherlands are limited to pension increases and transfer of value. In Belgium an additional risk for the
Group arises if the plan assets are below the legal minimum funding requirement. This requirement does not exist for the Group’s plans
in the Netherlands. In Germany, as the plans are unfunded, the Group bears the risks of longevity, future salary increases, inflation
(pension increases) and interest risk.

In Germany, the defined benefit plan is unfunded. Members are eligible to receive life-long benefit payments in case of death, disability
and when reaching normal retirement age. The amount of benefits depends mainly on the length of service and final salary of the plan
members, while the exact details of the pension benefits vary based on the employee’s date of hire. Benefit payments will be paid
directly from the Company.


-----

The schemes typically expose the Group to the following actuarial risks:

Investment risk The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate determined by reference to
high-quality corporate bond yields; if the return on plan asset is below this rate, it will create a plan deficit.

Interest risk A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the plan liability but this will be partially offset by an increase in
the return on the plan’s debt investments.

Longevity risk The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the best estimate of the mortality
of plan participants both during and after their employment. An increase in the life expectancy of the plan
participants will increase the plan’s liability.

Salary risk The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of plan
participants. As such, an increase in the salary of the plan participants will increase the plan’s liability.

The most recent full actuarial valuations of the plan assets and the present value of the defined benefit liabilities in Belgium, the
Netherlands and Germany were carried out at December 31, 2022 by Mercer. The present value of the defined benefit liability, and the
related current service cost and past service cost, were measured using the projected unit credit method.

The average duration of the defined benefit obligations at the end of the reporting year is 17.7 years (2021: 21.6 years) relating to active,
deferred and retired members.

The Group expects to make a contribution of $nil (2021: $nil) to the defined benefit schemes during the next financial year. There has
been no change in the processes used by the Group to manage its risks from prior years.

Sensitivity analyses
Significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit obligation are discount rate and expected salary increase.
The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the respective assumptions occurring at
the end of the reporting year, while holding all other assumptions constant.

The sensitivity analysis may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that the changes
in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated. In presenting the above
sensitivity analysis, the present value of the defined benefit obligation has been calculated using the projected unit credit method at the
end of the reporting year, which is the same as that applied in calculating the defined benefit obligation liability recognised in the
balance sheet. There was no change in the methods and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis from prior periods.

If the discount rate was 25bps higher/(lower) the defined benefit obligation would decrease/(increase) by $0.8m/($0.7m).

If the expected salary growth increases/(decreases) by 0.25%, the defined benefit obligation would (increase)/decrease by ($0.1m)/
$0.1m.

Loans to related parties classified at FVTPL as at December 31, 2022 relates to a convertible loan provided by the Group to a related
party. The loan is convertible at a discount to the Group and carries zero interest. The instrument terminates in August 2024. The loan is
included in loans to related parties within cash flows from investing activities.

External debt instrument receivable classified at amortised cost at December 31, 2021 had cash interest rates at a margin of 4.25% (plus
LIBOR) and a payment-in-kind margin of 3.75% An additional $1m of interest income was accrued in 2022. The debt instrument was
repaid in full on January 13, 2022 with $11m of interest received presented within cash flows from investing activities and the principal
element of $231m presented within cash flows from investing activities.

Significant accounting policies
Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted (including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and
the bases for recognition of income and expenses) for each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed
in note 3.

Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the
return to shareholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance and sustaining the future development of the business.

The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt (borrowings disclosed in notes 22 and 31 after deducting cash and bank
balances) and equity of the Group (comprising issued capital, share premium and other reserves as disclosed in notes 28 to 30). The
Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.

The Board can manage the Group’s capital structure by diversifying the debt portfolio, recycling capital through sale and leaseback
transactions and flexing capital expenditure. Part of the Group’s capital risk management is to monitor a broad range of financial metrics
and ensure compliance with the general covenants included in the Group’s various borrowing facilities. There have been no breaches of
financial covenants in the financial years ended December 31, 2022 or December 31, 2021.

Leverage
Leverage at the year end is as follows:

**2022** 2021

**$m** $m

Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16 **1,602** 1,585

Net debt before lease liabilities **(9,679)** (9,601)

**Leverage** **6.0** 6.1

Adjustments to net debt per financial covenant calculation **617** 885

Adjusted net debt **(9,062)** (8,716)

**Covenant leverage** **5.7** 5.5

Leverage is calculated as the Group’s net debt before lease liabilities (as defined on page 148), adjusted for certain items set out in the
Group's senior facilities agreement (predominantly differences in foreign exchange rates and unamortised debt costs), divided by the
Group’s pro forma Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16 (as defined on page 148).

Covenant leverage is calculated as Group senior net debt (i.e. the Group's net debt excluding second lien facilities) before lease liabilities
adjusted for certain items set out in the Group's senior facilities agreement (predominantly unamortised debt costs and accrued
interest), divided by the Group's pro forma Adjusted EBITDA before IFRS 16 (as defined on page 148).

Financial risk management objectives
Risks facing the Group include market risk (including foreign currency risk and interest rate risk), credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow
interest rate risk.

The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential
adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance. The objective is to identify, quantify, manage and then monitor events or actions
that could lead to financial losses. The Group occasionally seeks to minimise the effects of these risks by using derivative financial
instruments (interest rate swaps or forward exchange contracts) to hedge certain risk exposures.

The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.

Market risk
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates (see
below). The Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency
risk, including:

 - Forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on purchase of fuel in US Dollars by European
subsidiaries

 - Interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates

The Group has not applied cash flow hedge accounting on forward foreign exchange contracts.

There has been no change to the Group’s exposure to market risks or the manner in which these risks are managed and measured.

Foreign currency risk management
The Group’s exposure to foreign currency risk is as follows. Amounts represent balances carried in non-functional currencies by Group
entities. This is based on the carrying amount for monetary financial instruments except derivatives, when it is based on notional
amounts:

**Euro** **US Dollar** **GBP** **AUD** **Total**

Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
The Group is mainly exposed to the Euro in relation to the servicing of Euro-denominated debt held by subsidiaries with a GBP
functional currency and the servicing of US Dollar-denominated debt held by subsidiaries with a GBP functional currency.

The following table details the Group’s sensitivity to a 10% increase and decrease in GBP against the Euro and the GBP against the US
Dollar. 10% represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates. The sensitivity analysis
includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the year end for a 10% change
in foreign currency rates. The sensitivity analysis includes external loans as well as loans to foreign operations within the Group where
the denomination of the loan is in a currency other than the currency of the lender or the borrower. A positive number below indicates
an increase in profit and other equity where the functional currency strengthens 10% against the relevant foreign currency. For a 10%
weakening of the functional currency against the relevant foreign currency, there would be a comparable impact on the profit and other
equity, and the balances below would be negative.

**$m** $m **$m** $m

EUR:GBP **266** 369 **266** 369

USD:GBP **(124)** (140) **—** —

In management’s opinion, a change in exchange rate of 10% of US Dollars against GBP, Euro or Australian Dollars would be offset
against the foreign currency translation within equity. The table above therefore does not show the impact of the translation of foreign
subsidiaries into presentational currency. A 10% change in US Dollars against GBP at year end would have an impact of $22m on equity,
a 10% change in US Dollars against Euro at year end would have an impact of $12m on equity, and a 10% change in US Dollars against
Australian Dollars at year end would have an impact of $89m on equity.

Interest rate risk management
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk because entities in the Group borrow funds at floating interest rates. Hedging activities are
evaluated regularly to align with interest rate views and a defined risk appetite, ensuring the most cost-effective hedging strategies are
applied.

Interest rate swap contracts
Under interest rate swap contracts, the Group exchanged the difference between fixed and floating rate interest amounts calculated on
agreed notional principal amounts. Such contracts enabled the Group to mitigate the earnings and cash flow risk of changing interest
rates on the variable rate debt held. The fair value of interest rate swaps at the reporting date was determined by discounting the future
cash flows using the curves at the reporting date and the credit risk inherent in the contract and is disclosed below. The average interest
rate was based on the outstanding balances at the end of the financial year.

The following tables detail the notional principal amounts and remaining terms of interest rate swap contracts outstanding as at the
reporting date:

OUTSTANDING RECEIVE FLOATING PAY FIXED CONTRACTS

Less than 1 year **—** 5.5 **—** 20 **—** (1)

— 20 — (1)

The interest rate swaps settled on a quarterly basis. The floating rate on the interest rate swaps is three months LIBOR/EURIBOR.

The Group would settle the difference between the fixed and floating interest rate on a net basis.


-----

INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
The sensitivity analysis has been determined based on the interest rate exposure for both derivative and non-derivative instruments at
the balance sheet date. For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared on the assumption that the liability outstanding at the
balance sheet date was outstanding for the full year. A 100 basis point increase or decrease represents management’s assessment of a
reasonably possible change in interest rates. If interest rates had been 100 basis points higher/lower and all other variables were held
constant, the Group’s profit and other equity for the year would be impacted as follows:

Income statement Equity

**2022** 2021 **2022** 2021

**$m** $m **$m** $m

Variable rate borrowings **+/-70** +/-53 **+/-70** +/-53

**+/-70** +/-53 **+/-70** +/-53

Credit risk management
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. Credit
risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, deposits with banks and financial institutions, derivatives in an asset position, as well as credit
exposures to wholesale and retail customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions. Sales to retail customers
are settled in cash or using major credit cards. The Group has unsecured trade and other receivables of $768m (2021: $639m) and cash
and cash equivalents of $466m (2021: $646m), reflecting its maximum exposure to credit risk. These receivables are normally settled
when due and are spread across a number of counterparties so the likelihood of material losses arising as a result of this exposure is
considered insignificant for the reasons set out below.

The Group’s trade receivable balances comprise a number of individually small amounts from unrelated customers, over a number of
geographical areas. Concentration of risk is therefore limited.

The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties and obtaining sufficient collateral where appropriate,
as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults. The Group’s exposure and the credit ratings of its counterparties, taking
into account the financial position of customers, past experience and other factors, are continuously monitored.

The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk. The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited
because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.

Liquidity risk management
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which has established an appropriate liquidity risk
management framework for the management of the Group’s short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management
requirements. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities, by
continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows, and by matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.

Details of additional undrawn facilities that the Group has at its disposal to further reduce liquidity risk are set out on the following page.

Fair value measurements
The information set out below provides information about how the Group determines fair values of various financial assets and financial
liabilities.

The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value,
grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable:

- Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities

- Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable
for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices)

- Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not
based on observable market data (unobservable inputs)

**39. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS**
Share purchase plan (cash-settled)
In June 2021, EG Group Limited's parent Company, EG Group Holdings Limited issued non-voting redeemable fixed return management
shares in EG Group Holdings Limited to Non-Executive Directors employed by EG Group Holdings Limited. A total of six management
shares have been issued at a nominal value of £178,571 per share, with the return tied to the growth in the equity value of the Group,
subject to certain return hurdles.

The shares entitle the holders to a return upon an exit event such as a sale or IPO.

The maximum payment on vesting of the awards is capped at 50 times the initial subscription price.

Measurement of fair values
The fair value of the share purchase plan has been measured using a Monte Carlo simulation approach to calculate the expected returns
to the management shares.

The inputs used in the measurement of the fair values at grant date of the cash-settled share-based payment plans were as follows.

**Share purchase plan**

**2022** 2021

Expected volatility **30.0%** 32.5%

Expected life **2.5 years** 3.5 years

Dividend yield **0.0%** 0.0%

Risk-free interest rate **4.32%** 1.12%

The result of the valuation exercise performed has determined that the aggregate fair value of the management shares under IFRS 2 is
$0.3m (2021: $6.1m) as at December 31, 2022.

The volatility assumption is based on the average annualised historic equity value volatility of comparable companies over a period
equal to the exit period.

The vesting period represents management’s best estimate of the expected period between the issue of the contract and vesting of the
benefit. Management expectation is that the timeframe to achieve an exit event is four years from the grant date. This is an area of
judgement and management continue to assess the appropriateness of this estimate at each reporting date.

Amount recognised in profit and loss
As the Directors provide their services in the context of the governance of the Group as a whole, management has concluded that the
majority of the services are provided to the Group Company. As a result, an income/expense is recorded to the income statement of the
Group Company. A credit has been recognised in 2022 as the fair value of the management shares is lower than the amount expensed in
previous years.

For further details of the related employee benefit expense, see note 11.

#### NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the year ended December 31, 2022

**1. GENERAL INFORMATION**
The principal activity of EG Group Limited (the ‘Company’) is as a holding company. The Company is incorporated and domiciled in the
United Kingdom. The Company is a private company limited by shares and is registered in England and Wales, and the address of the
registered office is Waterside Head Office, Haslingden Road, Guide, Blackburn, Lancashire, BB1 2FA, United Kingdom.

**2. BASIS OF PREPARATION**
The separate financial statements of the Company have been prepared on the historical cost basis, in accordance with Financial
Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework (“FRS 101”) and are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006.

The Company meets the definition of a qualifying entity under FRS 100 Application of Financial Reporting Requirements as issued by
the Financial Reporting Council.

As permitted by FRS 101, the Company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available under that standard in relation to
financial instruments, capital management, presentation of comparative information in respect of certain assets, presentation of a cash
flow statement, standards not yet effective, impairment of assets and related party transactions. Where relevant, equivalent disclosures
have been given in the Group accounts.

The Company’s financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling, its functional currency, rounded to the nearest million.

The Directors have taken advantage of the exemption available under Section 408 of the Companies Act and not presented an income
statement or a statement of comprehensive income for the Company alone.

**3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES**
Basis of accounting
The principal accounting policies adopted are the same as those set out in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements except as
noted below.

Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less, where appropriate, provisions for impairment.

Financial guarantees of subsidiary obligations
The Company has provided financial guarantees in respect of the borrowings of certain subsidiaries. These are accounted for under IFRS
4 (rather than IFRS 9) as the Company regards such contracts as insurance for the lender against default by the borrower.

IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts has been released but is not yet adopted by the Group. IFRS 17 is effective for reporting periods beginning
on or after 1 January 2023, with comparative figures required. Early application is permitted, provided the entity also applies IFRS 9 and
IFRS 15 on or before the date it first applies IFRS 17.

The Company has performed an initial assessment as to the estimated impact of the adoption of IFRS 17. Based on the assessment
undertaken to date, the impact on the Company’s financial statements in the period of initial application is not expected to be material.

**4. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY**
In the application of the Company’s accounting policies, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions
about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated
assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from
these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future
periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. There are no significant accounting judgements applied in preparation of
the Company’s financial statements.

Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a
significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are
discussed below.

Impairment of investments
At each balance sheet date, the Company reviews the carrying amounts of its investments to determine whether there is any indication
that these have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated to determine
the extent of the impairment loss (if any). The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use
(adjusted for the fair value of debt). If the recoverable amount of an investment is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the
carrying amount of the investment is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss,
unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease. Note 15
in the consolidated financial statements details the assumptions used together with an analysis of the sensitivity to changes in key
assumptions.

#### OTHER INFORMATION
Alternative Performance Measures

**INTRODUCTION**
When assessing and discussing the Group’s reported financial performance, financial position and cash flows, management makes
reference to Alternative Performance Measures (“APMs”) of historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows
that are not defined or specified under International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”).

The APMs used by the Group are financial APMs, usually derived from the financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS.
Certain financial measures cannot be directly derived from the financial statements as they contain additional information such as
financial estimates. The accounting policies applied when calculating APMs are, where relevant and unless otherwise stated,
substantially the same as those disclosed in the Group’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022.
There is no change in APMs compared to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021.

APMs are not uniformly defined by all companies, including those in the Group’s industry, and consequently the APMs used by the
Group may not be comparable with similarly titled measures or disclosures made by other companies. APMs should be considered in
addition to, and not as a substitute for, measures of financial performance, financial position or cash flows reported in accordance with
IFRS.

PURPOSE
The Group uses APMs to aid the comparability of information between reporting periods and business units, either by adjusting for
uncontrollable factors or special items which impact upon IFRS measures, or by aggregating measures, to aid the users of the Annual
Report in understanding the activity taking place across the Group.

Their use is driven by characteristics particularly relevant to the EG Group:

- Adjustments to operating profit – the Group has a significant fixed asset base and consequently incurs a high proportion of
depreciation and amortisation. APMs are used to provide adjusted measures for users of the financial statements to evaluate our
operating performance and our ability to incur and service our indebtedness

- Transactional activity – the Group is in a growth phase in its lifecycle and has made significant acquisitions in the current and previous
reporting periods. Consequently, a high volume of transaction, restructuring and financing costs are incurred within the Group which
do not reflect its underlying business. APMs are used to provide an adjusted measure for users of the financial statements to consider
performance after such items

- Interest cost – the Group is proportionately highly funded by debt when compared to other businesses in its industry and/or of similar
size. APMs are used to provide an adjusted measure for users of the financial statements to consider performance before interest
costs

- Constant currency - a significant amount of the Group's operations do not have USD as functional currency and therefore the financial
performance of the Group, which is reported in USD, is impacted by the change in exchange rates. Constant currency performance is
calculated by translating performance of non-USD regions using the foreign exchange rates applicable in the comparative period and
allows users to compare the Group's performance on a consistent basis

- Certain of the Group’s financial covenants are assessed on a fixed GAAP basis under IAS 17. APMs are used for covenant calculations
and to provide information to users of the accounts which is more readily comparable with that presented in previous periods.
Consequently, APMs are used by the Board and management for planning and reporting. APMs are also referred to in the Group’s
covenant calculations and debt facility arrangements. The measures are also used in discussions with investors in the Group’s secured
notes and credit ratings agencies

#### INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
to the members of EG Group Limited

**OPINION**
We have audited the financial statements of EG Group Limited
(“the Company”) for the year ended December 31, 2021 which
comprise the consolidated income statement, consolidated
statement of comprehensive income, consolidated balance sheet,
consolidated statement of changes in equity, consolidated cash
flow statement, company balance sheet, company statement of
changes in equity and related notes, including the accounting
policies in note 3.

In our opinion:

- The financial statements give a true and fair view of the state
of the Group’s and of the parent Company’s affairs as at
December 31, 2021 and of the Group’s profit for the year
then ended

- The Group financial statements have been properly prepared
in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting
standards

- The parent Company financial statements have been properly
prepared in accordance with UK accounting standards,
including FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework;

- The financial statements have been prepared in accordance
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006

**BASIS FOR OPINION**
We conducted our audit in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law.
Our responsibilities are described below. We have fulfilled our
ethical responsibilities under, and are independent of the Group
in accordance with, UK ethical requirements including the FRC
Ethical Standard, as applied to other entities of public interest.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is a sufficient
and appropriate basis for our opinion.

**GOING CONCERN**
The directors have prepared the financial statements on the going
concern basis as they do not intend to liquidate the Group or the
Company or to cease their operations, and as they have concluded
that the Group and the Company’s financial position means that
this is realistic. They have also concluded that there are no material
uncertainties that could have cast significant doubt over their
ability to continue as a going concern for at least a year from the
date of approval of the financial statements (“the going concern
period”).


We used our knowledge of the entity, its industry and the general
economic environment to identify the inherent risks to its business
model and analysed how those risks might affect the Group’s and
Company’s available financial resources or ability to continue
operations over the going concern period. The risks that we
considered most likely to adversely affect the Group’s and
Company’s available financial resources and metrics relevant
to debt covenants over this period were:

- The impact of rising inflation on revenue, margins, overheads
and interest rates

We considered whether these risks could plausibly affect the
liquidity or covenant compliance in the going concern period by
comparing severe, but plausible, downside scenarios that could
arise from these risks individually and collectively against the level
of available financial resources and covenants indicated by the
Group’s financial forecasts.

We considered whether the going concern disclosure in note 1
to the financial statements gives a full and accurate description
of the directors’ assessment of going concern.

Our conclusions based on this work:

- We consider that the directors’ use of the going concern basis
of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is
appropriate

- We have not identified, and concur with the directors’
assessment that there is not, a material uncertainty related to
events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast
significant doubt on the Group or the Company’s ability to
continue as a going concern for the going concern period

- We found the going concern disclosure in note 1 to be
acceptable

However, as we cannot predict all future events or conditions and
as subsequent events may result in outcomes that are inconsistent
with judgements that were reasonable at the time they were made,
the above conclusions are not a guarantee that the Group or the
Company will continue in operation.

#### INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT CONTINUED
to the members of EG Group Limited


**FRAUD AND BREACHES OF LAWS AND REGULATIONS**
**– ABILITY TO DETECT**
Identifying and responding to risks of material misstatement
due to fraud
To identify risks of material misstatement due to fraud (“fraud
risks”) we assessed events or conditions that could indicate an
incentive or pressure to commit fraud or provide an opportunity
to commit fraud. Our risk assessment procedures included:

- Enquiring of directors, the Audit & Risk Committee, Group
General Counsel and inspection of policy documentation as to
the Group’s channel for “whistleblowing”, as well as whether
they have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud

- Inspection of Board of Directors and Audit & Risk Committee
meeting minutes

- Consideration of the Group’s results against performance
targets and the Group’s remuneration policies

We communicated identified fraud risks throughout the audit team
and remained alert to any indications of fraud throughout the
audit. This included communication from the Group audit team to
full scope component audit teams of relevant fraud risks identified
at the Group level and request to full scope component audit
teams to report to the Group audit team any instances of fraud
that could give rise to a material misstatement at the Group level.

As required by auditing standards, and taking into account
possible pressures to meet profit targets and our overall
knowledge of the control environment, we perform procedures to
address the risk of management override of controls, in particular
the risk that Group management may be in a position to make
inappropriate accounting entries and the risk of bias in accounting
estimates and judgements. On this audit we do not believe there is
a fraud risk related to revenue recognition because the incentive/
pressure and opportunity for management for fraudulent revenue
recognition using revenue account at a transactional level is
limited. Performance targets and other pressures on management
are focused on EBITDA metrics rather than revenue metrics and
the nature of the operations provide limited opportunities to
engage in fraudulent revenue recognition.

We did not identify any additional fraud risks.

We also performed procedures including:

- Identifying journal entries and other adjustments to test for all
full scope components based on risk criteria and comparing the
identified entries to supporting documentation. These included
those posted by users who typically do not create or post
journals; seldom used accounts; journals posted with little or no
description and journals with unusual descriptions or key words

- Assessing whether the judgements made in making accounting
estimates are indicative of a potential bias


Identifying and responding to risks of material misstatement
related to compliance with laws and regulations
We identified areas of laws and regulations that could reasonably
be expected to have a material effect on the financial statements
from our general commercial and sector experience through
discussion with the directors and other management (as required
by auditing standards), and from inspection of the Group’s
regulatory and legal correspondence and discussed with the
directors and other management the policies and procedures
regarding compliance with laws and regulations.

We communicated identified laws and regulations throughout our
team and remained alert to any indications of non-compliance
throughout the audit. This included communication from the
Group audit team to full scope component audit teams of relevant
laws and regulations identified at the Group level, and a request
for full scope component auditors to report to the Group audit
team any instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations
that could give rise to a material misstatement at the Group level.

The potential effect of these laws and regulations on the financial
statements varies considerably.

Firstly, the Group is subject to laws and regulations that directly
affect the financial statements including financial reporting
legislation (including related companies’ legislation), distributable
profits legislation, and taxation legislation (direct and indirect).
We assessed the extent of compliance with these laws and
regulations as part of our procedures on the related financial
statement items.

Secondly, the Group is subject to many other laws and regulations
where the consequences of non-compliance could have a material
effect on amounts or disclosures in the financial statements, for
instance through the imposition of fines or litigation or the loss of
the Group’s license to operate. We identified the following areas as
those most likely to have such an effect:

- Relevant regional fuel storage and related environmental
regulations which control spillages arising from delivery,
storage, and sale of fuel products, relevant food quality,
hygiene and safety regulations, employee health and safety
and Consumer Rights Legislation, reflecting the Group’s
business model

- Data privacy laws, reflecting the Group’s growing amounts of
personal data held

Auditing standards limit the required audit procedures to identify
non-compliance with these laws and regulations to enquiry of the
directors and other management and inspection of regulatory and
legal correspondence, if any. Therefore, if a breach of operational
regulations is not disclosed to us or evident from relevant
correspondence, an audit will not detect that breach.


-----

Context of the ability of the audit to detect fraud or
breaches of law or regulation
Owing to the inherent limitations of an audit, there is an
unavoidable risk that we may not have detected some material
misstatements in the financial statements, even though we have
properly planned and performed our audit in accordance with
auditing standards. For example, the further removed
non‑compliance with laws and regulations is from the events and
transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely
the inherently limited procedures required by auditing standards
would identify it.

In addition, as with any audit, there remained a higher risk of
non-detection of fraud, as these may involve collusion, forgery,
intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of
internal controls. Our audit procedures are designed to detect
material misstatement. We are not responsible for preventing
non-compliance or fraud and cannot be expected to detect
non-compliance with all laws and regulations.

**OTHER INFORMATION**
The Directors are responsible for the other information, which
comprises the strategic report, directors’ report and the
governance report. Our opinion on the financial statements does
not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not
express an audit opinion or, except as explicitly stated below,
any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so,
consider whether, based on our financial statements audit work,
the information therein is materially misstated or inconsistent with
the financial statements or our audit knowledge. Based solely on
that work:

- We have not identified material misstatements in the other
information

- In our opinion the information given in those reports for the
financial year is consistent with the financial statements

- In our opinion those reports have been prepared in accordance
with the Companies Act 2006

**MATTERS ON WHICH WE ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT**
**BY EXCEPTION**
Under the Companies Act 2006, we are required to report to
you if, in our opinion:

- Adequate accounting records have not been kept by the
parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not
been received from branches not visited by us

- The parent Company financial statements are not in agreement
with the accounting records and returns

- Certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by
law are not made

- We have not received all the information and explanations
we require for our audit

We have nothing to report in these respects.


**DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES**
As explained more fully in their statement set out on page 92,
the directors are responsible for: the preparation of the financial
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair
view; such internal control as they determine is necessary to
enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; assessing
the Group and parent Company’s ability to continue as a going
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going
concern; and using the going concern basis of accounting unless
they either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent Company
or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

**AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITIES**
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements as a whole are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue our
opinion in an auditor’s report. Reasonable assurance is a high level
of assurance, but does not guarantee that an audit conducted in
accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud
or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate,
they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic
decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.

A fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRC’s
website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.

**THE PURPOSE OF OUR AUDIT WORK AND TO WHOM WE**
**OWE OUR RESPONSIBILITIES**
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body,
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state
to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state
to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the
fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the
Company’s members, as a body, for our audit work, for this report,
or for the opinions we have formed.

#### NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the year ended December 31, 2021


**1. GENERAL INFORMATION AND BASIS OF PREPARATION**
EG Group Limited is a company incorporated and domiciled in the
United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006. The Company is
a private company limited by shares and is registered in England
and Wales (registration number 09826582), and the address of
the registered office is Waterside Head Office, Haslingden Road,
Guide, Blackburn, Lancashire, United Kingdom, BB1 2FA.

The principal activities of the Company and its subsidiaries
(the ‘Group’) are to operate as a forecourt retailer providing
three primary categories of products: retailing of Grocery &
Merchandise, Foodservice and Fuel and an additional category of
other services.

**Basis of preparation**
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared for
the year ended December 31, 2021 (2020: year ended December
31, 2020) in accordance with the requirements of the Companies
Act 2006 and UK-adopted International Accounting Standards.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in US Dollars,
generally rounded to the nearest million. They are prepared on the
historical cost basis, except for certain financial instruments and
plan assets of defined benefit pension schemes that are measured
at fair value at the end of each reporting period, as explained in
the accounting policies in note 3.

**Going concern**
The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern
basis as the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the
Group has adequate resources for a period of at least twelve
months from the date of approval to August 31, 2023 (the ‘going
concern assessment period’), having assessed the principal and
emerging risks facing the Group and determined that there are no
material uncertainties to disclose.

In determining whether the Group’s financial statements can be
prepared on a going concern basis, the Directors considered the
Group’s business activities together with factors likely to affect
its financial performance and liquidity position. These factors
included actual trading performance during the pandemic, the
trading performance since lockdown restrictions have begun to be
lifted and expectations of the future macroeconomic environment.

The Directors have also considered a number of key factors,
including the Group’s business model, strategy, principal risks and
uncertainties and the financial position of the Group, including
the current cash position and available working capital facilities,
financial forecasts for a period until August 31, 2023, and the
ability to adhere to the covenants contained within the Group’s
financing agreements.

Furthermore, this review has considered the impact of the
integration of the Group’s acquisition activity. The Group’s senior
debt facilities, as set out in note 22, are subject to a financial
covenant measuring net debt to pre-IFRS 16 EBITDA (leverage),
which is tested at the end of each calendar quarter based on the
utilisation levels of the revolving credit facility (“RCF”).

At July 31, 2022, the Group’s net debt position was $9,257m
comprising $443m in cash at bank, $270m cash in transit and on
site, and $9,970m of borrowings. In addition, the Group had access
to undrawn committed facilities of $221m giving total available
liquidity at that time of $934m. The Group’s net debt benefited
from $546m relating to the deferral of tax and duties payable,
presented within trade and other payables, with the majority of the
balance being repaid over a 60 month period from October 2022.


FORECASTS
The resilience of the Group’s earnings have been demonstrated
during the COVID-19 pandemic, where retail and fuel operations
were designated as an essential retailer. Current macroeconomic
factors have also had an impact on the Group including the impact
of inflationary cost increases, driven by growing commodity prices
and rising labour costs. The impact of inflationary pressures on
margins, overheads and general recession related risks have been
built into the Group's forecast scenarios.

Consideration was also given to the conflict in Ukraine which has
continued to develop subsequent to the Group’s balance sheet
date. Resulting from this, there has been significant oil price
volatility in 2022; however, as retail prices adapt to wholesale cost
movements, there has been no material adverse impact on the
Group’s profitability. Inflationary pressures which may be caused
by the conflict are already incorporated into the overall going
concern assessment, as such the impact of the conflict in Ukraine
does not impact the conclusions reached over going concern.

The Directors have prepared base and sensitised cash flow
forecasts for a period until August 31, 2023, which indicate that
the Group and Company will remain compliant with its covenants
and will have sufficient funds through its existing cash balances
and available facilities to meet its liabilities as they fall due for that
period, without any structural changes to the business needed. In
developing the forecasts, the Directors considered the estimated
ongoing impact of the pandemic and the outlook for the business.
This includes the modelling of a number of severe but plausible
scenarios based on the experiences during the pandemic,
recognising the degree of uncertainty that continues to exist.
The scenarios considered include (a) a severe but plausible
downside scenario, and (b) a ‘reverse stress test’ scenario. These
are described in further detail below.

The Group’s severe but plausible downside scenarios reflect the
impact of costs increasing above what can be passed on through
retail prices, where doing so may result in a loss of sales. The
principal trading and recovery assumptions are broadly aligned to
those observed in the Group’s historical performance as described
above. Whilst not a key factor in the Directors’ going concern
conclusion, the Group does also have other significant potential
mitigations at its disposal to improve its short-term liquidity
position and to comply with financial covenants should the need
arise, including scaling back its capital investment programme.
As a result of the uncertainties surrounding the forecasts due to
the current macroeconomic climate, the Group has also modelled
a reverse stress test scenario. The reverse stress test models the
decline in gross margin that the Group would be able to absorb
before requiring additional sources of financing in excess of those
that are available and committed. On the basis of the Group’s
resilient trading performance during the COVID-19 pandemic,
and the observed inverse correlation between fuel margins and
volumes, the Directors have considered that the sequence of
events leading to this scenario would be considered remote.

The Directors continue to consider and assess strategic options
for the Group, which could include refinancing of existing Group
debt, or an Initial Public Offering or trade sale of some or all of the
Group's operations. The forecast scenarios modelled for Going
Concern do not include the impact of these potential options.

The Directors would only approve such strategic options if
appropriate financing arrangements are in place and there is no
impact on the Group's ability to meet its liabilities as they fall due.
Appropriate financing arrangements could include repayment or
refinancing the Group’s debt in the event of a change of control.


-----

CONCLUSION
The Directors are confident that the Group is well positioned to manage its business risks and have considered a number of factors
including current trading performance, the outcomes of a range of possible future trading impacts, current liquidity and the available
mitigating actions. Under the Group’s severe but plausible downside scenario there was sufficient headroom on covenants and cash
headroom during the going concern assessment period. The Directors continue to consider and assess strategic and acquisition
opportunities as they arise and the Directors would only approve such strategic options and/or acquisitions if they are accretive to the
value and position of the Group and sufficient funding is available. Consequently, the Directors are confident that the Group and the
Company will have sufficient funds to continue to meet their liabilities as they fall due in the going concern assessment period to August
31, 2023 and therefore have prepared the financial statements on a going concern basis.

The Group’s accounting policies have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial
statements.

**2. ADOPTION OF NEW AND REVISED STANDARDS, AMENDMENTS AND INTERPRETATIONS**

#### NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
For the year ended December 31, 2021


**3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED**
**Presentational currency continued**
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.

**Foreign currencies and functional currency**
The individual financial statements of each Group subsidiary are
prepared in the currency of the primary economic environment in
which it operates (its functional currency). For the purpose of the
consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position
of the Group are expressed in US Dollars, the presentational
currency for the Group and its consolidated financial statements.

The assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations are
translated into the Group’s presentational currency at exchange
rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Profits and losses are
translated at average exchange rates for the relevant accounting
periods. Exchange differences arising are recognised in the Group
statement of comprehensive income/(loss) and are included in the
Group’s translation reserve.

Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated
into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing
on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated into the
functional currency at the rates of exchange at the reporting date.
Exchange differences on monetary items are recognised in the
income statement.

Intragroup loans are translated at the year-end exchange rate with
the resulting exchange differences recognised within finance costs.

Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of
a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign
entity and translated at the closing rate. Exchange differences
arising are recognised in other comprehensive income.

**Basis of consolidation**
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial
statements of the parent Company, EG Group Limited, all entities
controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries) and the Group’s share
of its interests in joint ventures made up to December 31 each
year. Control is achieved when the Company has the power over
the investee, is exposed, or has rights, to variable return from its
involvement with the investee, and has the ability to use its power
to affects its returns.

SUBSIDIARIES
Subsidiaries are consolidated in the Group’s financial statements
from the date that control commences until the date that control
ceases. Intragroup balances and any unrealised gains and losses
or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions are
eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.

A list of all the subsidiaries of the Group is included in note 18 of
the Group financial statements. All apply accounting policies which
are consistent with those of the rest of the Group.

JOINT VENTURES
The Group’s share of the results of joint ventures is included
in the Group income statement and Group statement of other
comprehensive income/(loss) using the equity method of
accounting.

Investments in joint ventures are carried in the Group balance
sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of
the net assets of the entity, less any impairment in value.


The carrying values of investments in joint ventures include
acquired goodwill. If the Group’s share of losses in a joint venture
equals or exceeds its investment in the joint venture, the Group
does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations
to do so or made payments on behalf of the joint venture.
Dividends received from joint ventures with nil carrying value are
recognised in the income statement as part of the Group’s share of
post-tax profits/(losses) of joint ventures.

Unrealised gains arising from transactions with joint ventures
are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the entity.
The Group’s interests in joint ventures are detailed in note 19.

**Exceptional items**
In addition to presenting information on an IFRS basis, the Group
also presents an income statement that separately identifies
exceptional items, including the impact of related tax, as shown in
a separate column. This adjusted information is disclosed to allow
a better understanding of the underlying trading performance of
the Group and is consistent with the Group’s internal management
reporting. These measures are used for performance analysis.

Exceptional items are those which are separately identified by
virtue of their size or incidence and include, but are not limited
to, acquisition costs, impairment charges, reorganisation costs,
profits and losses on disposal of subsidiaries and other one-off
items which meet this definition. The Group adopts a minimum
threshold of $1m for the separate identification of exceptional
items, which is applied to the aggregate value over the relevant
accounting periods. The Group exercises judgement in assessing
whether items should be classified as exceptional. This assessment
covers both the nature of the item, cause of occurrence and the
scale of impact of that item on reported performance. Reversals of
previous exceptional items are also classified as exceptional.

**Revenue recognition**
The Group provides three primary categories of products and
services to its customers: Grocery & Merchandise, Foodservice
and Fuel. The Group also provides ancillary services such as
car washes, lotteries, payzones, ATMs etc. through its forecourt
operations which are recognised within other revenue.

Revenue is recognised when the Group has a contract with a
customer and a performance obligation has been satisfied, at the
transaction price allocated to that performance obligation. The
Group does not adjust any of the transaction prices for the time
value of money due to the nature of the Group’s transactions
being completed shortly after the transaction is entered into with
the customer.

SALE OF GOODS
Revenue from the sale of fuel and goods in store is recognised
when the transaction is completed in store or at the filling station.

Revenue from fuel sales to authorised dealers is recognised when
the goods are delivered to the specific site location and control
passes.

The transaction price is the value of the goods net of VAT.

Fuel and each good sold in store is considered distinct as it is sold
to customers on a standalone basis. The standalone selling price of
fuel and goods is estimated on the basis of the retail price, except
for sales to authorised dealers which is determined on the basis of
the wholesale price. Discounts are not considered as they are only
given in rare circumstances and are not material.


-----

Payment of the transaction price is due immediately when the
customer purchases the fuel at the filling station or takes delivery
of the goods in store. A receivable is recognised by the Group
when the goods are delivered to the authorised dealers as this
represents the point in time at which the right to consideration
becomes unconditional, as only the passage of time is required
before payment is due.

Given the nature of the business and products sold, expected
returns are not considered as they are infrequent and are not
material.

GROSS VERSUS NET PRESENTATION – FUEL DUTY
The treatment of fuel duty is determined by local laws and
regulations as to when the duty becomes legally payable and
who carries the risks and obligations to the tax authorities. In all
markets where fuel duty is applicable to fuel purchases and sales,
the cost of sales and revenues are reported including these duties,
as the Group’s role in the transaction is that of principal.

LOYALTY PROGRAMMES
The Group operates certain customer loyalty programmes where
customers accumulate points for all purchases made, which
entitles them to discounts on future purchases. These loyalty
programmes are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 15.

AGENT V PRINCIPAL – DEALER SITES
Within the Group, there are a number of ‘dealer’ or ‘retailer’
arrangements in place, whereby a third party will be responsible
for some part of the operation of a site.

In line with IFRS 15, when another party is involved in providing
goods or services to a customer, the Group determines whether
the nature of its promise is a performance obligation to provide
the specified goods or services itself (i.e. the Group is acting as
principal) or to arrange for those goods or services to be provided
by the other party (i.e. the Group is an agent). In making this
assessment, a principal is identified as being the party that obtains
control of the assets, which are then transferred to the customer.
When the Group acts as principal, revenue is recognised in respect
of the gross amount of consideration paid by the customer.

When the Group does not control the goods which are transferred,
it acts as an agent and recognises revenue only in the amount
of any fee or commission to which it expects to be entitled in
exchange for arranging for the specified goods or services to be
provided by the other party.

Generally, the Group’s revenue streams from dealer sites fall into
the following broad categories:

- Supply of goods to dealers – the Group acts as a principal in
supplying goods to dealers, transferring control and recognising
revenue at the point of sale to the dealer as the Group is
primarily responsible for fulfilling the order of goods from the
dealers and has the latitude in establishing the price

- Goods sold on consignment from dealer sites – the Group acts
as a principal in selling the goods to end customers as it retains
ownership of goods on consignment until they are sold to an
end consumer and the latitude to establish the price. The Group
recognises revenue in respect of the full sales value to the end
consumer at the point the goods are sold, with commissions
paid to the dealer in respect of the transaction recognised
within cost of sales

- Site rental fees – rental fees earned from dealers on sites
are recognised in other income over the life of the lease in
accordance with IFRS 16


The redemption of points is treated as a separate performance
obligation under IFRS 15, with the transaction price allocated
to issued points with reference to the likelihood of redemption
and the discounts to be given to the customer on redemption
of the points. Revenue from loyalty points is recognised when
the customer redeems the points. Revenue for points that are
not expected to be redeemed is recognised in proportion to the
pattern of rights exercised by customers. A contract liability is
recognised in respect of the price allocated to points which remain
unredeemed and are expected to be exercised by the customer at
year end.

PROVISION OF SERVICES
Revenue from the provision of services such as car washes,
lotteries, payzones, ATMs etc. is recognised when the service
is provided as that is the point in time at which the customer
benefits from the service. Where the Group acts as an agent
selling goods or services, only the commission income is included
within revenue.

COMMERCIAL INCOME
Supplier incentives, rebates and discounts are collectively referred
to as commercial income. Commercial income is recognised as a
deduction from cost of sales on an accruals basis based on the
expected entitlement which has been earned up to the balance
sheet date for each relevant supplier contract.

Amounts due relating to commercial income are recognised within
trade and other receivables, except in cases where the Group
currently has a legally enforceable right of set-off and intends to
offset amounts due from suppliers against amounts owed to those
suppliers, in which case only the net amount receivable or payable
is recognised. Accrued commercial income is recognised within
accrued income when commercial income earned has not been
invoiced at the balance sheet date.

FRANCHISE COSTS
The Group operates a number of brands under franchise
agreements across its jurisdictions. Costs paid to franchise owners
are presented within cost of sales.

FINANCE INCOME AND COSTS
Finance income and costs are recognised in the consolidated
income statement in the year to which it relates using the effective
interest rate method.

Finance income comprises of:

- Interest receivable which is recognised in the consolidated
income statement as it accrues using the effective interest
method

- Foreign exchange gains arising on financing

- Finance income is recognised in the consolidated income
statement in the year in which it occurs

Finance costs comprise of:

- Interest payable which is recognised in the consolidated income
statement as it accrues using the effective interest method

- Foreign exchange losses arising on financing

- Finance costs incurred on finance leases which are recognised in
profit or loss using the effective interest method

- Financing costs of raising debt

#### NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
For the year ended December 31, 2021


**3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED**
**Business combinations and goodwill**
The Group accounts for all business combinations by applying the
acquisition method. All acquisition-related costs are expensed as
incurred. On acquisition, the assets (including intangible assets),
liabilities and contingent liabilities of an acquired entity are
measured at their fair value. Non-controlling interest is stated at
the non-controlling interest’s proportion of the fair values of the
assets and liabilities recognised. Where an acquisition of trade and
assets takes place, an assessment is initially made as to whether it
should be accounted under IFRS 3 or not.

Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the
consideration transferred over the net fair value of the Group’s
share of the net assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the
acquired subsidiary, joint venture and the fair value of the noncontrolling interest in the acquiree.

If the consideration is less than the fair value of the Group’s
share of the net assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the
acquired entity (i.e. a discount on acquisition), the difference
is credited to the Group income statement in the period of
acquisition.

At the acquisition date of a subsidiary, goodwill acquired is
recognised as an asset and is allocated to each of the cashgenerating units expected to benefit from the business
combination’s synergies and to the lowest level at which
management monitors the goodwill. Goodwill arising on the
acquisition of joint ventures is included within the carrying value of
the investment.

On disposal of a subsidiary or joint venture, the attributable
amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit
or loss on disposal. On disposal of a cash-generating unit, the
attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of
the profit or loss on disposal.

Where the Group obtains control of a joint venture, the Group’s
previously held interests in the acquired entity is remeasured to its
acquisition date fair value and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is
recognised in the Group income statement.

If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete
by the end of the reporting period in which the combination
occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for
which the accounting is incomplete. Those provisional amounts
are adjusted during the twelve-month measurement period,
or additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect new
information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed
as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the
amounts recognised as of that date.

**Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations**
Non-current assets (or disposal groups) are classified as assets
held for sale when their carrying amount is to be recovered
principally through a sale transaction and a sale is considered
highly probable. They are stated at the lower of carrying amount
and fair value less costs to sell.

In accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale
and Discontinued Operations, the net results of discontinued
operations are presented separately in the consolidated income
statement (and the comparatives restated) and the assets and
liabilities of these operations are presented separately in the
consolidated balance sheet. Refer to note 8 for further details.


**Property, plant and equipment**
Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less
subsequent depreciation and impairment. Historical cost includes
expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the
assets. Properties in the course of construction are carried at cost,
less any recognised impairment loss.

Cost includes professional fees and, for qualifying assets,
borrowing costs capitalised in accordance with the Group’s
accounting policy.

Depreciation of these assets commences when the assets are
ready for their intended use. Freehold land is not depreciated.

Assets under construction are not depreciated until they are ready
for use and transferred to the appropriate group of assets.

Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation
of assets (other than freehold land and properties under
construction) less their residual values over their useful lives, using
the straight-line method, on the following bases:

Freehold land not depreciated

Buildings 20 to 30 years

Fixtures and fittings 3 to 30 years

The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation
method are reviewed at the end of each reporting year, with the
effect of any changes in estimate accounted for on a prospective
basis.

For periods ended December 31, 2018 and prior, assets held under
finance leases were depreciated over their expected useful lives
on the same basis as owned assets. However, when there is no
reasonable certainty that ownership would be obtained by the end
of the lease term, assets were depreciated over the shorter of the
lease term and their useful lives.

An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon
disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to
arise from the continued use of the asset. When a decision has
been made to dispose of or scrap an asset in the future, the
remaining useful life is re-evaluated to reflect the period over
which the Group will derive economic benefits from its use.

The gain or loss arising on the disposal or scrappage of an asset
is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and
the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income
statement.

**Impairment of property, plant and equipment**
The Group reviews the carrying amounts of its property, plant
and equipment if there are indications that assets might be
impaired. In performing the review, assets are grouped together
into the smallest group of assets that is largely independent of the
Group’s other cash-generating streams. If events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying value of property, plant
and equipment may not be recoverable, the Group determines
the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of the asset is
estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss
(if any). The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less
costs to sell and value-in-use. In assessing the value-in-use, the
Group considers site performance and development plans that
have been established at the balance sheet date. Where there is
a plan to knock down and rebuild a site, the carrying value of the
site is deemed to be the land value and impaired.


-----

Fair value is determined as the price that would be received to
sell the cash-generating unit (“CGU”) in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date. To the
extent that the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount,
the asset is impaired and is written down. Any impairment loss
arising is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Prior impairments of non-financial assets are reviewed for
possible reversal at each reporting date. A previously recognised
impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change
in the assumptions used to determine the asset’s recoverable
amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. The
reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does
not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying
amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation,
had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior
years. Such reversals are recognised in the consolidated income
statement. Where there is a plan to knock down and rebuild a site,
the carrying value of the site is deemed to be the land value and
it is impaired. Any impairment loss arising is recognised in the
consolidated income statement.

**Intangible assets**
Intangible assets, such as trade names, customer relationships
and software, are measured initially at acquisition cost or costs
incurred to develop the asset.

Development expenditure incurred on an individual project is
capitalised only if specific criteria are met, including that the asset
created will generate future economic benefits. Intangible assets
acquired in a business combination are recognised at fair value at
the acquisition date.

Following initial recognition, intangible assets with finite useful
lives are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and
accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation is charged to the
consolidated income statement in administrative expenses on a
straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each asset as
show below.

Trade names 20 years or indefinite in specific
instances

Customer/dealer relationships 10 to 15 years

Other intangible assets 3 to 16 years according to the
estimated life of the asset

In accordance with IAS 38, amortisation methods, useful lives and
residual values are reviewed at each balance sheet date with the
effect of any changes in estimate accounted for on a prospective
basis.

**Impairment of non-financial assets**
Goodwill and indefinite life brands are not amortised but are
reviewed for impairment at least annually by assessing the
recoverable amount of each cash-generating unit to which the
goodwill relates. The Group allocates goodwill to groups of cashgenerating units, where each country represents a group of cashgenerating units.

The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs
of disposal and value-in-use. When the recoverable amount of
the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount, an
impairment loss is recognised immediately in the Group income
statement, and is not subsequently reversed.


Fair value is determined based on forecast earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (“EBITDA”, which
is a non-IFRS measure) and EBITDA valuation multiples of
comparable corporations and market transactions. For the
purpose of the impairment test, management uses estimates
and assumptions to establish the fair value of the Group’s cashgenerating units. If these assumptions and estimates prove to be
incorrect, the carrying value of the goodwill may be overstated.

For all other non-financial assets (including intangible assets,
property, plant and equipment and right of use assets) the
Group performs impairment testing where there are indicators of
impairment. If such an indicator exists, the recoverable amount
of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the
impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash
flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates
the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the
asset belongs.

If the recoverable amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is
less than the carrying amount of the unit, the carrying amount of
the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable
amount. The impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the
carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to
the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying
amount of each asset in the unit.

Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying
amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is increased to
the revised estimate of the recoverable amount, but so that the
increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount
that would have been determined if no impairment loss had been
recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately as a
credit to the consolidated income statement.

**Leases**
The Group assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease at
inception of the contract. The Group recognises a right of use
asset and a corresponding lease liability with respect to all lease
arrangements in which it is the lessee, except for short-term
leases (defined as leases with a lease term of twelve months or
less) and leases of low-value assets (such as tablets and personal
computers, small items of office furniture and telephones).

For these leases, the Group recognises the lease payments as an
operating expense within distribution costs on a straight-line basis
over the term of the lease unless another systematic basis is more
representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits
from the leased assets are consumed.

LEASE LIABILITIES
Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability
comprise:

- Fixed lease payments (including in-substance fixed payments),
less any lease incentives receivable

- Variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate, initially
measured using the index or rate at the commencement date

- The amount expected to be payable by the lessee under residual
value guarantees

- The exercise price of purchase options, if the lessee is
reasonably certain to exercise the options

- Payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term
reflects the exercise of an option to terminate the lease

The lease liability is presented as a separate line in the
consolidated balance sheet.


-----

#### NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
For the year ended December 31, 2021


**3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED**
**Leases continued**
LEASE LIABILITIES continued

The Group remeasures the lease liability (and makes a
corresponding adjustment to the related right of use asset)
whenever:

- The lease term has changed or there is a change in the
assessment of exercise of a purchase option, in which case the
lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease
payments using a revised discount rate

- The lease payments change due to changes in an index or
rate or a change in expected payment under a guaranteed
residual value, in which cases the lease liability is remeasured by
discounting the revised lease payments using the initial discount
rate (unless the lease payment’s change is due to a change in
a floating interest rate, in which case a revised discount rate is
used)

- A lease contract is modified and the lease modification is
not accounted for as a separate lease, in which case the
lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease
payments using a revised discount rate. The Group did not make
any such adjustments during the periods presented

The variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a
rate are recognised as an expense within distribution costs in the
period in which the event or condition that triggers the payment
occurs. In calculating the present value of lease payments, the
Group uses the incremental borrowing rate (“IBR”) at the lease
commencement date if the interest rate implicit in the lease is not
readily determinable. As the rate implicit in the lease generally
cannot be readily determined for property leases, the Group uses
incremental borrowing rates, being the rate that the individual
lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain
an asset of similar value to the right of use asset in a similar
economic environment with similar terms, security and conditions.

In order to calculate the IBR for the Group in each territory, a
risk-free rate is obtained, linked to the length of the lease in the
jurisdiction in which the lease is taken, and an adjustment is then
made to reflect credit risk based on the Group’s credit rating.

RIGHT OF USE ASSETS
The Group recognises right of use assets at the commencement
date of the lease (i.e. the date the underlying asset is available
for use). Right of use assets are measured at cost, less any
accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted
for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right of use
assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial
direct costs incurred, restoration costs, and lease payments made
at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives
received.

Whenever the Group incurs an obligation for costs to dismantle
and remove a leased asset, restore the site on which it is located
or restore the underlying asset to the condition required by the
terms and conditions of the lease, a provision is recognised and
measured under IAS 37. To the extent that the costs relate to a
right of use asset, the costs are included in the related right of use
asset.

Unless the Group is reasonably certain to obtain ownership of the
leased asset at the end of the lease term, the recognised right of
use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter
of their estimated useful life and the lease term. Right of use assets
are presented as a separate line in the consolidated balance sheet
and are subject to impairment under IAS 36.


For contracts that contain a lease component and one or more
additional lease or non-lease components, the Group allocates
the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the
basis of the relative standalone price of the lease component and
the aggregate standalone price of the non-lease components.

DETERMINATION OF THE LEASE TERM
Extension and termination options are included in a number of
property and equipment leases across the Group.

In determining the lease term, management considers all facts and
circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise an
extension option, or not exercise a termination option. Extension
options (or periods after termination options) are only included
in the lease term if the lease is reasonably certain to be extended
(or not terminated). This is a subjective assessment made at
an individual lease level, reflecting the facts and circumstances
applicable to each arrangement. Generally, at the commencement
date of property leases, the Group determines the lease term to
be the full term of the lease and the first two periods covered by
extension options (to the extent that these are within the Group’s
control) as the Group is reasonably certain that it will continue in
occupation for the periods covered by these extension options.

In determining whether termination options will be exercised, the
Group makes reference to the economic incentives to not exercise
a termination option for both the Group and the lessor along with
the anticipated costs of termination for both parties.

This assessment is judgemental and reflects the Group’s
expectations at the time of lease inception. Should facts and
circumstances change, the Group may reassess lease terms,
resulting in a remeasurement of lease liabilities and right of use
assets.

The assessment is reviewed if a significant event or a significant
change in circumstances occurs which affects this assessment and
that is within the control of the lessee.

SALE AND LEASEBACK TRANSACTIONS
In a sale and leaseback transaction, the Group transfers control
of an asset to another entity for consideration, and leases that
asset back from the buyer. The Group immediately recognises a
lease liability in respect of the present value of the expected lease
payments. The carrying value of the asset is divided between the
value of the rights retained by the Group (recognised as a lease
asset under IFRS 16) and the rights transferred to the purchaser on
a pro-rata basis based on the respective fair values of the property
and lease payments at the time of sale. Any profit or loss on
disposal is similarly allocated between the retained and transferred
rights, with the portion relating to the buyer’s rights in the asset
being recognised immediately.

**Taxation**
The tax expense for the year represents the sum of the tax
currently payable and deferred tax. Current and deferred tax
are recognised in profit or loss, except when they relate to items
that are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly
in equity, in which case the current and deferred tax are also
recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity
respectively.

Where current tax or deferred tax arises from the initial accounting
for a business combination, the tax effect is included in the
accounting for the business combination.


-----

CURRENT TAX
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on taxable
profit or loss for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as
reported in the income statement because it excludes items of
income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other periods
or items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability
for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted
or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Tax provisions are recognised for uncertain tax positions where
a risk of an additional tax liability has been identified and it is
probable that the Group will be required to settle that tax.
A provision is made for uncertain tax positions when it is
considered probable that there will be a future outflow of funds
to a tax authority. The provision is calculated using the single
best estimate where that outcome is more likely than not and a
weighted average probability in other circumstances. The position
is reviewed on an ongoing basis, to ensure appropriate provision is
made for each tax jurisdiction. This is assessed on a case-by-case
basis using in-house tax experts, professional firms and previous
experience. See note 14.

DEFERRED TAX
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method,
providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts
of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the
amounts used for taxation purposes.

Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected
to apply in the year when the liability is settled or the asset is
realised based on tax laws and rates that have been enacted or
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax
is charged or credited in the income statement, except when
it relates to items charged or credited in other comprehensive
income, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in other
comprehensive income.

Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable
that taxable profits will be available against which deductible
temporary differences can be utilised. The carrying amount of
deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and
reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient
taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to
be recovered. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable
temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries,
and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to
control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable
that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable
future.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally
enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax
liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same
taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax
assets and liabilities on a net basis.

No deferred tax liabilities are recognised for temporary differences
that arise on the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial
recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets
and liabilities in a transaction, that affects neither the taxable profit
nor the accounting profit.


**Employee benefits**
I) POST-EMPLOYMENT SCHEMES
The Group operates various post-employment schemes, including
both defined benefit and defined contribution plans. For defined
benefit plans, obligations are measured at discounted present
value (using the projected unit credit method) whilst plan assets
are recorded at fair value. The operating and financing costs
of such plans are recognised separately in the Group income
statement; service costs are spread systematically over the
expected service lives of employees and financing costs are
recognised in the periods in which they arise. Actuarial gains and
losses are recognised immediately in the Group consolidated
statement of comprehensive income. Payments to defined
contribution schemes are recognised as an expense as they fall
due.

II) OTHER EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
Some Group companies provide jubilee benefits, rewarding
employees for long years of service. The liability recognised in
the balance sheet is the present value of the obligation at the
reporting date. The jubilee benefits are calculated annually by
independent actuaries.

III) TERMINATION BENEFITS/RESTRUCTURING PROVISION
Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated
by the Group before the normal retirement date, or whenever an
employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these
benefits. Benefits falling due more than twelve months after
the reporting date are discounted to present value. The Group
recognises termination benefits at the earlier of the following
dates:

- When the Group can no longer withdraw the offer of those
benefits

- When the Group recognises costs for a restructuring that
is within the scope of IAS 37 and involves the payment of
termination benefits

Long-term employee benefits are accounted for in the same
way as defined benefit pension benefits with the exception that
remeasurements are recognised immediately through profit or
loss.

A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group
has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the
restructuring either has commenced or has been announced
publicly before the reporting date. Future operating costs are not
provided for.

IV) BONUS PLANS
The Group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses. The
Group recognises an accrual where contractually obliged or where
there is a past practice that has created a constructive obligation.

**Inventories**
Inventories comprise goods held for resale and are valued at
the lower of cost or net realisable value. The Group applies the
weighted average cost method to value inventories. The cost
of fuel and oil purchased for resale includes all costs incurred in
transporting the goods to their present location. Net realisable
value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of
business, less the cost of selling expenses.

#### NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
For the year ended December 31, 2021


**3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED**
**Financial instruments**
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the
Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the
contractual provisions of the instrument.

FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
Financial assets and liabilities principally consist of trade and other
receivables, accrued income, cash and cash equivalents, trade
and other payables, borrowings and derivative financial assets/
liabilities held at fair value through profit and loss.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents include cash at bank, in hand,
short-term deposits with banks and other financial institutions
with an initial maturity of three months or less, and credit/debit
card receivables, which are settled within 72 hours.

Bank overdrafts are presented as short-term borrowings, and are
reflected as a financing activity in the statement of cash flows.

TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES
Trade receivables are recognised initially at the amount of
consideration that is unconditionally due from customers for
goods sold or services performed in the ordinary course of
business.

The Group holds trade and other receivables with the objective to
collect the contractual cash flows and therefore measures them
subsequently at amortised cost. Loss allowances are recognised
based on expected irrecoverable amounts determined by
reference to past default experience and are adjusted to reflect
current and forward-looking information based on macroeconomic
factors and other factors which affect the ability of the customers
to settle the receivables.

TRADE AND OTHER PAYABLES
Trade and other payables (excluding derivative financial liabilities)
are recorded at cost.

FINANCIAL LIABILITIES AND EQUITY COMPONENTS
Debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial
liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the
contractual arrangement.

An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual
interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities.
Equity instruments issued by the Group are recognised at the
proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.

FINANCIAL ASSETS
All financial assets are recognised and derecognised on a trade
date where the purchase or sale of a financial asset is under
a contract whose terms require delivery of the financial asset
within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and
are initially measured at fair value, plus directly attributable
transaction costs, except for those financial assets classified as
at fair value through profit or loss, which are initially measured
at fair value. Subsequently, financial assets will be measured at
amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income
(“FVTOCI”), or fair value through profit and loss (“FVTPL”), on the
basis of both the Company’s model for managing the assets and
the contractual cash flows associated with them. Where a trade
receivable does not contain a significant financing component
under IFRS 15, it will be measured at its transaction price.


EQUITY INSTRUMENTS
The Group holds investments in unlisted shares that are not traded
in an active market but that are stated at fair value. Fair value is
determined in the manner described in note 34. Where an equity
instrument is not held for trading and does not involve contingent
consideration to which IFRS 3 applies, a determination may be
made on an asset-by-asset basis to recognise gains and losses
arising from changes in fair value in other comprehensive income
or through profit or loss.

Where an election is made to recognise gains and losses arising
from changes in fair value in other comprehensive income, the
cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in the investments
revaluation reserve will remain in this reserve on disposal.

Where this election is not made for an equity instrument, all gains
and losses arising from changes in fair value will be recognised
in the income statement as they arise. Dividends on all equity
instruments are recognised in profit or loss when the Group’s right
to receive the dividends is established.

AMORTISED COST
Financial assets are measured at amortised cost where the asset
is held for the objective of collecting contractual cash flows and
the terms of the asset give rise to cash flows on specific dates
that are solely payments of principal and interest on the amount
outstanding.

The effective interest method is utilised in the calculation of
amortised cost of a debt instrument and for allocating interest
income over the relevant period.

The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts
estimated future cash receipts (including all fees and points paid
or received that form an integral part of the effective interest
rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts) through
the expected life of the debt instrument, or, where appropriate, a
shorter period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.

Income is recognised on an effective interest basis for debt
instruments other than those financial assets classified as at fair
value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”).

FINANCIAL ASSETS AT FVTOCI
Financial assets are measured at FVTOCI if the asset is held within
a business model for the dual objectives of collecting contractual
cash flows and selling financial assets, and the contractual terms
give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments
of principal and interest on the principal amount.

FINANCIAL ASSETS AT FVTPL
All financial assets which do not meet the criteria for measurement
at amortised cost or FVTOCI are measured at FVTPL. Financial
assets at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any gains or losses
arising on remeasurement recognised in profit or loss. The net gain
or loss recognised in profit or loss incorporates any dividend or
interest earned on the financial asset. Fair value is determined in
the manner described in note 34.

IMPAIRMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS

- At each balance sheet date, financial assets are assessed
for indicators of impairment, considering all reasonable and
supportable information available, including that which is
forward-looking where this is available without undue cost
and effort. If the credit risk on a financial asset has increased
significantly since initial recognition, an impairment equivalent
to the lifetime expected credit losses on the instrument will be
recognised immediately. If the credit risk has not significantly
increased since initial recognition, a loss allowance shall be
measured equivalent to twelve-month expected credit losses


-----

- Loss allowances for trade receivables resulting from transactions
under IFRS 15 will always be measured at an amount equal to
the lifetime expected credit loss (“ECL”)

Lifetime ECLs are the ECLs that result from all possible default
events over the expected life of a financial instrument. Twelvemonth ECLs are the portion of ECLs that result from default events
that are possible within the twelve months after the reporting date.

ECLs are a probability weighted estimate of credit losses.

For certain categories of financial asset, such as trade receivables,
assets that are assessed not to be impaired individually are, in
addition, assessed for impairment on a collective basis. Objective
evidence of impairment for a portfolio of receivables could include
the Group’s past experience of collecting payments, an increase in
the number of delayed payments in the portfolio past the average
credit period, as well as observable changes in national or local
economic conditions that correlate with default on receivables.

The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the
impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception
of trade receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced
through the use of an allowance account. When a trade receivable
is considered uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance
account.

Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are
credited against the allowance account. Changes in the carrying
amount of the allowance account are recognised in profit or loss.

The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off when
the Group has no reasonable expectations of recovering a financial
asset in its entirety or a portion thereof. However, financial assets
that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities
in order to comply with the Group’s procedures for recovery of
amounts due.

DERECOGNITION OF FINANCIAL ASSETS
The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the
contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when
it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and
rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity, or when there
is no reasonable expectation of recovering the asset.

On derecognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference
between the asset’s carrying amount and the sum of the
consideration received and receivable and the cumulative gain
or loss that had been recognised in other comprehensive income
and accumulated in equity is recognised in profit or loss, with the
exception of those equity instruments where a determination has
been made to recognise gains and losses arsing from changes in
fair value in other comprehensive income.

FINANCIAL GUARANTEE CONTRACT LIABILITIES
Financial guarantee contract liabilities are measured initially at
their fair values and are subsequently measured at the higher of:

- The amount of the loss allowance determined in accordance
with IFRS 9

- The amount initially recognised less, where appropriate, the
cumulative amount of income recognised in accordance with
the Group’s revenue recognition policies


FINANCIAL LIABILITIES
Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities ‘at fair
value through profit or loss’ (“FVTPL”) or ‘other financial liabilities’
carried at amortised cost. Financial liabilities are initially measured
at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs (except
those measured at FVTPL which are initially measured at fair
value).

FINANCIAL LIABILITIES AT FVTPL
Financial liabilities are classified as at FVTPL when the financial
liability is contingent consideration that may be paid by an
acquirer as part of a business combination to which IFRS 3
applies, or it is designated as at FVTPL. A financial liability
will be designated as FVTPL where this significantly reduces
a measurement inconsistency which would otherwise arise,
or where the group of liabilities (or assets and liabilities as a
combined group) is managed and evaluated on a fair value basis,
and information about the Group is provided on that basis to key
management personnel.

Financial liabilities at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any gains
or losses arising on remeasurement recognised in profit or loss.

The net gain or loss recognised in profit or loss incorporates any
interest paid on the financial liability. Fair value is determined in
the manner described in note 34.

OTHER FINANCIAL LIABILITIES
Other financial liabilities, including interest-bearing bank loans
and credit facilities, are initially measured at fair value, net of
transaction costs. Other financial liabilities are subsequently
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method,
with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis.

The effective interest method is a method of calculating the
amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest
expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is
the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments
through the expected life of the financial liability, or, where
appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount on initial
recognition.

DERECOGNITION OF FINANCIAL LIABILITIES
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when,
the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or have expired.
The difference between the carrying amount of the financial
liability derecognised and the consideration paid and payable is
recognised in profit or loss.

When the Group exchanges with the existing lender one debt
instrument for another one with substantially different terms, such
exchange is accounted for as an extinguishment of the original
financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability.
Similarly, the Group accounts for substantial modification of terms
of an existing liability or part of it as an extinguishment of the
original financial liability and the recognition of a new liability.

It is assumed that the terms are substantially different if the
discounted present value of the cash flows under the new terms,
including any fees paid net of any fees received and discounted
using the original effective rate, is at least 10% different from
the discounted present value of the remaining cash flows of the
original financial liability.

Where the change in terms reflects only a non-substantial
modification, a gain or loss equal to the difference between the
present value of cash flows under the new and the old terms will
be immediately recognised in profit or loss.


-----

#### NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
For the year ended December 31, 2021


**3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED**
**Financial instruments continued**
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments
to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange rate
risk, including foreign exchange forward contracts and interest
rate swaps. Further details of derivative financial instruments are
disclosed in note 34.

Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date
a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently
remeasured to their fair value at each balance sheet date. The
resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss immediately.

A derivative with a positive fair value is recognised as a financial
asset whereas a derivative with a negative fair value is recognised
as a financial liability. A derivative is presented as a non-current
asset or a non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the
instrument is more than twelve months and it is not expected to
be realised or settled within twelve months. Other derivatives are
presented as current assets or current liabilities.

**Provisions**
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation
(legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable
that the Group will be required to settle that obligation and a
reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of
the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the
balance sheet date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties
surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured using
the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its
carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows (when
the effect of the time value of money is material) using a pre-tax
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time
value of money. The increase in the provision due to passage of
time is recognised as a finance cost.

When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle
a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, a
receivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that
reimbursement will be received and the amount of the receivable
can be measured reliably.

Where asset retirement obligations (‘dismantling’) and other
asset-related provisions are recorded, a corresponding asset is
recognised which is depreciated over the period for which the
provision relates.

CONTINGENT LIABILITIES ACQUIRED IN A BUSINESS
COMBINATION
Contingent liabilities acquired in a business combination are
initially measured at fair value at the acquisition date, and
recognised as a provision in accordance with IFRS 3 Business
Combinations.

**Government grants**
Government grants are recognised where there is reasonable
assurance that the grant will be received. Grants that compensate
the Group for expenses incurred are recognised in the income
statement in the relevant financial statement line on a systematic
basis in the periods in which the expenses are recognised, to
present the net expense to the Group.


**Share-based compensation**
EG Group Holdings Limited, as the ultimate parent Company of
the Group, has issued cash-settled shares to the Non-Executive
Directors of the business. Cash-settled share-based payment
transactions are measured at fair value at the date of grant and
remeasured at the end of each reporting period and at the date
of settlement. The fair value is expensed on a straight-line basis
over the expected vesting period, with any changes in fair value
recognised in profit or loss for the period. As the shares awarded
are issued by the ultimate parent Company without charge to the
Company, an amount equivalent to the expense recorded in the
consolidated income statement is recorded as a credit to a capital
contribution reserve.

Fair value is measured using a Monte Carlo simulation pricing
approach in calculating the expected returns to the management
shares. This is seen as an appropriate method for estimating the
value of instruments with growth potential and is based upon
information about the business and forecast performance.

**4. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY**
**SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY**
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which
are described in note 3, the Directors are required to make
judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from
other sources.

The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical
experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an
ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised
in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects
only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods
if the revision affects both current and future periods.

**Significant judgements in applying the Group’s accounting**
**policies**
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, which
are described above, the Directors have made the following
judgements that have the most significant effect on the amounts
recognised in the financial statements (apart from those involving
estimations, which are dealt with below) and have been identified
as being particularly complex or involve subjective assessments.

CARRYING VALUE OF GOODWILL
For the year ended December 31, 2021 impairment reviews were
performed by comparing the carrying value of the cash-generating
units with their recoverable amount. The recoverable amounts
for cash-generating units have been determined based on their
fair value less costs to sell. Management determined that due to
the potential for increased use of alternative fuel vehicles in the
long term, it was more appropriate to use fair value to assess
impairment because accounting standards do not permit in a
value-in-use calculation the inclusion of earnings generated from
future expansionary capital expenditure on the Group’s existing
multi-use retail sites.


-----

EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS
The Directors consider that an adjusted profit measure provides
useful information for the underlying trends, performance and
position of the Group. These measures are consistent with how
business performance is measured internally by the Board.

Profit before exceptionals is not a recognised measure under IFRS
and may not be directly comparable with adjusted measures used
by other companies.

The Directors exercise judgement in determining the items to
classify as exceptional items. This assessment considers the nature
of the item, cause of occurrence and the scale of impact of that
item on reported performance. Reversals of previous exceptional
items are recognised as exceptional items. Directors exercise
judgement in ensuring there is an equal focus by management in
classifying both expenses and revenue items as exceptional.

The Group’s definition of exceptional items, together with further
details of adjustments made during the period, is provided in note
3 and note 5.

INDEFINITE LIFE BRANDS
The brand of Cumberland Farms is a well-known long-standing
brand in the USA and as a result of the reputation and association
with quality there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which
the asset is expected to generate net cash inflows. The brand is
therefore deemed to have an indefinite useful economic life and
the value of $337m will not be amortised. Details of intangible
assets are set out in note 16.

**Key sources of estimation uncertainty**
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources
of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a
significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are
discussed below.

IMPAIRMENT OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND
INTANGIBLES
Property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount may not be recoverable. In performing the review, assets
are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that is
largely independent of the Group’s other cash-generating streams.

Goodwill and indefinite life brands are reviewed for impairment
on an annual basis. The Group allocates goodwill to groups of
cash-generating units, where each country represents a group of
cash-generating units.


When a review for impairment is conducted, the recoverable
amounts for cash-generating units are the higher of fair value less
cost of disposal, and value-in-use. In assessing value-in-use, the
estimated future cash flows (which is a key source of estimation
uncertainty) are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time
value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the
estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.

Fair value is determined based on forecast earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (“EBITDA”, which is a
non-IFRS measure) and EBITDA valuation multiples of comparable
corporations and market transactions. For the purpose of the
impairment test, management uses estimates and assumptions
to establish the fair value of the Group’s cash-generating units.
If these assumptions and estimates prove to be incorrect, the
carrying value of the goodwill may be overstated.

**Other sources of estimation uncertainty**
FAIR VALUES IN BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
In assessing the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in
business combinations, estimation is used in a number of areas. To
assist in this work, the Group engages external valuation experts to
assess the fair value. Management then review the work and assess
the results. Details of the fair value of the acquired assets and
liabilities are detailed in note 35.

**Measurement of provisions**
The Group has recognised provisions totalling $839m (2020:
$983m) for environmental costs, dilapidations and onerous
contracts.

The provision for environmental costs and dilapidations is based
on the current cost escalated at an inflation rate and discounted
at a risk-free rate. The provision for onerous contracts is based on
the lower of our current estimates of cost of fulfilling the contracts
and any compensation or penalties and discounting to present
value when the effect of time value of money is material. These
provisions are estimates and the actual costs and timing of future
cash flows are dependent on future events and market conditions.

Because actual outflows can differ from estimates due to changes
in laws, regulations, prices and conditions, the carrying amounts of
provisions are regularly reviewed and adjusted to take account of
such changes.

Any difference between expectations and the actual future liability
will be accounted for in the period when such determination is
made. The carrying amount of provisions will be impacted by
changes in the discount rate. Details of provisions are set out in
note 27.

**Presentation of related party transactions**
A number of related party transactions have occurred in the
year, including an amount reimbursed to cover the finance costs
incurred by the Group for the financing obtained for the aborted
acquisition of the Asda Forecourt Business. The value of this
reimbursement was $41m, which has been presented as finance
income on the basis of the commercial rationale which supports
the reimbursement. The related external financing costs have been
presented as finance costs. The Group’s related party transactions
and balances, which includes additional information on this
reimbursement and the commercial rationale are detailed in
note 37.

The balances are analysed as follows:

**2021** 2020

**$m** $m

Current **(134)** (154)

Non Current **(705)** (829)

**(839)** (983)

**Property provisions (December 31, 2021: $438m; 2020: $484m)**
Property provisions comprise asset retirement obligation provisions, environmental provisions for remediation works at petrol filling
stations (“PFS”), debranding provisions and dilapidation provisions. The nature of the provisions and the judgements applied in
determining the amount to be provided are described in further detail below:

**• Asset retirement obligation (‘dismantling’) (December 31, 2021: $302m; 2020: $338m)**
Dismantling provisions relate to sites for which the Group only has a right to operate the site for a number of years under a lease
arrangement with a third party. After the right to use has expired, the Group is obliged to dismantle all assets on the specific site
and to restore the site to its original condition. Amounts provided are based on prior experience of costs incurred. The provision is
expected to be utilised in the medium to long term.

**• Environmental restoration (December 31, 2021: $97m; 2020: $114m)**
Environmental protection requirements for remediation works at petrol filling stations (“PFS”) vary by country and are regulated by
different agencies in each country. In all countries, a provision is made in full when a liability is identified and assessed. A provision
is recognised for the present value of costs to be incurred for the restoration of sites, based on third-party reports. The provision is
expected to be utilised in the medium to long term.

**• Debranding (December 31, 2021: $10m; 2020: $12m)**
Debranding provisions relate to sites where, on termination of existing contracts with fuel suppliers and brand licensors, the Group
is obliged to debrand, at its own cost, sites and motorway concessions. Amounts provided are based on prior experience of costs
incurred. The provision is expected to be utilised in the medium to long term.

**• Dilapidations (December 31, 2021: $29m; 2020: $20m)**
Dilapidation provisions relate to sites acquired on leases which contain clauses under which the Group has to make good dilapidations
or other damage which occurs to the property during the course of the lease or restore the property to a specified condition.
Amounts provided are based on prior experience of costs incurred. The provision is expected to be utilised in the medium to long
term.

**Unfavourable contracts (December 31, 2021: $261m; 2020: $302m)**
The amount provided represents unfavourable contracts acquired through business combinations in which the business was committed
to a contract with less favourable cash inflows/outflows than those which could have been obtained in an equivalent contract negotiated
at arm’s length as at the date of acquisition. Amounts provided for relate to the difference between the estimated fair value of the
contract at acquisition date and the estimated fair value of an equivalent contract negotiated on the acquisition date. The provision
is expected to be utilised in the medium to long term. Post year end, the Group resolved their Federal Court proceedings with Ampol
Limited. In resolving the dispute, the parties agreed updated commercial terms, which will result in a decrease in the carrying value of
provisions by $46m in the year ended December 31, 2022. See note 36 for further details.

**Other provisions (December 31, 2021: $140m; 2020: $197m)**
Other provisions relate primarily to legal claims, restructuring costs, onerous contracts and obligations to retailers/dealers who operate
sites in the Group. The nature of the provisions and the judgements applied in determining the amount to be provided are described in
further detail below:

**• Legal claims (December 31, 2021: $24m; 2020: $33m)**
The amount provided primarily represents several legal claims brought against the Group (i) by retailers, wholesalers, suppliers and
sub-lessees for wrongful termination of contracts and/or alleged contractual breach, or (ii) by landlords for an amendment of the
rent, or (iii) by customers and employees claiming for injury or damages. Based on prior experience with such claims, the expected
settlement date is uncertain and can extend for several years. Amounts provided for are based on estimated outcomes of the claims
determined by internal and external legal counsel. The provision is expected to be utilised in the medium to long term.

**• Retailer/dealer contract premiums (December 31, 2021: $22m; 2020: $28m)**
The Group provides for expected outflows to reflect the accumulated rights of the retailer/dealer. In certain jurisdictions, where the
Group has an arrangement for a third-party retailer/dealer to operate a site, the third party is legally or contractually entitled to certain
benefits relating to the length of their service. The Group provides for the expected outflows arising from this obligation on the basis
of the award accumulated at the reporting date. The provision is expected to be utilised in the medium to long term.

**• Other (December 31, 2021: $94m; 2020: $136m)**
The Group has a number of other smaller provisions which make up this total balance. This balance includes items such as expected
costs for the Group’s committed restructuring activity, insurance excess reserves, and real estate transfer taxes

#### NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

For the year ended December 31, 2021

**1. GENERAL INFORMATION**
The principal activity of EG Group Limited (the ‘Company’) is as a holding company. The Company is incorporated and domiciled in the
United Kingdom. The Company is a private company limited by shares and is registered in England and Wales, and the address of the
registered office is Waterside Head Office, Haslingden Road, Guide, Blackburn, Lancashire, BB1 2FA, United Kingdom.

**2. BASIS OF PREPARATION**
The separate financial statements of the Company have been prepared on the historical cost basis, in accordance with Financial
Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework (“FRS 101”) and are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006.

The Company meets the definition of a qualifying entity under FRS 100 Application of Financial Reporting Requirements as issued by
the Financial Reporting Council.

As permitted by FRS 101, the Company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available under that standard in relation to
financial instruments, capital management, presentation of comparative information in respect of certain assets, presentation of a cash
flow statement, standards not yet effective, impairment of assets and related party transactions. Where relevant, equivalent disclosures
have been given in the Group accounts.

The Company’s financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling, its functional currency, rounded to the nearest million.

The Directors have taken advantage of the exemption available under Section 408 of the Companies Act and not presented an income
statement or a statement of comprehensive income for the Company alone.

**3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES**
**Basis of accounting**
The principal accounting policies adopted are the same as those set out in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements except as
noted below.

**Investments**
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less, where appropriate, provisions for impairment.

**Financial guarantees of subsidiary obligations**
The Company has provided financial guarantees in respect of the borrowings of certain subsidiaries. These are accounted for under IFRS
4 (rather than IFRS 9) as the Company regards such contracts as insurance for the lender against default by the borrower.

IFRS 17 ‘Insurance Contracts’ has been released but is not yet adopted by the Group. The standard is effective from the year ended
December 31, 2023 and introduces a new model for accounting for insurance contracts. We are assessing the impact of IFRS 17 on
existing arrangements" and this will be disclosed in the next annual report.

**4. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY**
In the application of the Company’s accounting policies, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions
about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated
assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these
estimates.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the
period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the
revision affects both current and future periods.

There are no significant accounting judgements applied in preparation of the Company’s financial statements.

**Key sources of estimation uncertainty**
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a
significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are
discussed below.

**Impairment of investments**
The carrying amounts of the Company’s investments are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any
indication of impairment in accordance with the accounting policy set out in note 3 of the consolidated financial statements. Note 15
in the consolidated financial statements details the assumptions used together with an analysis of the sensitivity to changes in key
assumptions.
