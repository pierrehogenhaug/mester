Prospective purchasers that are QIBs are hereby notified that the seller of the securities will be relying on the exemption from the provisions of Section 5 of the U.S. Securities Act pursuant to Rule 144A. You are reminded that the attached Offering Memorandum has been delivered to you on the basis that you are a person into whose possession the attached Offering Memorandum may be lawfully delivered in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which you are located and you may not, nor are you authorized to, deliver the attached Offering Memorandum to any other person. The materials relating to the offering do not constitute, and may not be used in connection with, an offer or solicitation in any place where offers or solicitations are not permitted by law. If a jurisdiction requires that the offering be made by a licensed broker or dealer and the initial purchasers or any affiliate of the initial purchasers is a licensed broker or dealer in that jurisdiction, the offering shall be deemed to be made by the initial purchasers or such affiliate on behalf of Silgan Holdings Inc. in such jurisdiction. The attached Offering Memorandum has been sent to you in an electronic form. You are reminded that documents transmitted via this medium may be altered or changed during the process of electronic transmission and consequently none of the initial purchasers set forth in the attached Offering Memorandum (collectively, the “Initial Purchasers”) or any person who controls any Initial Purchaser, or any of their respective directors, officers, employees or agents or affiliates of any such person accepts any liability or responsibility whatsoever in respect of any difference between the Offering Memorandum distributed to you in electronic format and the hard copy version available to you on request from the Initial Purchasers. The notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (the “EEA”) or the United Kingdom (the “UK”). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2016/97 (the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended, the “Prospectus Regulation”). Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA or in the UK has been prepared, and therefore offering or selling the notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA or the UK may be unlawful under the PRIIPS Regulation. The attached Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of notes in any Member State of the EEA or in the UK will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of notes. The attached Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Regulation. References to Regulations or Directives include, in relation to the UK, those Regulations or Directives as they form part of UK domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 or have been implemented in UK domestic law, as appropriate. Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the Euro notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Euro notes is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Euro notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Euro notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Euro notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels. The attached Offering Memorandum is for distribution only to persons who (i) have professional experience in matters relating to investments and who qualify as investment professionals within the meaning of Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005 (as ----- worth companies, unincorporated associations etc.”) of the Financial Promotion Order, (iii) are outside the United Kingdom, or (iv) are persons to whom an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, as amended (“FSMA”)) in connection with the issue or sale of any notes may otherwise lawfully be communicated or caused to be communicated (all such persons together being referred to as “relevant persons”). The attached Offering Memorandum is directed only at relevant persons and must not be acted on or relied on by persons who are not relevant persons. Any investment or investment activity to which the attached Offering Memorandum relates is available only to relevant persons and will be engaged in only with relevant persons. ----- ----- e a y O e g e o a du St ct y Co de t a # Catalent Pharma Solutions, Inc. ###### an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of # Catalent, Inc. ## € 450,000,000 % Senior Notes due 2028 ###### Interest payable and #### Issue price: % We are offering €450,000,000 aggregate principal amount of % senior notes due 2028 (the “notes”).

Therefore, although Catalent, Inc. is not an issuer or a guarantor of the notes, its consolidated revenues and results of operations substantially reflect the revenues and results of operations of Catalent Pharma Solutions, Inc. and its subsidiaries. Thus, our “2019 Form 10-K” and our “2020 Form 10-Q” refer, respectively, to the Catalent, Inc. Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 and the Catalent, Inc. Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2019 (collectively, our “SEC Reports”). Also for these reasons, unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, “we,” “our,” “us” and “the Company” refer to Catalent Pharma Solutions, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, except “we,” “our,” “us” and “the Company” refer to Catalent, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries as of the periods presented with respect to the historical financial information and other data presented in this offering memorandum, including under the headings “Summary—Summary Historical and Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Data,” “Capitalization,” and “Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Statements,” as well as the historical financial and other information incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum, including the audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements iv ----- including the notes thereto and the information under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the 2019 Form 10-K and 2020 Form 10-Q, which information is incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum. Our historical financial information included or incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum does not reflect the results of operations of Paragon Bioservices, Inc. (now Catalent Maryland, Inc., “Paragon” or “Catalent Maryland”) for any period prior to May 17, 2019, the date of its acquisition by the Company (the “Paragon Acquisition”). In addition, unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, the “Issuer” refers to Catalent Pharma Solutions, Inc., not including any of its subsidiaries, and “Catalent” refers to Catalent, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. We do not intend to register the notes pursuant to a registration statement under the Securities Act. If the notes had been registered under the Securities Act, we would have been required to make changes to the financial and other information included and incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum. In particular, this offering memorandum would have needed to include a consolidating guarantor footnote in the financial statements of Catalent, Inc. as required by Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and such footnote is not included in the financial statements of Catalent, Inc. incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum and will not be included in the financial statements of Catalent, Inc. following the consummation of this offering of the notes. The calculations of the U.S. dollar equivalent amounts in this offering memorandum are based on the noon buying rates in the City of New York as certified by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as of the dates indicated.",N/A,as_expected,2020,156
322_2,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,3092,USE OF NON-GAAP MEASURES,3092.1,,3092.1.1,,"Management measures operating performance based on consolidated earnings from operations before interest expense, expense/(benefit) for income taxes, and depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA from operations”). EBITDA from operations is not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”), is not a measure of operating income, operating performance, or liquidity presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and is subject to important limitations. We believe that the presentation of EBITDA from operations enhances an investor’s understanding of our financial performance. We believe this measure is a useful financial metric to assess our operating performance from period to period by excluding certain items that we believe are not representative of our core business and use this measure for business planning purposes. In addition, given the significant investments that we have made in the past in property, plant, and equipment, depreciation and amortization expenses represent a meaningful portion of our cost structure. We believe that EBITDA from operations will provide investors with a useful tool for assessing the comparability between periods of our ability to generate cash from operations sufficient to pay taxes, to service debt, and to undertake capital expenditures because it eliminates depreciation and amortization expense. We present EBITDA from operations in order to provide supplemental information that we consider relevant for the readers of the consolidated financial statements, and such information is not meant to replace or supersede U.S. GAAP measures. We evaluate the performance of our segments based on segment earnings before noncontrolling interest, other (income)/expense, impairments, restructuring costs, interest expense, income tax expense/(benefit), and depreciation and amortization (“Segment EBITDA”). Moreover, under the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities (the “Credit Agreement”), the indenture (the “2024 Indenture”) governing the 4.75% Senior Notes due 2024 issued on December 9, 2016 (the “Euro 2024 Notes”), the indenture (the “2026 Indenture”) governing the 4.875% Senior Notes due 2026 issued on October 18, 2016 (the “USD 2026 Notes”), the indenture (the “2027 Indenture” and together with the 2024 Indenture and the 2026 Indenture, the “Existing Indentures”) governing the 5.000% Senior Notes due 2027 issued on June 27, 2019 (the “USD 2027 Notes” and together with the Euro 2024 Notes and the USD 2026 Notes, the “Existing Senior Notes”), and the indenture that will govern the notes, our ability to engage in certain activities, such as incurring certain additional indebtedness, making certain investments, and paying certain dividends, is tied to ratios based on Adjusted EBITDA (which is v ----- defined as “Consolidated EBITDA” in the Credit Agreement and “EBITDA” in the Existing Indentures and in the indenture that will govern the notes). Adjusted EBITDA is based on the definitions in the Credit Agreement, in the Existing Indentures, and in the indenture that will govern the notes, is not defined under U.S. GAAP, and is subject to important limitations. We have included the calculations of Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented. In calculating Adjusted EBITDA, on a pro forma basis, we give pro forma effect to the Paragon Acquisition as if the Paragon Acquisition had occurred at the beginning of the applicable period presented. Certain of these pro forma effects are based on estimates and assumptions, all of which we believe have a reasonable basis, although actual results could differ from those estimates and the assumed facts may not be realized. Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of EBITDA from operations and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. EBITDA from operations and Adjusted EBITDA have important limitations as analytical tools, and investors should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. For example, EBITDA from continuing operations and Adjusted EBITDA: - exclude certain tax obligations that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; - do not reflect any cash capital expenditure requirement for the assets being depreciated and amortized that may have to be replaced in the future; - do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; and - do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements, necessary to service our debt interest and principal payments. In calculating Adjusted EBITDA, we add back certain non-cash, non-recurring, and other items that are included in EBITDA from operations and net earnings, as required by various covenants in the Credit Agreement, the Existing Indentures, and the indenture that will govern the notes. Adjusted EBITDA, among other things: - does not include non-cash stock-based employee compensation expense and certain other non-cash charges; - does not include cash and non-cash restructuring, severance, and relocation costs incurred to realize future cost savings and enhance our operations; and - includes estimated cost savings that have not yet been fully reflected in our results. In applying Adjusted EBITDA to determine our ability to engage in the activities described above under the Credit Agreement, the Existing Indentures, and the indenture that will govern the notes, we are permitted to make further pro forma adjustments. As exchange rates are an important factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons, we believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to reported results helps improve investors’ ability to understand our operating results and evaluate our performance in comparison to prior periods. Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-overperiod. We use results on a constant currency basis as one measure to evaluate our performance. In this offering memorandum, we calculate constant currency by calculating current-year results using prior-year foreign currency exchange rates. We generally refer to such amounts calculated on a constant currency basis as excluding the impact of foreign exchange. These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not measures of performance presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Unless specifically indicated, we provide the results we present in this offering memorandum, including EBITDA from operations and Adjusted EBITDA, on both historical and pro forma bases, taking the impact of foreign exchange into account and not on a constant-currency basis. vi -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,156
322_2,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,7,FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS,7.1,,7.1.1,,"This offering memorandum contains or incorporates by reference forward-looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to, among other things, our operations and financial performance. Forwardlooking statements include all statements that are not historical facts. In some cases, you can identify these forward-looking statements by the use of words such as “outlook,” “believes,” “expects,” “potential,” “continues,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “seeks,” “predicts,” “intends,” “plans,” “estimates,” “anticipates,” “future,” “forward,” “sustain” or the negative version of these words or other comparable words. These statements are based on assumptions and assessments made by our management in light of their experience and their perception of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments, and other factors they believe to be appropriate. Such forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, there are or will be important factors that could cause actual outcomes or results to differ materially from those indicated in these statements. Some of the factors that may cause actual results, developments and business decisions to differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those described under the sections entitled “Risk Factors” in this offering memorandum and our SEC Reports and the following: - We participate in a highly competitive market, and increased competition may adversely affect our business. - The demand for our offerings depends in part on our customers’ research and development and the clinical and market success of their products. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be harmed if our customers spend less on, or are less successful in, these activities. - We are subject to product and other liability risks that could exceed our anticipated costs or adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and cash flows. - Failure to comply with existing and future regulatory requirements could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition or result in claims from customers. - Failure to provide quality offerings to our customers could have an adverse effect on our business and subject us to regulatory actions or costly litigation. - The services and offerings we provide are highly exacting and complex, and, if we encounter problems providing the services or support required, our business could suffer. - Our global operations are subject to economic, political, and regulatory risks, including the risks of changing regulatory standards or changing interpretations of existing standards, that could affect the profitability of our operations or require costly changes to our procedures. - The exit of the United Kingdom (the “U.K.”) from the European Union could have future adverse effects on our operations, revenues, and costs, and therefore our profitability. - If we do not enhance our existing or introduce new technology or service offerings in a timely manner, our offerings may become obsolete over time, customers may not buy our offerings, and our revenue and profitability may decline. - We and our customers depend on patents, copyrights, trademarks, know-how, trade secrets, and other forms of intellectual property protections, but these protections may not be adequate. - Our offerings or our customers’ products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties. - Our future results of operations are subject to fluctuations in the costs, availability, and suitability of the components of the products we manufacture, including active pharmaceutical ingredients, excipients, purchased components, and raw materials. vii ----- - Changes in market access or healthcare reimbursement for our customers’ products in the United States (“U.S.”) or internationally, including possible changes to the U.S. Affordable Care Act, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition by affecting demand for our offerings or the financial health of our customers. - As a global enterprise, fluctuations in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar, our reporting currency, against other currencies could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and results of operations. - Tax legislative or regulatory initiatives, new interpretations or developments concerning existing tax laws, or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. - Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards, ex-U.S. tax credit carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited. - Changes to the estimated future profitability of the business may require that we establish an additional valuation allowance against all or some portion of our net U.S. deferred tax assets. - We depend on key personnel whose continued employment and engagement at current levels cannot be assured. - We use advanced information and communication systems to run our operations, compile and analyze financial and operational data, and communicate among our employees, customers, and counter-parties, and the risks generally associated with information and communications systems could adversely affect our results of operations. We are continuously working to install new, and upgrade existing, systems and provide employee awareness training around phishing, malware, and other cyber security risks to enhance the protections available to us, but such protections may be inadequate to address malicious attacks or inadvertent compromises of data security. - We engage, from time to time in acquisitions and other transactions, including the recent acquisitions of the facility in Anagni, Italy and of Masthercell Global Inc. (“MaSTherCell”), that may complement or expand our business or divest of non-strategic businesses or assets. We may not be able to complete transactions we agree to do, and such transactions, if executed, pose significant risks, including risks relating to our ability to successfully and efficiently integrate acquisitions or execute on dispositions and realize anticipated benefits therefrom. The failure to execute or realize the full benefits from any such transaction could have a negative effect on our operations. - Gene and cell therapies are relatively new and still-developing modes of treatment, dependent on cutting-edge technologies, and our customers’ gene and cell therapies may be perceived as unsafe or may result in unforeseen adverse events. Negative public opinion, continuing research, or increased regulatory scrutiny of gene or cell therapies and their financial cost may damage public perception of the safety, utility, or efficacy of gene or cell therapies and harm our customers’ ability to conduct their business or obtain regulatory approvals for their gene or cell therapy products, and thereby have an indirect, adverse effect on our gene and cell therapy offerings. - We are subject to environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations, which could increase our costs and restrict our operations in the future. - We are subject to labor and employment laws and regulations, which could increase our costs and restrict our operations in the future. - Certain of our pension plans are underfunded, and additional cash contributions we may make to increase the funding level will reduce the cash available for our business, such as the payment of our interest expense. - Our substantial leverage could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or in our industry, expose us to interest viii ----- rate-risk to the extent of our variable-rate debt, and prevent us from meeting our obligations under our indebtedness, including the notes. - Despite our high indebtedness level, we and our subsidiaries will still be able to incur significant additional debt, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness. - Our debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business. - Despite the limitations in our debt agreements, we retain the ability to take certain actions that may interfere with our ability timely to pay our substantial indebtedness. - We may use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to market risks from changes in interest rates on our variable-rate indebtedness or changes in currency exchange rates, and any such instrument may expose us to risks related to counterparty credit worthiness or non-performance of these instruments. We caution you that the risks, uncertainties, and other factors referenced above may not contain all of the risks, uncertainties, and other factors that are important to you. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will realize the results, benefits, or developments that we expect or anticipate or, even if substantially realized, that they will result in the consequences or affect us or our business in the way expected. There can be no assurance that (i) we have correctly measured or identified all of the factors affecting our business or the extent of these factors’ likely impact, (ii) the available information with respect to these factors on which such analysis is based is complete or accurate, (iii) such analysis is correct, or (iv) our strategy, which is based in part on this analysis, will be successful. The factors above should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with the other cautionary statements that are included or incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum. All forward-looking statements included or incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum apply only as of the date of this offering memorandum or as of the date they were made, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments, or otherwise, except as required by law. ix ----- [THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK] -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,156

322_2,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,1161,OUR COMPANY,1161.1,,1161.1.1,,"We are the leading global provider of advanced delivery technologies and development solutions for drugs, biologics, and consumer health products. Our oral, injectable, gene and cell therapy, and respiratory delivery technologies address the full diversity of the pharmaceutical industry, including small molecules, protein and gene and cell therapy biologics, and consumer health products. Through our extensive capabilities and deep expertise in product development, we help our customers take products to market faster, including nearly half of new drug products approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in the last decade. Our advanced delivery technology platforms, which include those in our Softgel and Oral Technologies, Biologics, and Oral and Specialty Delivery segments, our proven formulation, manufacturing, and regulatory expertise, and our broad and deep intellectual property enable our customers to develop more products and better treatments for patients and consumers. Across both development and delivery, our commitment to reliably supply our customers’ and their patients’ needs is the foundation for the value we provide; annually, we produce approximately 73 billion doses for nearly 7,000 customer products, or approximately 1 in every 20 doses of such products taken each year by patients and consumers around the world. We believe that, through our investments in growth-enabling capacity and capabilities, our ongoing focus on operational and quality excellence, the sales of existing customer products, the introduction of new customer products, our innovation activities and patents, and our entry into new markets, we will continue to benefit from attractive and differentiated margins and realize the growth potential from these areas. We continue to invest in our sales and marketing activities, leading to growth in the number of active development programs for our customers. This has further enhanced our extensive, long-duration relationships and long-term contracts with a broad and diverse range of industry-leading customers. In fiscal 2019, we conducted business with 83 of the top 100 branded drug marketers, 21 of the top 25 generics marketers, 23 of the top 25 biologics marketers, and 21 of the top 25 consumer health marketers globally. Selected key customers include Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis, Roche, and Teva. We have many long-standing relationships with our customers, particularly in advanced delivery technologies, where we tend to follow a prescription molecule through its lifecycle, from the development and launch of the original brand prescription through the switch to generic, biosimilar, or over-the-counter products. Our relationship with the party holding the marketing rights to a prescription pharmaceutical product will often last many years, in several cases, nearly two decades or more, extending from pre-clinical development through the end of the product’s life cycle. We serve customers who require innovative product development, superior quality, advanced manufacturing, and skilled technical services to support their development and marketed product needs. Our broad and diverse range of technologies closely integrates with our customers’ molecules and other active ingredients to yield final formulations and dose forms, and this generally results in the inclusion of Catalent in our customers’ prescription product regulatory filings. Both of these factors frequently translate to long-duration supply relationships at an individual product level. We believe our customers value us because our depth of development solutions and advanced delivery technologies, intellectual property, consistent and reliable supply, geographic reach, and substantial expertise 1 ----- enable us to create a broad range of business and product solutions that can be customized to fit their individual needs. Today we employ more than 2,400 scientists and technicians and hold more than 1,300 patents and patent applications in advanced delivery, drug and biologics formulation, and manufacturing. The aim of our offerings is to allow our customers to bring more products to market faster, and to develop and market differentiated new products that improve patient outcomes. We believe our leading market position and diversity of customers, offerings, regulatory categories, products, and geographies reduce our exposure to potential strategic and product shifts within the industry. We provide a number of proprietary, differentiated technologies, products, and service offerings to our customers across our advanced delivery technologies and development solutions platforms. The core technologies within our advanced delivery technologies platform include softgel capsules, our Zydis orally dissolving tablets, blow-fill-seal unit-dose liquids, adeno-associated virus vectors, genetically modified cells, and a range of other oral, injectable, and respiratory delivery technologies. The technologies and service offerings within our development solutions platform span the drug development process, ranging from our OptiForm Solution Suite for enhancement of bioavailability and other characteristics of early-stage molecules, and Gene Product Expression (GPEx) and SMARTag platforms for development of biologics and antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), to formulation, analytical services, early-stage clinical development, and clinical trials supply, including our unique FastChain demand-led clinical supply solution. Our offerings serve a critical need in the development and manufacturing of difficult-to-formulate products across a number of product types. We have advanced our technologies and grown our service offerings over more than 85 years through internal development, strategic alliances, in-licensing, and acquisitions. We initially introduced our softgel capsule technology in the 1930s and have continued to expand our range of new, technologically enhanced offerings. Since fiscal 2013, we have launched OptiShell, OptiMelt, Zydis Nano, Zydis Bio, OptiPact, the OptiForm Solution Suite, and our FastChain demand-led clinical supply solution. Since then, our customers have obtained regulatory approval for the first-to-market product using our OptiShell technology. We have also augmented our portfolio through acquisitions. In fiscal 2015, we added an ADC business through the completion of our acquisition of Redwood Bioscience Inc. in October 2014; and extended our particle engineering capabilities via our November 2014 acquisition of Micron Technologies. In fiscal 2017, we expanded our early development capabilities, including the addition of spray drying technology into our drug formulation and delivery technologies, through the acquisition of Pharmatek Laboratories, Inc. (“Pharmatek”) in September 2016, and we expanded our softgel development and manufacturing network via the February 2017 acquisition of Accucaps Industries Limited. In fiscal 2018, we acquired Cook Pharmica LLC (now named Catalent Indiana, LLC, “Catalent Indiana”) in order to enhance our biologics capabilities. In fiscal 2019, we acquired Juniper Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which extends to the U.K. the geographic reach of the early development capabilities we gained through Pharmatek, and Catalent Maryland, adding advanced gene therapy development and manufacturing capabilities to our biologics business and enhancing our end-to-end integrated biopharmaceutical solutions for customers. Earlier in the current fiscal year, fiscal 2020, we acquired additional facilities, personnel, and equipment for our gene therapy development and manufacturing business from Novavax, Inc. and a biologics, sterile, and oral solid dose product manufacturing and packaging facility in Anagni, Italy from BristolMyers Squibb Company. Recently, we acquired MaSTherCell, a leading contract development and manufacturing organization focused on genetically modified cell therapy development and manufacturing (the “MaSTherCell Acquisition”). See “—Recent Developments—MaSTherCell Acquisition.” In large part due to our acquisitions of Catalent Indiana and Catalent Maryland, revenue contributions from our biologics business have grown from approximately 10% in fiscal 2014 to 29% in fiscal 2019. We believe our own internal innovation, supplemented by current and future external partnerships and acquisitions, will continue to strengthen and extend our leadership positions in the delivery and development of drugs, biologics, including gene and cell therapies, and consumer health products. 2 ----- In fiscal 2019, we generated net revenue of $2,518.0 million, net earnings of $137.4 million, and Adjusted EBITDA of $599.6 million. On a pro forma basis, after giving effect to the Paragon Acquisition as if it had occurred on July 1, 2018, in fiscal 2019 we would have generated net revenue of $2,638.8 million, net earnings of $116.5 million, and Adjusted EBITDA of $627.4 million. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, we generated net revenue of $2,729.3 million, net earnings of $148.4 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $651.8 million. Adjusted EBITDA is not defined under U.S. GAAP and is subject to important limitations. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net earnings, the closest U.S. GAAP measure, see “—Summary Historical and Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Data.” For a description of our business, financial condition, results of operations, and other important information regarding us, we refer you to our filings with the SEC incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum.

322_2,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Acquisitions,13.1.1,"We engage from time to time in acquisitions and other transactions that may complement or expand our business, such as the Paragon Acquisition, the acquisition of the facility in Anagni, Italy, and the MaSTherCell Acquisition. We may not be able to complete such transactions, and such transactions, if executed, pose significant risks, including risks relating to our ability to successfully and efficiently integrate acquisitions or execute on dispositions and realize anticipated benefits therefrom. The failure to execute or realize the full benefits from any such transaction could have a negative effect on our operations.","Our future success may depend in part on opportunities to buy or otherwise acquire rights to other facilities, businesses, or technologies or enter into joint ventures or otherwise enter into strategic arrangements with business partners that could complement, enhance, or expand our current business or offerings and services or that might otherwise offer us growth opportunities. We may face competition from other firms in pursuing acquisitions and similar transactions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry. Our ability to complete transactions may also be limited by applicable antitrust and trade regulation laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we or the operations or assets we seek to acquire carry on business. To the extent that we are successful in making acquisitions, we may expend substantial amounts of cash, incur debt, or assume lossmaking divisions as consideration. We may not be able to complete a desired transaction for reasons including, but not limited to, a failure to secure financing or to satisfy any condition precedent. Any acquisition that we are able to identify and complete may involve a number of risks, including, but not limited to, the diversion of management’s attention to integrate the acquired business, assets or joint ventures, the possible adverse effects on our operating results during the integration process, the potential loss of customers or employees in connection with the acquisition, delays or reduction in realizing expected synergies, the inaccurate assessment of potential liabilities, unexpected liabilities, and our potential inability to achieve our intended objectives for the transaction. In addition, we may be unable to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures, and policies, and this may lead to operational inefficiencies.",N/A,as_expected,2020,156

The unaudited pro forma financial data has been derived from our audited financial statements and Paragon’s audited and unaudited financial statements, and reflects assumptions and adjustments that are based upon estimates that are subject to change. For example, the process for estimating the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities requires the use of judgment in determining the appropriate assumptions and estimates. These estimates 15 ----- may be revised as additional information becomes available and as additional analyses are performed. Accordingly, the final acquisition accounting adjustments may differ materially from the pro forma adjustments reflected in this offering memorandum.

322_2,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.2,Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness,13.2.1,"Our substantial leverage could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or in our industry or to deploy capital to grow our business, expose us to interest-rate risk to the extent of our variable-rate debt and prevent us from meeting our obligations under the notes.","We are highly leveraged. As of December 31, 2019, on an as-adjusted basis after giving effect to the Transactions, we had approximately $2,969.9 million (U.S. dollar equivalent) of total indebtedness outstanding, consisting of $1,268.9 million (U.S. dollar equivalent) of secured indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities, $1,428.4 million (U.S. dollar equivalent) of senior unsecured indebtedness, including $490.8 million (U.S. dollar equivalent) representing the notes, in each case inclusive of unamortized debt issuance costs, $95.9 million representing the accreted value of the remaining Deferred Purchase Consideration related to the acquisition of Catalent Indiana, and $176.7 million of capital lease and other obligations. In addition, we had an additional $543.3 million of unutilized capacity and $6.7 million of outstanding letters of credit under our revolving credit facility, all of which would be secured. Our high degree of leverage could have important consequences for us, including: - increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic, industry, or competitive developments; - exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates because certain of our borrowings, including borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities, are at variable rates of interest; - exposing us to the risk of fluctuations in exchange rates because the notes will be denominated in euros and we may engage in currency swaps with respect to certain borrowings, including under our senior secured term loan facilities; - making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, including the notes, and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt instruments, including restrictive covenants and borrowing conditions, could result in one or more events of default under the indenture that will govern the notes and the agreements governing such other indebtedness; - restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or capital investments or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures; - limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product development, debt service requirements, acquisitions, and general corporate or other purposes; and - limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less highly leveraged and who, therefore, may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage prevents us from exploiting. Our cash interest paid was $102.5 million, $83.2 million, and $80.8 million for fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. On an as-adjusted basis after giving effect to the Transactions, assuming that our revolving credit facility is undrawn and LIBOR is above any applicable minimum floor, each one-eighth percent change in interest rates would result in a change of approximately $1.2 million in annual interest expense on the indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019.

Although the indenture that will govern the notes, the Credit Agreement, and the Existing Indentures contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and, under certain circumstances, the amount of indebtedness that we may incur while remaining in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. As of December 31, 2019, on an as-adjusted basis after giving effect to the Transactions, we had approximately $543.3 million available to us for borrowing, subject to certain conditions, from our revolving credit facility. If new debt is added to our subsidiaries’ existing debt levels, the risks associated with debt we currently face would increase.",N/A,as_expected,2020,156
322_2,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.2,Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness,13.2.3,Our debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business.,"The indenture that will govern the notes, the Credit Agreement, and the Existing Indentures contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. These covenants limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to, among other things: - incur additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred stock; - pay certain dividends on, repurchase, or make distributions in respect of capital stock or make other restricted payments; - pay distributions from restricted subsidiaries; - issue or sell capital stock of restricted subsidiaries; - guarantee certain indebtedness; - make certain investments; - sell or exchange certain assets; - enter into transactions with affiliates; - create certain liens; and - consolidate, merge, or transfer all or substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under one or more of these agreements, including as a result of cross-default provisions, and, in the case of the revolving credit facility, permit the lenders to cease making loans to us. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the indenture that will govern the notes, the Credit Agreement, or the Existing Indentures, the noteholders or lenders, as the case may be, could elect to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable and, in the case of the senior secured credit facilities, to terminate all commitments to extend further credit. Such actions by those noteholders or lenders, as the case may be, could cause cross-defaults under our other indebtedness. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. We pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral under the senior secured credit facilities. If the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we may not have sufficient assets to repay the senior secured credit facilities as well as our unsecured indebtedness, including the notes. In addition, our senior secured credit facilities include other and more restrictive covenants and restrict our ability to prepay our other indebtedness, including the notes. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control. 17 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,156

Such instruments may result in economic losses if, for example, prevailing interest rates decline to a point lower than any applicable fixed-rate commitment. Any such swap will expose us to credit-related risks that, if realized could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2020,156
322_2,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.3,Risks Relating to the Notes,13.3.1,"We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness, including the notes, and we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.","Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, including the notes. On an as-adjusted basis, after giving effect to the Transactions and the Interest Payment Adjustments, our cash interest paid for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 would have been $114.8 million and a one-eighth percentage change in the assumed interest rate would correspondingly change cash interest paid by $0.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness, including the notes. On an as-adjusted basis, after giving effect to the Transactions, the revolving credit facility and the euro-denominated term loans under our senior secured credit facilities will mature in 2024, the USD 2026 Notes and the U.S. dollar-denominated term loans under our senior secured credit facilities will mature in 2026, and the USD 2027 Notes will mature in 2027, all prior to the maturity of the notes. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments and the indenture that will govern the notes may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. In addition, any failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness, attract future business, or procure needed inputs.",N/A,as_expected,2020,156

If we are declared bankrupt or insolvent, or if we default under our senior secured credit facilities, the lenders could declare all indebtedness outstanding thereunder due and payable. If we were unable to repay them, the lenders could foreclose on the pledged assets to the exclusion of holders of the notes, even if an event of default exists under the indenture that will govern the notes. Furthermore, if the lenders foreclose and sell the pledged equity interests in any subsidiary guarantor under the notes, then that guarantor will be released from its guarantee of the notes immediately. In any such event, because the notes will not be secured by any of our assets or the equity interests in subsidiary guarantors, it is possible that there would be no assets remaining from which 18 ----- your claims could be satisfied or, if any assets remained, they might be insufficient to satisfy your claims in full. See “Description of Other Indebtedness.” As of December 31, 2019, on an as-adjusted basis after giving effect to the Transactions, we had approximately $1,268.9 million (U.S. dollar equivalent) of senior secured indebtedness, which is indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities, and the right to borrow $543.3 million under our revolving credit facility (all of which would be secured), after giving effect to $6.7 million of outstanding letters of credit, subject to certain conditions.

In addition, there may be local legal restrictions or adverse international tax consequences to us that reduce our ability to access or prevent us from accessing the assets and cash flows of non-guarantor subsidiaries.

See “Description of the Notes—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change of Control.” We may not have sufficient financial resources to purchase all of the notes that are tendered upon a Change of Control offer or, if then permitted under the indenture that will govern the notes, to redeem the notes. A failure to make the applicable change of control offer or to pay the applicable change of control purchase price when due would result in a default under the indenture that will govern the notes.

Under federal bankruptcy law and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer laws, the delivery of the notes or the guarantees could be found to be a fraudulent transfer and declared void if a court determined that we or the relevant guarantor, at the time that we or the relevant guarantor incurred the indebtedness evidenced by the note or its guarantee, as applicable, (1) delivered the note or guarantee, as applicable, with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud existing or future creditors; or (2) received less than reasonably equivalent value or did not receive fair consideration for the delivery of the note or guarantee, as applicable, and any of the following three conditions apply: - we or the guarantor was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of delivering the note or guarantee; - we or the guarantor was engaged in a business or transaction for which our or the guarantor’s remaining assets constituted unreasonably small capital; or - we or the guarantor intended to incur, or believed that we or it would incur, debts beyond our or its ability to pay such debts at maturity. In addition, any payment by us or that guarantor pursuant to the notes or its guarantee, as applicable, could be voided and required to be returned to us or the guarantor, or to a fund for the benefit of the creditors of us or the guarantor, as applicable. In any such case, the right of noteholders to receive payments in respect of the notes from us or any such guarantor, as applicable, would be effectively subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities of ours or that guarantor. 20 ----- The indenture that will govern the notes will contain a “savings clause,” which limits the liability of each guarantor on its guarantee to the maximum amount that such guarantor can incur without risk that its guarantee will be subject to avoidance as a fraudulent transfer. We cannot assure you that this limitation will protect such guarantees from fraudulent transfer challenges or, if it does, that the remaining amount due and collectible under the guarantees would suffice, if necessary, to pay the notes in full when due. In a 2009 Florida bankruptcy case, this kind of provision was found to be ineffective to protect the guarantees. If a court declares the notes or guarantees to be void, or if the notes or guarantees must be limited or voided in accordance with their terms, any claim a noteholder may make against us for amounts payable on the notes could, with respect to amounts claimed against us or the guarantors, be subordinated to our indebtedness and the indebtedness of the guarantors, including trade payables. The measures of insolvency for purposes of these fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding to determine whether a fraudulent transfer has occurred. Generally, however, we or a guarantor would be considered insolvent if: - the sum of our or its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair saleable value of all of our or its assets; - the present fair saleable value of our or its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay our or its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or - we or the guarantor could not pay our or its debts as they become due. On the basis of historical financial information, recent operating history and other factors, we believe that we and each guarantor, after giving effect to the issuance of the notes and its guarantee of the notes, respectively, will not be insolvent, will not have unreasonably small capital for the business in which we or it is engaged and will not have incurred debts beyond our or its ability to pay such debts as they mature.

Therefore, you may transfer or resell the notes in the United States only in a transaction registered under or exempt from the registration requirements of the U.S. and applicable state securities laws. By purchasing the notes, you will be deemed to have made certain acknowledgements, representations and agreements as set forth under “Notice to Investors.” The terms of the indenture governing the notes offered hereby will enable us to satisfy our financial reporting obligations under the indenture through the filing with the SEC of reports prepared by Catalent, which may also limit your ability to resell the notes pursuant to an exemption under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any state or any other jurisdiction. You should read the discussion under the heading “Notice to Investors” for further information about these transfer restrictions.

Certain of the initial purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the notes as permitted by applicable laws and regulations; however, the initial purchasers are not obligated to make a market in any of the notes and they may 21 ----- discontinue their market-making activities at any time without notice. Therefore, an active market for any of the notes may not develop or, if developed, it may not continue. The liquidity of any market for the notes will depend upon the number of holders of the notes, our performance, the market for similar securities, the interest of securities dealers in making a market in the notes and other factors. A liquid trading market may not develop for the notes. If a market develops, the notes could trade at prices that may be lower than the initial offering price of the notes. If an active market does not develop or is not maintained, the price and liquidity of the notes may be adversely affected. Historically, the market for non-investment grade debt has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the notes. The market, if any, for any of the notes may not be free from similar disruptions and any such disruptions may adversely affect the prices at which you may sell your notes. In addition, subsequent to their initial issuance, the notes may trade at a discount from their initial offering price, depending upon prevailing interest rates, the market for similar notes, our performance and other factors. Application will be made to the Authority for the listing of and permission to deal in the notes on the Exchange. There can be no assurance that the notes will be listed on the Exchange, that such permission to deal in the notes will be granted, or that such listing will be maintained. Although no assurance is made as to the liquidity of the notes as a result of the admission to trading on the Exchange, failure to be approved for listing or the delisting of the notes, as applicable, from the Exchange may have a material effect on a holder’s ability to resell the notes in the secondary market. Therefore, an active market for the notes may not develop or be maintained, which would adversely affect the market price and liquidity of the notes. In that case, the holders of the notes may not be able to sell their notes at a particular time or at a favorable price, if at all.",N/A,as_expected,2020,156

322_2,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.3,Risks Relating to the Notes,13.3.12,You may face currency exchange risks by investing in the notes.,"The notes will be denominated and payable in euros. If you measure your investment returns by reference to a currency (your “reference currency”) other than the euro, an investment in the notes entails currency exchangerelated risks due to, among other factors, possible significant changes in the value of the euro relative to your reference currency. Fluctuations in the exchange rates of currencies may arise from economic, political, and other factors over which we have no control. Depreciation of the euro against your reference currency could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to you when the return on the notes is translated into your reference currency. There may also be tax consequences for you as a result of any currency exchange gain or loss from any investment in the notes. See “Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences” for a discussion of tax consequences that may be applicable to certain U.S. Holders (as defined below). Additionally, concerns persist regarding the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency for a variety of individual countries. These concerns could lead to the re-introduction of individual currencies or the possible dissolution of the euro currency entirely. Should the euro dissolve entirely, the legal and contractual consequences for holders of euro-denominated obligations, including the notes, would be determined by laws in effect at such time. These potential developments, or market perceptions concerning these developments and related issues, could adversely affect the value of the notes. 22 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,156

An increase of $2.3 million related to the amortization of an aggregate $13.1 million of original issue discount and debt issuance costs incurred in connection with the Incremental Dollar Term Loans; iii. An increase of $22.3 million related to interest on the proceeds raised by the offering of the USD 2027 Notes; and iv. A decrease of $20.0 million related to the elimination of interest on the 2024 USD Term Loans. (c) Represents expense from amortizing intangible assets resulting from the Merger. The intangible assets include commercial customer relationships with an estimated useful life of 15 years, development customer relationships with an estimated useful life of 11 years, and trade names with an estimated useful life of 5 years, which are being amortized on a straight-line basis. The estimated useful life was determined based on a review of the period over which economic benefit is estimated to be generated as well as additional factors. Factors considered include contractual life, the period over which a majority of cash flow is expected to be generated, and management’s view based on historical experience with similar assets. Total pro forma amortization expense recorded for the year ended June 30, 2019 was $25.4 million. A 10% increase/decrease in the estimated fair value of intangibles will increase/decrease amortization by $2.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2019. (d) Represents a net adjustment to depreciation expense of $0.7 million related to the preliminary estimated fair value of the property, plant, and equipment acquired in the Merger representing an increase of $0.5 million and $0.2 million to cost of sales and selling, general, and administrative expenses, respectively. (e) Represents the elimination of interest expense due to the paydown of Paragon’s indebtedness upon the Merger of $2.5 million, which is assumed to occur on July 1, 2018. (f) Represents adjustments to amortization expense and interest expense as a result of adjusting the historical book value of Paragon’s capital leases to the preliminary estimated fair value, calculated as: i. An increase to cost of sales of $0.5 million; 32 ----- ii. An increase to selling, general, and administrative expenses of $0.2 million; and iii. An increase to interest expense, net of $1.5 million. (g) Represents the impact of Paragon’s deemed adoption of ASC 606 as of July 1, 2018, resulting in a decrease in net revenue and cost of sales of $5.6 million and $5.0 million, respectively. (h) Represents an adjustment to stock-based compensation expense of $9.2 million related to the incremental expense directly attributable to the Merger that is expected to have a recurring impact over four years and Catalent nonrecurring transaction costs of $(10.0) million directly attributable to the Transactions, which have been eliminated. (i) Represents Paragon nonrecurring transaction costs of $(56.7) million directly attributable to the Transactions, which have been eliminated. (j) Represents an adjustment to income tax expense/(benefit) of $(0.2) million resulting from tax-affecting the pro forma adjustments at the Company’s U.S. statutory tax rate of 25%, which includes the federal tax rate of 21% and state-blended rate of 4%. No further pro forma adjustment was made to this pro forma income tax benefit which reflects a release of a tax valuation allowance by Paragon which is not directly related to the Merger or the Financing Transactions. The reversal of the valuation allowance and its impact on the effective tax rate is not considered to be representative of the income taxes of the combined organization on a go-forward basis. (k) Basic and diluted net earnings per share (“EPS”) are each calculated using the two-class method by dividing adjusted pro forma net earnings by the weighted average shares outstanding and diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Pro forma net earnings are adjusted for the Series A Preferred Stock cumulative dividend and are divided by the weighted average shares of Common Stock outstanding (without assuming conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock) for purposes of calculating basic EPS. For diluted EPS, the denominator includes the weighted average number of basic shares of Common Stock and the number of additional shares of Common Stock that would have been outstanding if the potential shares of Common Stock that were dilutive had been issued, and is calculated using either the two-class, treasury stock or if-converted method, whichever is more dilutive. In computing diluted EPS, the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares of Common Stock assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all potentially dilutive shares to the extent their effect would be anti-dilutive. 33 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,156
322_2,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,3095,UNAUDITED PRO FORMA FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,3095.8,,3095.8.1,,"Unless the context otherwise requires, the definitions of terms provided in this “Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Statements” section apply solely for purposes of this section. On May 17, 2019, Catalent, Inc. (“Catalent” and, together with its subsidiaries, the “Company”), through its wholly owned subsidiary Catalent Holdco I Inc. (“Merger Sub”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Catalent Pharma Solutions, Inc. (in such capacity, “Buyer,” and otherwise referred to as “Operating Company”), completed its acquisition of Paragon Bioservices, Inc. (“Paragon”), pursuant to the merger of Merger Sub with and into Paragon (the “Merger”), with Paragon continuing as the surviving company in the Merger and as an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Buyer. The acquisition was completed in accordance with the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of April 14, 2019 (as amended, the “Merger Agreement”), by and among Buyer, Merger Sub, Paragon, Pearl Shareholder Representative, LLC, as representative of the Company Securityholders (as defined in the Merger Agreement), and, solely with respect to Sections 4.12 (solely with respect to the Equity Financing (as defined in the Merger Agreement)) and 8.19 of the Merger Agreement, Catalent. The purchase price was $1.2 billion in cash, subject to customary escrow arrangements and a purchase price adjustment related to, among other things, the amount of Paragon’s working capital (as adjusted, the “Closing Payment”). The Company financed the portion of the Closing Payment due at the closing of the Merger and related fees and expenses with the net proceeds of the Preferred Stock Issuance and the Incremental Dollar Term Loans (each as defined below). During May 2019, the Company designated 1,000,000 shares of its preferred stock, par value $0.01, as its “Series A Convertible Preferred Stock” (the “Series A Preferred Stock”), pursuant to a certificate of designation of preferences, rights, and limitations (as amended, the “Certificate of Designation”) filed with the Delaware Secretary of State, and issued and sold 650,000 shares of the Series A Preferred Stock (the “Preferred Stock Issuance”) for an aggregate purchase price of $650.0 million, to affiliates of Leonard Green & Partners, L.P. (the “Series A Investors”), each share having an initial stated value of $1,000 (as such value may be adjusted in accordance with the terms of the Certificate of Designation, the “Stated Value”). The Series A Preferred Stock ranks senior to the Company’s common stock, par value $0.01 (the “Common Stock”), with respect to dividend rights and rights upon the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the affairs of the Company. The holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to vote with the holders of shares of Common Stock as a single class on an “as-converted” basis and, for so long as the Series A Investors or their successors have the right to designate a nominee for election to the Company’s board of directors pursuant to the terms and conditions of the stockholders’ agreement, dated as of May 17, 2019, by and between the Company and the Series A Investors, have the right to elect one board member voting as a separate class. The holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock also have veto rights over (a) certain amendments to the Company’s organizational documents that would have an adverse effect on the rights, preferences, privileges, or voting powers of the Series A Preferred Stock; (b) the issuance of senior or pari passu securities; or (c) the incurrence of indebtedness above certain leverage ratios, as set forth in the Certificate of Designation. Holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock are also entitled (a) to receive a cumulative annual dividend equal to 5.0% of the Stated Value, payable quarterly in arrears in cash, by increasing the Stated Value, or in a combination thereof, at Catalent’s election, with such rate subject to an increase to 6.5% or 8.0% depending on the price of the Common Stock at the fourth (or in certain cases fifth) anniversary of the initial issuance, as set forth in the Certificate of Designation, and (b) to participate in the distribution of any ordinary dividend on the Common Stock calculated on an as-converted basis. The Series A Preferred Stock is subject to conversion or redemption under various circumstances, including the right of holders to convert some or all of their shares into shares of Common Stock after May 17, 2020 at a 27 ----- price initially equal to $49.5409 (the “Conversion Price”) and the Company’s right to (x) convert all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock at any time after May 17, 2022 if the average of the volume-weighted average price per share of Common Stock for thirty consecutive trading days exceeds 150% of the then-applicable Conversion Price or (y) redeem all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock at any time after May 17, 2024 at a price per share equal to the Stated Value, plus accrued and unpaid dividends, for cash, shares of Common Stock, or a combination thereof. The Conversion Price is subject to customary anti-dilution and other adjustments. In addition, holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock are eligible to demand redemption of their shares in the event of a change of control. In May 2019, Operating Company completed a fourth amendment (the “Fourth Amendment”) to its Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of May 20, 2014 (as amended through the Fourth Amendment, the “Credit Agreement”). As part of the Fourth Amendment, Operating Company borrowed $950.0 million aggregate principal amount of incremental term B loans (the “Incremental Dollar Term Loans”) and replaced the existing revolving credit commitments of $200.0 million with new revolving credit commitments of $550.0 million (the “Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments”). The Incremental Dollar Term Loans constitute a new class of U.S. dollar-denominated term loans under the Credit Agreement with the same principal terms as the then-existing U.S. dollar-denominated term loans (other than the maturity date) under the Credit Agreement (the “2024 USD Term Loans”). The proceeds of the Incremental Dollar Term Loans were used to pay the fees and expenses related to the Fourth Amendment, a voluntary prepayment of $300.0 million principal amount of previously outstanding 2024 USD Term Loans, and a portion of the Closing Payment. The Incremental Dollar Term Loans will mature at the earlier of (1) May 17, 2026 and (2) the 91[st] day prior to the maturity of Operating Company’s 4.75% senior unsecured notes due 2024 (the “Euro Notes”) or a permitted refinancing thereof, if on such 91[st] day any of the Euro Notes remains outstanding. There is a prepayment premium of 1.00% to any principal amount of the Incremental Dollar Term Loans that is subject to a repricing event during the first six-month period after the Fourth Amendment effective date. The Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments constitute revolving credit commitments under the Credit Agreement with the same principal terms as the previously existing revolving credit commitments under the Credit Agreement, except that the maturity date for revolving loans is now the earlier of (1) May 17, 2024 and (2) the 91[st] day prior to the maturity of any dollar term loans or euro term loans under the Credit Agreement, or any permitted refinancing thereof, if on such 91[st] day any of such dollar term loans or euro term loans remains outstanding. Under the Credit Agreement, the applicable rate for U.S. dollar-denominated term loans, including the Incremental Dollar Term Loans, is LIBOR (f/k/a the London Interbank Offered Rate, subject to a floor of 1.00%) plus 2.25%, and the applicable rate for euro-denominated term loans is Euribor (the Euro Interbank Offered Rate published by the European Money Markets Institute, subject to a floor of 1.00%) plus 1.75%. The applicable rate for the revolving loans is initially LIBOR plus 2.25%, and such rate can be reduced to LIBOR plus 2.00% in future periods based on a measure of Operating Company’s total leverage ratio. The outstanding euro-denominated term loans under the Credit Agreement will mature in May 2024. The Preferred Stock Issuance and the Fourth Amendment, including the application of the proceeds of the Incremental Dollar Term Loans as described above, are collectively referred to as the “Pro Forma Financing Transactions.” The Merger and the Pro Forma Financing Transactions are collectively referred to as the “Pro Forma Transactions.” In addition, Operating Company raised $500.0 million, before fees and expenses, through an offering of U.S. dollar-denominated senior unsecured notes due 2027 (the “USD 2027 Notes”), and the net proceeds were primarily used to repay in full the remaining outstanding borrowings under the 2024 USD Term Loans. In connection with the USD 2027 Notes offering and the Fourth Amendment, the Company incurred $27.0 million of debt discount and third-party financing costs, of which $5.4 million was expensed and recorded in other expense, net in this unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations. The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the year ended June 30, 2019 gives effect to the Pro Forma Transactions and the offering of the USD 2027 Notes as if all of them had occurred on July 1, 2018. For the avoidance of doubt, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of 28 ----- operations does not give effect to the MaSTherCell Acquisition, the Equity Offering, this offering of the notes or the Euro 2024 Notes Redemption. Because the Pro Forma Transactions and the offering of the USD 2027 Notes all occurred prior to the end of the Company’s 2019 fiscal year on June 30, 2019, the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2019 included in Catalent’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, filed August 27, 2019 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), includes a balance sheet as of June 30, 2019 that reflects the Pro Forma Transactions and the offering of the USD 2027 Notes. The Company’s fiscal year ends on June 30, while Paragon’s, prior to the Merger, ended on December 31. Pursuant to Rule 11-02(c)(3) of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the fiscal years have been conformed to have a fiscal year end of June 30 for the purpose of presenting this unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations, because the two fiscal year ends are separated by more than 93 days. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the year ended June 30, 2019 combines the amounts in the Company’s audited consolidated statement of operations for the year ended June 30, 2019 with the amounts in the unaudited statement of operations of Paragon for the period from July 1, 2018 to May 17, 2019. The unaudited statement of operations of Paragon for the period from July 1, 2018 to May 17, 2019 was derived by adding the amounts in the unaudited statement of operations of Paragon for the period from April 1, 2019 to May 17, 2019 to the amounts in the unaudited statement of operations for the nine months ended March 31, 2019. The unaudited statement of operations of Paragon for the nine months ended March 31, 2019 was derived by adding the amounts in the unaudited statement of operations of Paragon for the three months ended March 31, 2019 to the amounts in the audited statement of operations of Paragon for the year ended December 31, 2018 and subtracting the amounts in the unaudited statement of operations of Paragon for the six months ended June 30, 2018. The historical financial data described above is adjusted in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations to give effect to those unaudited pro forma adjustments that are (1) directly attributable to the Pro Forma Transactions or the offering of the USD 2027 Notes, (2) factually supportable, and (3) expected to have a continuing impact on the Company’s consolidated operating results. The unaudited pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and certain assumptions that the Company’s management believes are reasonable. Assumptions underlying the pro forma adjustments are described in the accompanying notes, which should be read in conjunction with the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations should be read in conjunction with the following information: - the notes to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations set forth herein; - the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements as of June 30, 2019 and for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 filed with the SEC as part of its Annual Report on Form 10-K on August 27, 2019, which is incorporated by reference herein; - the audited financial statements of Paragon as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018, which are included in the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K/A filed with the SEC on June 24, 2019, which is incorporated by reference herein; and - the unaudited financial statements of Paragon as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2019, which are included in the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K/A filed with the SEC on June 24, 2019, which is incorporated by reference herein. 29 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,156

322_2,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,59,DESCRIPTION OF OTHER INDEBTEDNESS,59.5,Brief Description of the Notes and the Guarantees,59.5.1,,"The notes: - will be general, unsecured, senior obligations of the Issuer; - will rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer (including, without limitation, the Senior Credit Facilities and the Existing Notes); - will be effectively subordinated to all existing and future secured Indebtedness of the Issuer (including, without limitation, the Senior Credit Facilities), to the extent of the collateral securing such Indebtedness; - will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future Indebtedness, claims of holders of any Preferred Stock that may be issued by, and other liabilities of, Subsidiaries of the Issuer that do not guarantee the notes; - will be senior in right of payment to any future Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer; and - will be initially guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Guarantors and will also be guaranteed in the future by each Subsidiary, if any, that guarantees Indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facilities. The Guarantee of each Guarantor in respect of the notes: - will be a general, unsecured, senior obligation of such Guarantor; - will rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future Senior Indebtedness of such Guarantor (including, without limitation, the Senior Credit Facilities and the Existing Notes); 39 ----- - will be effectively subordinated to all existing and future secured Indebtedness of such Guarantor (including, without limitation, the Senior Credit Facilities), to the extent of the collateral securing such Indebtedness; - will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future Indebtedness, claims of holders of any Preferred Stock that may be issued by, and other liabilities of, Subsidiaries of such Guarantor that do not guarantee the notes; and - will be senior in right of payment to any future Subordinated Indebtedness of such Guarantor. As of December 31, 2019, on an as adjusted basis after giving effect to the offering of the notes and the application of the net proceeds therefrom as described under “Use of Proceeds”, the Issuer and Guarantors had approximately $2,969.9 million (U.S. dollar equivalent) of total indebtedness outstanding, consisting of $1,268.9 million (U.S. dollar equivalent) of Secured Indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facilities, $1,428.4 million (U.S. dollar equivalent) of Senior Indebtedness, including $490.8 million (U.S. dollar equivalent) representing the notes, in each case inclusive of unamortized debt issuance costs, $95.9 million representing the accreted value of the remaining Deferred Purchase Consideration, and $176.7 million of capital lease and other obligations. In addition, the Issuer and Guarantors would have had an additional $543.3 million of unutilized capacity and $6.7 million of outstanding letters of credit under the revolving portion of the Senior Credit Facilities. The covenants in the Indenture applicable to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries do not apply to Parent or to any of Parent’s Subsidiaries other than the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries. In particular, the Indenture will not limit the amount of Indebtedness that Parent may incur. Although the Indenture will contain limitations on the amount of additional Indebtedness that the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may incur, such limitations are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions. Under certain circumstances, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may be able to incur additional Indebtedness and the amount of such Indebtedness could be substantial and, in any case, such Indebtedness may be Senior Indebtedness. Moreover, the Indenture does not impose any limitation on the incurrence by the Issuer or the Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness under the Indenture. See “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock”.",N/A,as_expected,2020,156
322_2,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,59,DESCRIPTION OF OTHER INDEBTEDNESS,59.6,Guarantees,59.6.1,,"Each existing and, in the future, subject to exceptions set forth under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries”, each subsequently acquired or organized Restricted Subsidiary that is a wholly owned Domestic Subsidiary and that guarantees the Senior Credit Facilities, will jointly and severally, irrevocably and unconditionally guarantee the performance and full and punctual payment when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all obligations of the Issuer under the Indenture and the notes on a senior basis, whether for payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest in respect of the notes, expenses, indemnification, or otherwise, on the terms set forth in the Indenture by executing the Indenture. As of the Issue Date, none of the Foreign Subsidiaries of the Issuer or non-wholly owned Domestic Subsidiaries that are Restricted Subsidiaries will guarantee the notes, and no such Subsidiaries are expected to guarantee the notes in the future. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization, or similar proceeding of any of these non-guarantor Subsidiaries, the non-guarantor Subsidiaries will pay the holders of their debt and trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to the Issuer or a Guarantor. As a result, all of the existing and future liabilities of such non-guarantor Subsidiaries, including any claims of trade creditors, will be effectively senior to the notes. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, such non-guarantor Subsidiaries represented 45.8% of total net revenues, and, as of December 31, 2019, such non-guarantor Subsidiaries represented 30.2% of total assets and 10.2% of total liabilities, in each case, after intercompany eliminations. 40 ----- The obligations of each Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance under applicable law. This provision may not, however, be effective to protect a Guarantee from being voided under fraudulent transfer law, or may reduce the applicable Guarantor’s obligation to an amount that effectively makes its Guarantee worthless. If a Guarantee was rendered voidable, it could be subordinated by a court to all other Indebtedness (including guarantees and other contingent liabilities) of the applicable Guarantor, and, depending on the amount of such Indebtedness, a Guarantor’s liability on its Guarantee could be reduced to zero. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes—U.S. Federal and state statutes allow courts, under specific circumstances, to cancel the notes or the related guarantees and require noteholders to return payments received from us or the guarantors”. Any Guarantor that makes a payment under its Guarantee will be entitled upon payment in full of all guaranteed obligations under the Indenture to a contribution from each other Guarantor in an amount equal to such other Guarantor’s pro rata portion of such payment based on the respective net assets of all the Guarantors at the time of such payment determined in accordance with GAAP. Each Guarantee by a Guarantor will provide by its terms that it will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon: (1) any sale, exchange, disposition, or transfer (by merger, consolidation, dividend, distribution, or otherwise) of (a) the Capital Stock of such Guarantor, after which the applicable Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary, or (b) all or substantially all the assets of such Guarantor, in each case, made in compliance with clauses (1) and (2) of the first paragraph under “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders— Asset Sales”; (2) the release or discharge of the guarantee by such Guarantor of Indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facilities or such other guarantee that resulted in the creation of such Guarantee, except a discharge or release by, or as a result of, payment under such guarantee; (3) the designation of any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in compliance with the provisions set forth under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments” and the definition of “Unrestricted Subsidiary”; (4) upon the merger or consolidation of any Guarantor with and into the Issuer or another Guarantor that is the surviving Person in such merger or consolidation, or upon the liquidation of such Guarantor following the transfer of all or substantially all of its assets to the Issuer or another Guarantor; or (5) the exercise by the Issuer of its legal defeasance option or covenant defeasance option as described under “—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” or the discharge of the Issuer’s obligations under the Indenture in accordance with the terms of the Indenture.",N/A,as_expected,2020,156

No notes of €100,000 or less will be redeemed in part. Notices of redemption shall be delivered electronically or mailed by first-class mail, postage prepaid, at least 10 but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of notes at such Holder’s registered address or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, except that redemption notices may be delivered more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a conditional redemption, defeasance of the notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture. For notes held on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, notices may be given by delivery of the relevant notices to Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, for communication to entitled account holders in substitution for the aforesaid delivery. If any note is to be redeemed in part only, any notice of redemption that relates to such note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof that has been or is to be redeemed. Subject to the terms and procedures set forth under “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form”, the Issuer will issue a new note in a principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the original note representing the same indebtedness to the extent not redeemed in the name of the Holder upon cancellation of the original note.

322_2,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,59,DESCRIPTION OF OTHER INDEBTEDNESS,59.17,Repurchase at the Option of Holders,59.17.1,Change of Control,"The notes will provide that, if a Change of Control occurs, unless the Issuer has previously sent a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding notes as described under “—Optional Redemption” or “—Taxation Redemption”, the Issuer will make an offer to purchase all of the notes pursuant to the offer described below (a “Change of Control Offer”) at a price in cash (the “Change of Control Payment”) equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of purchase, subject to the right of Holders of the notes of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date. Within 30 days following any Change of Control, except to the extent that the Issuer has exercised its right to redeem all the outstanding notes as described under “—Optional Redemption” or “—Taxation Redemption”, the Issuer will send notice of such Change of Control Offer electronically or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee and paying agent, to each Holder of notes at the address of such holder appearing in the register of Holders or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, with the following information: (1) that a Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to the covenant entitled “Change of Control”, and that all notes properly tendered pursuant to such Change of Control Offer will be accepted for payment by the Issuer; (2) the purchase price and the purchase date, which will be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is sent (the “Change of Control Payment Date”), except in the case of a conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control as described below; (3) that any note not properly tendered will remain outstanding and continue to accrue interest; (4) that, unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the Change of Control Payment, all notes accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest on the Change of Control Payment Date; (5) that Holders electing to have any notes purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will be required to surrender such notes, with the form entitled “Option of Holder to Elect Purchase” on the reverse of such notes completed, to the paying agent specified in the notice at the address specified in the notice prior to the close of business on the third Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date; (6) that Holders will be entitled to withdraw their tendered notes and their election to require the Issuer to purchase such notes; provided that the paying agent receives, not later than the close of business on the fourth Business Day prior to the Change of Control Payment Date, an electronic transmission, facsimile transmission, or letter setting forth the name of the Holder of the notes, the principal amount of notes tendered for purchase, and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing its tendered notes and its election to have such notes purchased; (7) that Holders (other than Holders of a global note) whose notes are being purchased only in part will be issued new notes and such new notes will be equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the notes surrendered. The unpurchased portion of the notes must be equal to at least €100,000 or an integral multiple of €1,000 in excess thereof; (8) if such notice is sent prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, a statement that the Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control and, if applicable, a statement that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the Change of Control Payment Date may be delayed until such time as the 47 ----- Change of Control shall have occurred, or that such purchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event the Change of Control shall not have occurred by the Change of Control Payment Date, or by the Change of Control Payment Date as so delayed; and (9) the other instructions, as determined by the Issuer, consistent with the covenant described hereunder, that a Holder must follow. The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall be deemed not to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuer will, to the extent permitted by law, (1) accept for payment all notes issued by it or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer, (2) have deposited with the paying agent an amount equal to the aggregate Change of Control Payment in respect of all notes or portions thereof so tendered, and (3) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee for cancellation the notes so accepted together with an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee stating that such notes or portions thereof have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuer. The Senior Credit Facilities prohibit or limit, and future credit agreements or other agreements to which the Issuer becomes a party may prohibit or limit, the Issuer from purchasing any notes as a result of a Change of Control. In the event a Change of Control occurs at a time when the Issuer is prohibited from purchasing the notes, the Issuer could seek the consent of its lenders to permit the purchase of the notes or could attempt to refinance the Indebtedness that contain such prohibition. If the Issuer does not obtain such consent or repay such Indebtedness, the Issuer will remain prohibited from purchasing the notes. In such case, the Issuer’s failure to purchase tendered notes would constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture. The Senior Credit Facilities provide, and future credit agreements or other agreements to which the Issuer becomes a party may provide, that certain change of control events with respect to the Issuer would constitute a default thereunder (including a Change of Control under the Indenture). If the Issuer experiences a change of control that triggers a default under the Senior Credit Facilities, the Issuer could seek a waiver of such default or seek to refinance the Senior Credit Facilities. In the event the Issuer does not obtain such a waiver or refinance the Senior Credit Facilities, such default could result in amounts outstanding under the Senior Credit Facilities being declared due and payable and/or cause a Qualified Securitization Facility to be wound down. The Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders of notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by the Issuer’s then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Change of Control purchase feature of the notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of the Issuer and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the Issuer and the initial purchasers of the notes. The Issuer has no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control, although it is possible that the Issuer could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Issuer could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings, or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect the Issuer’s capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on the 48 ----- Issuer’s ability to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” and “—Certain Covenants—Liens”. Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenant or provision that may afford Holders of the notes protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times, and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) in connection with or in contemplation of any such Change of Control, the Issuer (or any Affiliate of the Issuer) has made an offer to purchase (an “Alternate Offer”) any and all notes validly tendered at a cash price equal to or higher than the Change of Control Payment and has purchased all notes properly tendered in accordance with the terms of the Alternate Offer. Additionally, the Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer if the Issuer has previously issued a notice of redemption for all of the notes pursuant to the provisions set forth under “—Optional Redemption” or “—Taxation Redemption”. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of making of the Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer, and the Change of Control Payment Date may be extended automatically until such Change of Control occurs. A Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer may be made at the same time as consents are solicited with respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture, notes, and/or Guarantees (but the Change of Control Offer may not condition tenders on the delivery of such consents). The definition of “Change of Control” includes a sale, lease, or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any Person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all”, there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a sale, lease, or transfer of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder of notes may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the notes as described above. The provisions under the Indenture relative to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding.",N/A,as_expected,2020,156

Within 450 days after the receipt of the Net Cash Proceeds of any Asset Sale, the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, at its option, may apply the Net Cash Proceeds from such Asset Sale, (1) to reduce (a) Obligations under Secured Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor (and, if such Indebtedness is revolving credit Indebtedness, to correspondingly and permanently reduce commitments with respect thereto); (b) Obligations under other Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor that ranks equally in right of payment with the notes or the relevant Guarantee (and, if such Indebtedness is revolving credit Indebtedness, to correspondingly and permanently reduce commitments with respect thereto); provided that if the Issuer or any Guarantor shall so reduce Obligations under such other Indebtedness, the Issuer shall equally and ratably reduce Obligations under the notes by (i) redeeming the notes as provided under “—Optional Redemption”, (ii) purchasing the notes through open-market purchases (to the extent such purchases are at or above 100% of the principal amount thereof) or (iii) making an offer (in accordance with the procedures set forth below for an Asset Sale Offer) to all Holders of notes to purchase their notes at 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued but unpaid interest, if any, on the amount of notes that would otherwise be prepaid; or (c) Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor; (2) to make (a) an Investment in any one or more businesses, provided that such Investment in any business is in the form of the acquisition of Capital Stock and results in the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be, owning an amount of the Capital Stock of such business such that it constitutes or continues to constitute a Restricted Subsidiary, (b) an Investment in properties, (c) capital expenditures, or (d) acquisitions of other assets, in each of (a), (b), (c), and (d), used or useful in a Similar Business or that replace the businesses, properties, and/or assets that are the subject of such Asset Sale; or (3) any combination of the foregoing; 50 ----- _provided that, in the case of clause (2) above, a binding commitment entered into within 450 days after the Asset_ Sale shall be treated as a permitted application of the Net Cash Proceeds from the date of such commitment so long as the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary enters into such commitment with the good-faith expectation that such Net Cash Proceeds will be applied to satisfy such commitment within 180 days of such commitment (an “Acceptable Commitment”) and, in the event any Acceptable Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before the Net Cash Proceeds are applied in connection therewith, the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary enters into another Acceptable Commitment (a “Second Commitment”) within 180 days of such cancellation or termination; provided further that, if any Second Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before such Net Cash Proceeds are applied, then such Net Cash Proceeds shall constitute Excess Proceeds. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that (i) any of or all the Net Cash Proceeds of any Asset Sales by a Foreign Subsidiary (a “Foreign Disposition”) is prohibited or delayed by applicable local law from being repatriated to the United States or (ii) the Issuer, in its sole discretion, has determined in good faith that repatriation of any of or all of the Net Cash Proceeds of any Foreign Disposition would result in material adverse tax consequences, the portion of such Net Cash Proceeds so affected will not be required to be applied in compliance with this covenant; provided that, within 450 days of the receipt of the Net Cash Proceeds of any Foreign Disposition, the Issuer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to permit repatriation of such proceeds that would otherwise be subject to this covenant without violating applicable local law or incurring material adverse tax consequences, and, if such proceeds may be repatriated, within such 450 day period, such proceeds shall be applied in compliance with this covenant. Any Net Cash Proceeds from any Asset Sale that are not invested or applied as provided and within the time period set forth in the two preceding paragraphs (it being understood that any portion of such net proceeds used to make an offer to purchase notes, as described in clause (1) above shall be deemed to have been invested whether or not such offer is accepted) will be deemed to constitute “Excess Proceeds”. When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds $85.0 million, the Issuer shall make an offer (an “Asset Sale Offer”) to all Holders of the notes and, if required by the terms of any Indebtedness that is pari passu with the notes (“Pari _Passu Indebtedness”), to the holders of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum aggregate_ principal amount of the notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, that, in the case of the notes, is in an amount at least equal to €100,000, or an integral multiple of €1,000 thereafter, that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds at an offer price in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof (or in the event such other Indebtedness was issued with original issue discount, 100% of the accreted value thereof), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date fixed for the closing of such offer, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture and the agreements governing any such Pari Passu Indebtedness. The Issuer will commence an Asset Sale Offer as described in this paragraph with respect to Excess Proceeds within 10 Business Days after the date that Excess Proceeds exceed $85.0 million by delivering the notice required pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, with a copy to the Trustee and paying agent. The Issuer may satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to any Net Cash Proceeds from an Asset Sale by making an Asset Sale Offer with respect to such Net Cash Proceeds prior to the expiration of the relevant 450 days (or such longer period provided above) or with respect to Excess Proceeds of $85.0 million or less. To the extent that the aggregate amount of notes and, if applicable, Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Issuer may use any remaining Excess Proceeds (“Declined Proceeds”) for any purpose not otherwise prohibited under the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of notes and, if applicable, Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by such holders thereof exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Issuer shall select the notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis based on the accreted value or principal amount of the notes or such Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered with adjustments as necessary so that no notes or Pari Passu Indebtedness will be purchased in part in an unauthorized denomination. Upon completion of any such Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds that resulted in the Asset Sale Offer shall be reset to zero (regardless of whether there are any remaining Excess Proceeds upon such completion). Upon consummation or expiration of any Asset Sale Offer, any remaining Net 51 ----- Cash Proceeds shall not be deemed Excess Proceeds and the Issuer may use such Net Cash Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited under the Indenture. An Asset Sale Offer may be made at the same time as consents are solicited with respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture, notes or Guarantees (but the Asset Sale Offer may not condition tenders on the delivery of such consents). Pending the final application of any Net Cash Proceeds pursuant to this covenant, the holder of such Net Cash Proceeds may apply such Net Cash Proceeds temporarily to reduce Indebtedness outstanding under a revolving credit facility or otherwise invest such Net Cash Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture. The procedures for an Asset Sale Offer will be substantially the same as the Change of Control Offer. The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall be deemed not to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. The Senior Credit Facilities prohibit or limit, and future credit agreements or other agreements to which the Issuer becomes a party may prohibit or limit, the Issuer from purchasing any notes pursuant to this Asset Sales covenant. In the event the Issuer is prohibited from purchasing the notes, the Issuer could seek the consent of its lenders to permit the purchase of the notes or could attempt to refinance the Indebtedness that contains such prohibition. If the Issuer does not obtain such consent or repay such Indebtedness, the Issuer will remain prohibited from purchasing the notes. In such case, the Issuer’s failure to purchase tendered notes would constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture. The provisions under the Indenture relative to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the notes as a result of an Asset Sale may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding.",N/A,as_expected,2020,156

The Indenture will not treat (1) unsecured Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to Secured Indebtedness merely because it is unsecured or (2) Senior Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to any other Senior Indebtedness merely because it has a junior priority with respect to the same collateral.",N/A,as_expected,2020,156

The Indenture will provide that the Trustee may withhold from the Holders notice of any continuing Default or Event of Default, except a Default or Event of Default relating to the payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest, if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest. In addition, the Trustee will have no obligation to accelerate the notes if in the best judgment of the Trustee acceleration is not in the interests of the Holders of the notes.

A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code. In addition, the fiduciary of the ERISA Plan that engaged in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes, penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code. The acquisition and/or holding of notes by an ERISA Plan with respect to which the Issuer, an initial purchaser, or any of their respective affiliates is considered a party in interest or a disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code, unless the investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. 116 ----- In this regard, the U.S. Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions, or “PTCEs,” that may provide exemptive relief for direct or indirect prohibited transactions resulting from the sale, purchase, or holding of the notes. These class exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 75-1 respecting specified transactions involving employee benefit plans and broker-dealers, reporting dealers and banks, PTCE 84-14 respecting transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1 respecting insurance company pooled separate accounts, PTCE 91-38 respecting bank collective investment funds, PTCE 95-60 respecting life insurance company general accounts and PTCE 96-23 respecting transactions determined by in-house asset managers. In addition, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Internal Revenue Code provide relief from the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code for certain transactions, provided that neither the Issuer nor any of its affiliates (directly or indirectly) has or exercises any discretionary authority or control or render any investment advice with respect to the assets of any ERISA Plan involved in the transaction, and provided further that the ERISA Plan receives no less and pays no more than adequate consideration in connection with the transaction. Each of these statutory exemptions and PTCEs contain conditions and limitations on their application and do not provide relief from the self-dealing prohibitions under ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code. It should also be noted that even if the conditions specified in one or more of these exemptions are met, the scope of relief provided by these exemptions may not necessarily cover all acts that might be construed as prohibited transactions. Accordingly, the fiduciary of a Plan that is considering acquiring and/or holding the notes in reliance on any of these, or any other exemptions, should carefully review the exemption with its counsel to confirm that it is applicable. There can be no, and we do not provide any, assurance that any of these exemptions or any other exemption will be available with respect to the acquisition of the notes, and there can be no assurance that all of the conditions of any such exemptions will be satisfied. Because of the foregoing, the notes should not be acquired or held by any person investing “plan assets” of any Plan, unless such purchase and holding will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction under ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code or a similar violation of any applicable Similar Laws.",N/A,as_expected,2020,156

The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all-inclusive, nor should it be construed as legal advice. Due to the complexity of these rules and the excise taxes, penalties and liabilities that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries or other persons considering purchasing or holding the notes on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their counsel regarding the potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code and any Similar Laws to such investment and whether an exemption would be applicable to the purchase and holding of the notes. Each purchaser or subsequent transferee has exclusive responsibility for ensuring that its purchase and holding of a note does not violate the fiduciary or prohibited transaction rules of ERISA or the Internal Revenue Code or the provisions of applicable Similar Laws.

Payments of stated interest on the notes will be denominated in euro and, accordingly, the following rules will apply. A cash basis U.S. Holder will be required to include in income the U.S. dollar value of the euro amount of interest received (including amounts received upon the disposition of a note attributable to accrued but unpaid interest), determined by translating such amount into U.S. dollars at the spot exchange rate in effect on the date of receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars on such date. A cash basis U.S. Holder generally will not recognize any foreign currency gain or loss on receipt of a euro interest payment but may recognize foreign currency gain or loss attributable to the actual disposition of the euro received. An accrual basis U.S. Holder will be required to accrue interest income on a note in euro and translate the amount accrued into U.S. dollars based on the average exchange rate in effect during the interest accrual period (or portion thereof within the U.S. Holder’s taxable year). As an alternative, an accrual basis U.S. Holder may elect to accrue interest income at the spot exchange rate in effect on the last day of the accrual period (or last day of the taxable year within such accrual period if the accrual period spans more than one taxable year) or at the spot exchange rate in effect on the date the interest payment is received if such date is within five business days 119 ----- of the last day of the accrual period. An accrual basis U.S. Holder that makes such an election under the alternative method must apply it consistently to all debt instruments held by such U.S. Holder from year to year and cannot change the election without the consent of the IRS and, accordingly, U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors as to the desirability, mechanics, and collateral consequences of making this election. Upon receipt of a euro interest payment (including amounts received upon the disposition of a note attributable to accrued but unpaid interest), an accrual basis U.S. Holder generally will recognize foreign currency gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between (i) the U.S. dollar value of such payment determined by translating the payment at the spot exchange rate for euro in effect on the date such payment of interest is received (or the note is disposed of) and (ii) the U.S. dollar value of the interest income that such U.S. Holder has previously accrued with respect to such payment of interest (or accrued interest), regardless of whether the payment is actually converted into U.S. dollars on the date of receipt.

If a U.S. Holder receives euros on the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a note, the amount realized generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the euros received, calculated at the spot exchange rate in effect on the date of the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition. However, if the notes are traded on an established securities market, a cash basis U.S. Holder (or, upon election, an accrual basis U.S. Holder) will determine the U.S. dollar amount realized by translating the euros received at the spot exchange rate in effect on the settlement date of the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition. If an accrual basis U.S. Holder makes such an election, the election must be applied consistently to all debt instruments held by such U.S. Holder from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. If an accrual basis U.S. Holder does not make such an election, such a holder will determine the U.S. dollar value of the amount realized by translating that amount at the spot exchange rate in effect on the date of the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition and generally will recognize foreign currency gain or loss equal to the difference (if any) between (i) the U.S. dollar value of the euro amount realized based on the spot exchange rate in effect on the date of the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition and (ii) the U.S. dollar value of the euro amount realized based on the spot exchange rate in effect on the settlement date. A U.S. Holder’s tax basis in a note generally will be its U.S. dollar cost for the note. If a U.S. Holder pays the purchase price for a note in euros, such U.S. Holder’s tax basis in the note generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the euro purchase price on the date of purchase, calculated at the spot exchange rate in effect on such date. However, if the notes are traded on an established securities market, a cash basis U.S. Holder (or, upon election, an accrual basis U.S. Holder) will determine the U.S. dollar value of the euro purchase price by translating the euros paid at the spot exchange rate in effect on the settlement date of the purchase. As described above, if an accrual basis U.S. Holder makes such an election, the election must be applied consistently to all debt instruments held by such U.S. Holder from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. If an accrual basis U.S. Holder does not make such an election, such a holder will determine the U.S. dollar value of the euro purchase price by translating the euro amount paid at the spot exchange rate in effect on the date of the purchase and generally will recognize foreign currency gain or loss equal to the difference (if any) 120 ----- between (i) the U.S. dollar value of the euro purchase price based on the spot exchange rate in effect on the date of purchase and (ii) the U.S. dollar value of the euro purchase price based on the spot exchange rate in effect on the settlement date. Subject to the discussion of foreign currency gain or loss below, any gain or loss on a sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of the notes generally will be capital gain or loss. This capital gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if, at the time of the sale, exchange redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition, you have held the notes for more than one year. Subject to limited exceptions, your capital losses cannot be used to offset your ordinary income. If you are a non-corporate U.S. Holder, under current law your long-term capital gain generally will be subject to a preferential rate of U.S. federal income tax. A U.S. Holder may recognize foreign currency gain or loss attributable to a change in exchange rates between the date of the purchase of a note and the date of the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of the note. Gain or loss attributable to a change in exchange rates will equal the difference between (i) the U.S. dollar value of the euro principal amount of the note determined based on the spot exchange rate in effect on the date that the note is disposed of and (ii) the U.S. dollar value of the euro principal amount of the note determined based on the spot exchange rate in effect on the date the U.S. Holder acquired the note. For this purpose, the principal amount of the note is the U.S. Holder’s purchase price for the note in euros. The realization of such foreign currency gain or loss will be limited to the amount of overall gain or loss realized on the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of the note.

A U.S. Holder’s tax basis in euros received as interest on a note will be the U.S. dollar value thereof determined at the spot exchange rate in effect on the date the holder received the euros.

In addition, this summary does not address special U.S. federal income tax rules that may be applicable to certain categories of beneficial owners of notes, such as: - dealers in securities or currencies; - traders in securities; - U.S. Holders (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar; - persons holding notes as part of a conversion, constructive sale, wash sale or other integrated transaction or a hedge, straddle, synthetic security, or other risk reduction strategy; - persons subject to the alternative minimum tax; - U.S. expatriates and former citizens or long-term residents of the United States; - banks and other financial institutions; - insurance companies; - controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment companies, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, and corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax, and shareholders of such corporations; - real estate investment trusts; - entities that are tax-exempt for U.S. federal income tax purposes and retirement plans, individual retirement accounts, tax-deferred accounts, and governmental organizations; and - pass-through entities, including S corporations, partnerships, and other entities and arrangements classified as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and beneficial owners of pass-through entities. In the case of an entity or arrangement classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes that holds notes, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in the partnership generally will depend on the status of the partner, the activities of the partnership and certain determinations made at the partner level. If you are a partnership considering purchasing notes, or a partner in such a partnership, you should consult your own tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of purchasing, owning, and disposing of the notes. This summary is based on U.S. federal income tax law, including the Internal Revenue Code, Treasury regulations, administrative rulings and judicial authorities, all as in effect or in existence as of the date of this offering memorandum. Subsequent developments in U.S. federal income tax law, including changes in law or differing interpretations, which may be applied retroactively, could have a material effect on the U.S. federal income tax consequences of purchasing, owning, and disposing of the notes set forth in this summary. We cannot assure you that the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) will not challenge one or more of the tax consequences described in this summary, and we have not obtained, nor do we intend to obtain, any ruling from the IRS or opinion of counsel with respect to the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership, or disposition of the notes. In 118 ----- addition, this summary does not discuss any U.S. federal tax consequences other than U.S. federal income tax consequences, such as estate or gift tax consequences or the Medicare tax on net investment income, or any U.S. state or local income or non-U.S. income or other tax consequences. Before you purchase notes, you should consult your own tax advisor regarding the particular U.S. federal, state and local and non-U.S. income and other tax consequences of acquiring, owning, and disposing of the notes that may be applicable to you.",N/A,as_expected,2020,156

The purchase agreement provides that the obligation of the initial purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of the notes is subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by their counsel. The initial purchasers may offer and sell the notes through certain of their affiliates. The purchase agreement provides that we, on one hand, and the initial purchasers, on the other hand, will indemnify each other against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act and will contribute to payments the other may be required to make in respect thereof. To facilitate the offering of the notes, the initial purchasers may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the notes. Specifically, the initial purchasers may over-allot in connection with this offering of the notes, creating a short position in the notes for their own account. In addition, to cover overallotments or to stabilize the price of the notes, the initial purchasers may bid for, and purchase, the notes in the open market. Finally, the initial purchasers may reclaim selling concessions allowed to an agent or a dealer for distributing the notes in the offering, if the initial purchasers repurchase previously distributed notes in transactions to cover short positions, in stabilization transactions or otherwise. Any of these activities may stabilize or maintain the market price of the notes above independent market levels. The initial purchasers are not required to engage in these activities and may end any of these activities at any time. The notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws. The initial purchasers propose to offer the notes for resale in transactions not requiring registration under the Securities Act or applicable state securities laws, including sales pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S. The initial purchasers will not offer or sell the notes except to persons they reasonably believe to be qualified institutional buyers or pursuant to offers and sales to non-U.S. persons that occur outside of the United States within the meaning of Regulation S. In addition, until 40 days following the commencement of this offering, an offer or sale of notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the offering) may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act unless the dealer makes the offer or sale in compliance with Rule 144A or another exemption from registration under the Securities Act. Each purchaser of the notes will be deemed to have made acknowledgments, representations, and agreements as described under “Notice to Investors.” 128 ----- In connection with sales outside the United States, the initial purchasers have agreed that they will not offer, sell, or deliver the notes to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons (1) as part of their distribution at any time or (2) otherwise prior to 40 days after the closing of the offering, and they will send to any dealer to whom it sells notes during such period a confirmation or other notice setting forth the restrictions on offers and sales of the notes within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons. We cannot assure you that the initial prices at which the notes will sell in the market after this offering of the notes will not be lower than the initial offering price or that an active trading market for the notes will develop after completion of this offering of the notes. The notes are a new issue of securities with no established trading market. The initial purchasers have advised us that they currently intend to make a market in the notes. However, they are not obligated to do so and may discontinue any market-making activities with respect to the notes at any time without notice. In addition, market-making activities will be subject to the limits imposed by the Exchange Act and may be limited. Accordingly, we cannot assure you as to the liquidity of, or trading market for, the notes. Application will be made to the Authority for the listing of and permission to deal in the notes on the Exchange. There can be no assurance that the notes will be listed on the Exchange, that such permission to deal in the notes will be granted, or that such listing will be maintained, and settlement of the notes is not conditioned on obtaining such listing. We expect that delivery of the notes will be made against payment therefor on or about, 2020, which will be the business day following the date of pricing of the notes (such settlement cycle being herein referred to as “T+ ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade notes prior to the date that is two business days prior to the delivery of the notes will be required, by virtue of the fact that the notes initially will settle T+, to specify an alternate settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of notes who wish to trade notes prior to the date that is two business days prior to the delivery of the notes should consult their own advisors. We have agreed that we will not, without the prior written consent of J.P. Morgan Securities plc, for a period of 30 days from the date of this offering memorandum, offer, sell, contract to sell, or otherwise dispose of, among other restrictions, any debt securities having a maturity of more than one year from the date of issue or securities exchangeable for or convertible into debt securities of ours substantially similar to the notes.",N/A,as_expected,2020,156

If the initial purchasers or their affiliates have a lending relationship with us, certain of the initial purchasers or their affiliates routinely hedge, and certain other of the initial purchasers or their affiliates may hedge, their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, the initial purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the notes offered hereby. Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the notes offered hereby. The initial purchasers and their respective affiliates may all make investment recommendations or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or instruments and may at any time hold, or recommend clients that they acquire, long or short positions in such securities and instruments. 132 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,156
