the target market assessment in respect of the notes and related guarantees (together, the “Notes”) offered
by the offering memorandum following this notice has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for
the Notes is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in Directive 2014/65/EU
(as amended, “MiFID II”); and (ii) all channels for the distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties
and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the
Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment;
however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment
in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and
determining appropriate distribution channels.

**UK MIFIR PRODUCT GOVERNANCE/PROFESSIONAL INVESTORS AND ECPS**
**ONLY TARGET MARKET—Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process,**

Sourcebook, and professional clients as defined in Regulation (EU) No. 600/2014 as it forms part of
domestic law in the UK by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as amended, the
“EUWA”) (“UK MiFIR”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and

assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.


**PRIIPS REGULATION—PROHIBITION OF SALES TO EEA RETAIL INVESTORS—**
The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered,
sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor
means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of MiFID II; (ii) a
customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a
professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as
defined in Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (the “Prospectus Regulation”). Consequently, no key information
document required by Regulation (EU) No. 1286/2014, as amended (the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for
offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been
prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail
investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

**PRELIMINARY OFFERING MEMORANDUM** **CONFIDENTIAL**

# Coty Inc.


## €500,000,000       % SENIOR SECURED NOTES DUE 2028

Coty Inc. (the “Company”), HFC Prestige Products, Inc., a Connecticut corporation and an
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“HFC Inc.”), and HFC Prestige International U.S.
LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company
(“HFC Prestige,” together with HFC Inc., the “Co-Issuers,” and the Co-Issuers together with the
Company, the “Issuers”), are offering €500.0 million principal amount of        % Senior Secured
Notes due 2028 (the “Notes”). The Notes will bear interest at a rate of       % per year, payable on
and      of each year, beginning      , 2024. The Notes will mature on     , 2028.


We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering to repay a portion of the borrowings
outstanding under our revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”), without a reduction in
commitment. We will use cash on hand to pay the offering expenses payable by us in connection with this
offering. See “Use of Proceeds.”

At any time prior to      , 2025, the Issuers may redeem some or all of the Notes at a price
equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if
any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, plus a “make-whole” premium, as described in this offering
memorandum. On or after      , 2025, the Issuers may redeem some or all of the Notes at the
applicable redemption prices set forth in this offering memorandum, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if
any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. At any time on or prior to      , 2025, the Issuers may
redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes using the net cash proceeds from certain
equity offerings at the applicable redemption price set forth in this offering memorandum, plus accrued
and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. See “Description of Notes—Optional
Redemption.” We may also redeem the Notes in whole but not in part, at any time, upon the occurrence of
certain tax events. See “Description of Notes—Redemption for Tax Reasons.”


If we experience a change of control triggering event with respect to the Notes as described in
this offering memorandum under the heading “Description of Notes—Repurchase of Notes upon a
Change of Control Triggering Event,” the Issuers will be required to offer to repurchase any and all of the
Notes from the holders.

The Notes will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior secured
basis (the “guarantees”) by the Company’s existing and future wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries, other than
the Co-Issuers (the “Guarantors”), that guarantee our obligations under our existing senior secured term
loan facilities and our Revolving Credit Facility (collectively, the “Existing Credit Facilities”) and certain
other material indebtedness. The Notes and the guarantees will be the Issuers’ and the Guarantors’ senior
obligations and will be secured, subject to permitted liens and certain other exceptions, by first-priority
liens on the same Collateral (as defined herein) that secures the obligations under the Existing Credit


-----

Facilities, the 5.000% senior secured notes due 2026 (the “5.000% Senior Secured Notes”), the 3.875%
senior secured notes due 2026 (the “3.875% Senior Secured Notes”), the 4.750% senior secured notes due
2029 (the “4.750% Senior Secured Notes”) and the 6.625% senior secured notes due 2030 (the “6.625%
Senior Secured Notes” and, together with the 5.000% Senior Secured Notes, the 3.875% Senior Secured
Notes and the 4.750% Senior Secured Notes, the “Existing Secured Notes”). See “Description of Notes—
Security.” The guarantees, obligations of the Co-Issuers under the Notes and liens on the Collateral will
be subject to release under certain circumstances. See “Description of Notes—Guarantees,” “Description
of Notes—Security,” “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants—Consolidation, Merger and
Conveyance, Transfer and Lease of Assets” and “Description of Notes—Covenant Suspension When
Notes Obtain Investment Grade Rating.”

The Notes and the guarantees will be equal in right of payment with the Issuers’ and the
Guarantors’ respective existing and future senior indebtedness and will be senior to all of the Issuers’ and
the Guarantors’ existing and future indebtedness that is, by its terms, expressly subordinated in right of
payment to the Notes or the guarantees, as the case may be. The Notes and the guarantees will be
effectively pari passu with the Issuers’ and the Guarantors’ respective existing and future indebtedness
that is secured by a first-priority lien on the Collateral (including the obligations under the Existing Credit
Facilities and the Existing Secured Notes) to the extent of the value of the Collateral, and effectively
senior to the Issuers’ and the Guarantors’ respective existing and future indebtedness that is unsecured,
including our existing unsecured senior notes (the “Existing Unsecured Notes” and, together with the
Existing Secured Notes, the “Existing Notes”) and the guarantees thereof, or that is secured by junior
liens on the Collateral, to the extent of the value of the Collateral. In addition, the Notes and the
guarantees will be structurally subordinated to all liabilities of any of the Company’s subsidiaries (other
than the Co-Issuers) that do not guarantee the Notes and will be effectively junior to any indebtedness of
the Issuers or the Guarantors that is secured by assets that are not Collateral, to the extent of the value of
such assets.

**See “Risk Factors” beginning on page 19 and in our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K,**
**which is incorporated by reference herein (as such risk factors may be updated from time to time in**
**our public filings) for a discussion of certain risks that you should consider in connection with an**
**investment in the Notes.**

**Notes issue price:     % plus accrued interest, if any, from      , 2023**

**The Notes and related guarantees have not been registered, and the Issuers will not be**
**required to register the Notes and related guarantees, under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended**
**(the “Securities Act”), or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction and may not be offered or sold**
**within the United States to, or for the benefit of, U.S. persons (as defined in Regulation S under the**
**Securities Act (“Regulation S”)) except in a transaction exempt from, or not subject to, the**
**registration requirements of the Securities Act. The Issuers and the initial purchasers named below**
**are offering the Notes only to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers**
**(“QIBs”) under Rule 144A under the Securities Act (“Rule 144A”) and to non-U.S. persons outside**
**the United States in reliance on Regulation S and, if investors are residents of a member state of the**
**European Economic Area (the “EEA”) or the United Kingdom (the “UK”), not to retail investors.**
**Prospective purchasers that are QIBs are hereby notified that the seller of the Notes may be relying**
**on the exemption from the registration requirements under the Securities Act provided by Rule**


-----

**144A. For a description of certain information about eligible offerees and restrictions on transfers**
**of the Notes, see “Notice to Investors,” “Plan of Distribution” and “Transfer Restrictions.”**

Application will be made to The International Stock Exchange Authority (the “Authority” or
“TISEA”) for the listing of and permission to deal in the Notes on the Official List of The International
Stock Exchange (“TISE”). No application has been made for the Notes to be listed on any other stock
exchange. TISE is not a regulated market for the purposes of Directive 2014/65/EU or Markets in
Financial Instruments Directive, as amended (“MiFID II”). This offering memorandum constitutes a
“Listing Document” for the purposes of the Listing Rules maintained by the Authority.

We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made to investors in book-entry form through the
facilities of Clearstream Banking, S.A. (“Clearstream”) and Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V. (“Euroclear”) on
or about     , 2023.

memorandum is personal to the offeree to whom it has been delivered by the initial purchasers and does

unauthorized and any disclosure of the contents of this offering memorandum without our prior written
consent is prohibited. By accepting delivery of this offering memorandum, you agree to the foregoing and

investigation of the accuracy of such information or your investment decision and (3) the Issuers have not

contents. The information contained in and incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum has
been furnished by us and other sources we believe to be reliable. The initial purchasers make no
representations or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any of the

documents. All such summaries are qualified in their entirety by this reference. See “Where You Can

Neither the initial purchasers nor any of their respective affiliates have authorized the whole or
any part of this offering memorandum and none of them makes any representation or warranty or accepts
any responsibility as to the accuracy or completeness of the information contained in this offering
memorandum or any responsibility for any act or omission of the Issuers, the Guarantors or any other
person (other than the relevant initial purchaser) in connection with the issue and offering of the Notes.
Neither the delivery of this offering memorandum nor the offering, sale or delivery of any Note shall in
any circumstances create any implication that there has been no adverse change, or any event reasonably
likely to involve any adverse change, in the condition (financial or otherwise) of the Issuers since the date
of this offering memorandum.

This offering memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy
the Notes to any person in any jurisdiction where it is unlawful to make such offer or solicitation. You are
not to construe the contents of this offering memorandum as investment, legal or tax advice. You should
consult your own counsel, accountant and other advisors as to legal, tax, business, financial and related
aspects of a purchase of the Notes. The Issuers are not, and the initial purchasers are not, making any
representation to you regarding the legality of an investment in the Notes by you under applicable legal
investment or similar laws.

**None of the Notes or the related guarantees have been registered with, recommended by or**
**approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) or any other federal or**
**state securities commission or regulatory authority, nor has the SEC or any state securities**
**commission or regulatory authority passed upon the accuracy or adequacy of this offering**
**memorandum. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.**

The offering is being made in reliance upon an exemption from registration under the Securities
Act for an offer and sale of securities that does not involve a public offering. In making your purchase,
you will be deemed to have made certain acknowledgments, representations and agreements set forth in
this offering memorandum under the caption “Transfer Restrictions.” The Notes are subject to restrictions
on transferability and resale and may not be transferred or resold except as permitted under the Securities
Act and applicable state securities laws pursuant to registration or an exemption from registration. You
should be aware that you may be required to bear the financial risks of this investment for an indefinite
period of time.

You must comply with all laws and regulations that apply to you in any place in which you buy,
offer or sell any Notes or possess this offering memorandum. You must also obtain any consents,
permission or approvals that you need in order to purchase any Notes. The Issuers and the initial
purchasers are not responsible for your compliance with these legal requirements. The Issuers are not
making any representation to you regarding the legality of your investment in the Notes under any legal
investment or similar law or regulation.

The distribution of this offering memorandum and the offer and the sale of the Notes may be
restricted by law in certain jurisdictions. Persons into whose possession this offering memorandum or any
of the Notes come must inform themselves about, and observe, any such restrictions. See “Plan of
Distribution.”

We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefor on or about the
settlement date specified on the cover page of this offering memorandum, which will be the    business
day following the date of pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle being referred to as “T+  ”). Under

iii


-----

SEC Rule 15c6-1 under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”),
trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to
any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade their Notes more
than two business days prior to the scheduled settlement date will be required, by virtue of the fact that
the Notes initially will settle in T+ , to specify an alternate settlement cycle at the time of any such trade
to prevent a failed settlement and should consult their own advisors. See “Plan of Distribution.”

**PROHIBITION OF SALES TO EEA RETAIL INVESTORS—The Notes are not intended to**
be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made
available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one
(or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; (ii) a customer within
the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as
defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of
Regulation (EU) 2017/1129. Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU)
No. 1286/2014, as amended (the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise
making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling
the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the
PRIIPs Regulation.

**PROHIBITION OF SALES TO UK RETAIL INVESTORS—The Notes are not intended to**
be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made
available to any retail investor in the UK. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one
(or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it
forms part of domestic law in the UK by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as
amended, the “EUWA”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the Financial Services
and Markets Act 2000 (as amended, the “FSMA”) and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to
implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as
defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law in
the UK by virtue of the EUWA; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of Regulation (EU)
2017/1129 as it forms part of domestic law in the UK by virtue of the EUWA. Consequently, no key
information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 as it forms part of domestic law in the
UK by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise
making them available to retail investors in the UK has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the
Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful under the UK
PRIIPs Regulation.

**EU MiFID II product governance/Professional investors and ECPs only target market—**
Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in
respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible
counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for
distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person
subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration
the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for
undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the
manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**UK MiFIR product governance/Professional Investors and ECPs only target market—**
Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in
respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that (i) the target market for the Notes is only eligible
counterparties, as defined in the FCA Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook, and professional
clients as defined in Regulation (EU) No. 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law in the UK by virtue

iv


-----

of the EUWA (“UK MiFIR”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties
and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the
Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment;
however, a distributor subject to the FCA Handbook Product Intervention and Product Governance
Sourcebook (the “UK MiFIR Product Governance Rules”) is responsible for undertaking its own target
market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers target market
assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**Stabilization**

IN CONNECTION WITH THE ISSUANCE OF THE NOTES, HSBC BANK PLC (THE
“STABILIZING MANAGER”) (OR ANY PERSON ACTING ON BEHALF OF THE STABILIZING
MANAGER) MAY OVER-ALLOT NOTES OR EFFECT TRANSACTIONS WITH A VIEW TO
SUPPORTING THE MARKET PRICE OF THE NOTES AT A LEVEL HIGHER THAN THAT
WHICH MIGHT OTHERWISE PREVAIL. HOWEVER, STABILIZATION MAY NOT
NECESSARILY OCCUR. ANY STABILIZATION ACTION MAY BEGIN ON OR AFTER THE
DATE ON WHICH ADEQUATE PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF THE TERMS OF THE OFFER OF THE
NOTES IS MADE AND, IF BEGUN, MAY CEASE AT ANY TIME, BUT IT MUST END NO LATER
THAN THE EARLIER OF 30 DAYS AFTER THE ISSUE DATE OF THE NOTES AND 60 DAYS
AFTER THE DATE OF THE ALLOTMENT OF THE NOTES.

**Recent Developments**

_2018 Revolving Credit Facility Extension_

Effective as of July 14, 2023, the Company replaced its existing revolving commitments, having an aggregate
principal amount of $2.0 billion, with two classes of revolving commitments, having an aggregate principal amount of
$1,670.0 million available in dollars and certain other currencies and €300.0 million available in euros (the “New
Revolving Credit Facility”). The resulting classes of revolving commitments have substantially the same terms as the
previously existing revolving commitments, except that (i) the New Revolving Credit Facility will mature in July 2028,
(ii) revolving loans made pursuant thereto that bear interest at the adjusted term SOFR rate will have a credit spread
adjustment of 0.10% for all interest periods, (iii) in addition to S&P and Moody’s, Fitch will be a relevant rating agency
for purposes of the collateral release provisions (which provisions will apply for so long as, subject to the satisfaction of
certain other conditions, the Company’s applicable credit rating is an investment grade rating from no less than two of
such rating agencies) and the interest rates and fees applicable to the New Revolving Credit Facility and (iv) certain
covenants will cease to apply during a collateral release period.

_6.625% Senior Secured Notes Issuance and 2018 Term B Facility Payment_

On July 26, 2023, the Issuers issued, at par, an aggregate principal amount of $750.0 million of 6.625% Senior
Secured Notes due 2030 in a private offering. The Company used the net proceeds from the 6.625% Senior Secured
Notes to fully repay its U.S. dollar variable interest rate loans outstanding and to repay a pro rata portion of its euro

1


-----

variable interest rate loans outstanding under its existing senior secured “term B” credit facility due April 2025 (the
“2018 Term B Facility”). Additionally, in August 2023, the Company repaid €408.0 million of the borrowings
outstanding under the 2018 Term B Facility with borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.

We collectively refer to the transactions described under the headings “—Recent Developments—2018
Revolving Credit Facility Extension” and “—Recent Developments—6.625% Senior Secured Notes Issuance and 2018
Term B Facility Payment” as the “Recent Developments Refinancing Transactions.”

in Wella to investment firm IGF Wealth Management for $150.0 million (the “July 2023 Wella Transaction”). The
closing of the transaction is subject to, among other things, completion of due diligence and the satisfaction of certain
closing conditions, including the approval of the transaction by KKR. If the transaction closes, the Company intends to
use the net proceeds to repay a portion of the borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, without a
reduction in commitment. Assuming the transaction closes, the Company would retain a 22.3% stake in Wella. The
information in this offering memorandum does not give effect to the July 2023 Wella Transaction.

**Optional Redemption .........................................** The Issuers may redeem some or all of the Notes at any
time prior to     , 2025 at a redemption price equal to
100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption
date, plus a “make-whole premium,” as described under
“Description of Notes—Optional Redemption.” At any
time on or after       , 2025, the Issuers may redeem
some or all of the Notes at the applicable redemption
prices described under “Description of Notes—Optional
Redemption,” plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any,
to, but excluding, the redemption date.

Additionally, from time to time prior to       , 2025,
the Issuers may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate
principal amount of the Notes using the net cash
proceeds from certain equity offerings at the applicable
redemption price set forth under “Description of
Notes—Optional Redemption,” plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.

**Guarantors ..........................................................** Each of the Company’s wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries
(other than the Co-Issuers) that guarantees our
obligations under the Existing Credit Facilities, the
Existing Secured Notes and certain other material

5


-----

indebtedness will fully and unconditionally guarantee
the Notes on a joint and several basis.

Each of the guarantees will be a senior secured
obligation of each Guarantor and will be:

                         - equal in right of payment with all existing and
future senior indebtedness of such Guarantor,
including its guarantees of the Existing Credit
Facilities and the Existing Notes;

                         - effectively pari passu with all existing and future
indebtedness of such Guarantor that is secured by
a first-priority lien on the Collateral, including its
obligations under its guarantees of the Existing
Credit Facilities and the Existing Secured Notes,
to the extent of the value of the Collateral;

                         - senior in right of payment to any future
subordinated indebtedness of such Guarantor;

                         - effectively senior to all existing and future
indebtedness of such Guarantor that is unsecured,
including its guarantees of, or that is secured by
junior liens on the Collateral, to the extent of the
value of the Collateral; and

                         - effectively junior to any indebtedness of such
Guarantor that is secured by assets that are not
Collateral, to the extent of the value of such assets.

The guarantees will be subject to release under certain
circumstances. See “Description of Notes—
Guarantees.”

**Security ..............................................................** The Notes and the guarantees will be secured on a first
lien basis by substantially all tangible and intangible
assets of the Issuers and the Guarantors, other than
Excluded Assets (as defined in “Description of Notes—
Security”) (collectively, the “Collateral”), subject to
permitted liens. See “Description of Notes—Security.”

No appraisal of the value of the Collateral has been
made in connection with this offering, and the value of
the Collateral in the event of liquidation may be
materially different from its book value. The fair market
value of the Collateral is subject to fluctuations based on
factors that include, among others, the condition of our
industry, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly
sale, general economic conditions and the availability of
buyers. The amount to be received upon a sale of the
Collateral would also be dependent on numerous
factors, including, but not limited to, the actual fair
market value of the Collateral at such time and the

6


-----

timing and the manner of the sale. By its nature,
portions of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have
no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly,
there can be no assurance that the Collateral can be sold
in a short period of time or in an orderly manner. In
addition, in the event of a bankruptcy, your ability to
realize upon any of the Collateral may be subject to
certain bankruptcy law limitations. The liens on all or a
portion of the Collateral may also be released in certain
circumstances. As a result, in the event of a liquidation
of the Collateral, the proceeds may not be sufficient to
satisfy the obligations under the Notes, the Existing
Secured Notes and the Existing Credit Facilities. See
“Description of Notes—Security—General” and
“Description of Notes—Covenant Suspension When
Notes Obtain Investment Grade Rating.”

**Intercreditor Agreement ...................................** The Issuers will be party to an intercreditor agreement
(the “Intercreditor Agreement”) with the Collateral
Agent (as defined below) for the Notes, the collateral
agent under our Existing Credit Facilities (the “Credit
Agreement Agent”) and the respective collateral agents
for the Existing Secured Notes. The Intercreditor
Agreement will govern the relative rights and remedies
with respect to the Collateral of the Credit Agreement
Agent on behalf of itself, the administrative agent and
the lenders under the Existing Credit Facilities, the
respective collateral agents for and the holders of the
Existing Secured Notes, the Collateral Agent and the
holders of the Notes and the holders of any other firstpriority obligations. See “Description of Notes—
Security—Intercreditor Agreement.”

**Priority ................................................................** The Notes will be secured senior obligations of the
Issuers and will be:

                         - equal in right of payment with all existing and
future senior indebtedness of the Issuers, including
their obligations under the Existing Credit
Facilities and the Existing Notes;

                         - effectively pari passu with all existing and future
indebtedness of the Issuers that is secured by a
first-priority lien on the Collateral, including their
obligations under the Existing Credit Facilities
and the Existing Secured Notes, to the extent of
the value of the Collateral;

                         - senior in right of payment to any future
subordinated indebtedness of the Issuers;

                         - effectively senior to all existing and future
indebtedness of the Issuers that is unsecured,
including the Issuers’ obligations under the
Existing Unsecured Notes, or that is secured by

7


-----

junior liens on the Collateral, to the extent of the
value of the Collateral;

                         - structurally subordinated to all liabilities of any of
the Company’s subsidiaries (other than the CoIssuers) that do not guarantee the Notes; and

                         - effectively junior to any indebtedness of the
Issuers that is secured by assets that are not
Collateral, to the extent of the value of such assets.

As of June 30, 2023, after giving effect to the Recent
Developments Refinancing Transactions, and the
offering of the Notes offered hereby and the use of
proceeds therefrom described under “Use of Proceeds,”
our total consolidated indebtedness would have been
approximately $4.3 billion (none of which would have
been subordinated), of which approximately $3.6 billion
would have been secured indebtedness.

Our guarantor subsidiaries under our Existing Credit
Agreement (as defined below) include the Co-Issuers
and our other wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries (the “U.S.
Subsidiaries”). Our guarantor subsidiaries under our
Existing Credit Agreement include our U.S. subsidiaries
other than Coty DTC Holdings, LLC, Coty International
LLC, Coty Operations Americas LLC, DLI International
Holding I LLC, DLI International Holding II Corp.,
King Kylie, LLC and its subsidiaries, Launch Beauty
LLC and Rimmel Inc.

For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, the U.S.
Subsidiaries had net revenues to third parties from
continuing operations of $1,550.4 million. In addition,
as of June 30, 2023, the U.S. Subsidiaries had long-lived
assets of $3,559.5 million. Long-lived assets include
property and equipment, goodwill and other intangible
assets.

**Repurchase of Notes upon a Change of Control**

**Triggering Event ............................................** If we experience specific kinds of change of control

triggering events with respect to the Notes, the Issuers
will be required to offer to repurchase all or part of the
Notes at 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued
and unpaid interest, if any, to but excluding the date of
redemption. See “Description of Notes—Repurchase of
Notes Upon a Change of Control Triggering Event.”

**Asset Sales ...........................................................** If the Company or its restricted subsidiaries (which
include the Co-Issuers) engage in certain asset sales, the
Company or its restricted subsidiaries generally must
either invest the net proceeds from such asset sales in
the Company’s business within a specific period of

8


-----

time, prepay certain of its or the Guarantors’ debt or
make an offer to purchase a principal amount of the
Notes with the specified excess net proceeds, subject to
certain exceptions. The purchase price of the Notes in
any such offer will be 100% of their principal amount
plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but
excluding, the repurchase date. See “Description of
Notes—Certain Covenants—Asset Sales.”

**Certain Covenants ..............................................** The Notes will be issued under an indenture (the
“Indenture”) that contains covenants that, among other
things, limit the Company’s ability, and the ability of its
restricted subsidiaries (which include the Co-Issuers),
to:

                          - incur additional indebtedness, guarantee
indebtedness or issue disqualified stock or, in
the case of such subsidiaries, preferred stock;

                          - pay dividends on, repurchase or make
distributions in respect of their capital stock or
make other restricted payments;

                          - make certain investments or acquisitions;

                          - sell, transfer or otherwise convey certain assets;

                          - create liens and enter into sale and leaseback
transactions;

                          - enter into agreements restricting certain
subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends or make
other intercompany transfers;

                          - consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of
all or substantially all of the assets of the
Company and its restricted subsidiaries;

                          - enter into certain transactions with affiliates;
and

                          - prepay certain kinds of indebtedness.

The covenants will be subject to a number of exceptions
and qualifications. For more details, see “Description of
Notes—Certain Covenants.” In addition, most of these
covenants, the guarantees and the Liens securing the
Collateral will be suspended if the Notes have
investment grade ratings from at least two of Moody’s
Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”), S&P Global
Ratings (“S&P”) and Fitch, Inc. (“Fitch”) and no default
has occurred and is continuing.

**No Prior Market / Listing ...................................** The Notes are a new issue of securities for which there
currently is no market. In addition, the Notes are subject
to certain restrictions on resale and transfer as described
under “Transfer Restrictions.” We intend to apply for
the listing of a permission to deal in the Notes on the
Official List of TISE. However, we cannot guarantee
that the application to list the Notes on the Official List
of TISE will be approved as of the issue date or any date

9


-----

thereafter that the permission to deal in the Notes will be
granted or that the listing of the Notes will be
maintained, and settlement of the Notes is not
conditioned on obtaining this listing. TISE is not a
regulated market for the purposes of MiFID II. This
offering memorandum and the document constituting
the Notes together form a “Listing Document” for the
purposes of the Listing Rules maintained by the
Authority. Certain of the initial purchasers have advised
us that they intend to make a market in the Notes as
permitted by applicable law. They are not obligated,
however, to make a market in the Notes, and the ability
or interest of the initial purchasers to make a market in
the Notes may be impacted by changes in any regulatory
requirements applicable to the marketing, holding and
trading of, and issuing quotations with respect to, the
Notes (including as a result of regulatory developments
such as the SEC’s interpretation of Rule 15c2-11 under
the Exchange Act and its application to debt securities),
and any market-making may be discontinued at any time
at such initial purchaser’s sole discretion. Accordingly,
no assurance can be given as to the development or
liquidity of any market for the Notes.

**Transfer Restrictions ..........................................** The Notes have not been and will not be registered
under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any
other jurisdiction and may not be offered or sold within
the United States to, or for the benefit of, U.S. persons
(as defined in Regulation S) except in a transaction
exempt from, or not subject to, the registration
requirements of the Securities Act. See “Transfer
Restrictions.”

**No Registration Rights .......................................** The Notes and the guarantees will not be entitled to any
registration rights, and the Issuers do not intend to file a
registration statement for the resale of the Notes or to
offer to exchange the Notes for registered Notes under
the U.S. federal or state securities laws or under the
securities laws of any other jurisdiction.

**Use of Proceeds ...................................................** We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering to
repay a portion of the borrowings outstanding under the
Revolving Credit Facility, without a reduction in
commitment. We will use cash on hand to pay the
offering expenses payable by us in connection with this
offering. See “Use of Proceeds.” Certain of the initial
purchasers or their respective affiliates act as agents
and/or lenders under our Existing Credit Facilities and
therefore may receive a portion of the proceeds of this

**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**

To supplement the financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, we use non-GAAP financial
measures for continuing operations and Coty Inc., including adjusted operating income (loss), adjusted EBITDA,
adjusted net income (loss), and adjusted net income (loss) attributable to Coty Inc. to common stockholders
(collectively, the “Adjusted Performance Measures”). The reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the
most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are shown in tables
below. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for or superior
to, financial measures reported in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, these non-GAAP financial measures have
limitations in that they do not reflect all the items associated with the operations of the business as determined in
accordance with GAAP. Other companies, including companies in the beauty industry, may calculate similarly titled
non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative
purposes.

Despite the limitations of these non-GAAP financial measures, our management uses the Adjusted Performance
Measures as key metrics in the evaluation of our performance and annual budgets and to benchmark performance of our
business against our competitors. The following are examples of how these Adjusted Performance Measures are utilized
by our management:

      - strategic plans and annual budgets are prepared using the Adjusted Performance Measures;

      - senior management receives a monthly analysis comparing budget to actual operating results that is
prepared using the Adjusted Performance Measures; and

      - senior management’s annual compensation is calculated, in part, by using some of the Adjusted
Performance Measures.

In addition, our financial covenant compliance calculations under our debt agreements are substantially derived
from these Adjusted Performance Measures.

Our management believes that Adjusted Performance Measures are useful to investors in their assessment of our
operating performance and the valuation of the Company. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures address
questions we routinely receive from analysts and investors and, in order to ensure that all investors have access to the
same data, our management has determined that it is appropriate to make this data available to all investors. The
Adjusted Performance Measures exclude the impact of certain items (as further described below) and provide
supplemental information regarding our operating performance. By disclosing these non-GAAP financial measures, our
management intends to provide investors with a supplemental comparison of our operating results and trends for the
periods presented. Our management believes that these measures are also useful to investors as such measures allow
investors to evaluate our performance using the same metrics that our management uses to evaluate past performance
and prospects for future performance. We provide disclosure of the effects of these non-GAAP financial measures by
presenting the corresponding measure prepared in conformity with GAAP in our financial statements, and by providing

13


-----

a reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP measure so that investors may understand the adjustments made in arriving
at the non-GAAP financial measures and use the information to perform their own analyses.

Adjusted operating income / adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations excludes restructuring costs and
business structure realignment programs, amortization, acquisition- and divestiture-related costs and acquisition
accounting impacts, stock-based compensation, and asset impairment charges and other adjustments as described below.
For adjusted EBITDA, in addition to the preceding, we exclude adjusted depreciation as defined below. We do not
consider these items to be reflective of our core operating performance due to the variability of such items from period
to period in terms of size, nature and significance. They are primarily incurred to realign our operating structure and
integrate new acquisitions, and implement divestitures of components of our business, and fluctuate based on specific
facts and circumstances. Additionally, Adjusted net income attributable to Coty Inc. and Adjusted net income
attributable to Coty Inc. per common share are adjusted for certain interest and other (income) expense items and
preferred stock deemed dividends, as described below, and the related tax effects of each of the items used to derive
Adjusted net income as such charges are not used by our management in assessing our operating performance period to
period.

Adjusted Performance Measures reflect adjustments based on the following items:

      - Costs related to acquisition and divestiture activities: We have excluded acquisition- and divestiturerelated costs and the accounting impacts such as those related to transaction costs and costs associated
with the revaluation of acquired inventory in connection with business combinations because these
costs are unique to each transaction. Additionally, for divestitures, we exclude write-offs of assets that
are no longer recoverable and contract related costs due to the divestiture. The nature and amount of
such costs vary significantly based on the size and timing of the acquisitions and divestitures, and the
maturities of the businesses being acquired or divested. Also, the size, complexity and/or volume of
past transactions, which often drives the magnitude of such expenses, may not be indicative of the size,
complexity and/or volume of any future acquisitions or divestitures.

      - Restructuring and other business realignment costs: We have excluded costs associated with
restructuring and business structure realignment programs to allow for comparable financial results to
historical operations and forward-looking guidance. In addition, the nature and amount of such charges
vary significantly based on the size and timing of the programs. By excluding the referenced expenses
from our non-GAAP financial measures, our management is able to further evaluate our ability to
utilize existing assets and estimate their long-term value. Furthermore, our management believes that
the adjustment of these items supplements the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to
assess the sustainability of our operating performance.

      - Asset impairment charges: We have excluded the impact of asset impairments as such non-cash
amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and/or
size of acquisitions. Our management believes that the adjustment of these items supplements the
GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of our operating
performance.

      - Amortization expense: We have excluded the impact of amortization of finite-lived intangible assets, as
such non-cash amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the
timing and/or size of acquisitions. Our management believes that the adjustment of these items
supplements the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of our
operating performance. Although we exclude amortization of intangible assets from our non-GAAP
expenses, our management believes that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible
assets contribute to revenue generation. Amortization of intangible assets that relate to past acquisitions
will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized. Any future
acquisitions may result in the amortization of additional intangible assets.

14


-----

- Gain on sale and termination of brand assets: We have excluded the impact of gain on sale and
termination of brand assets as such amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are
significantly impacted by the size of the sale and termination of brand assets.

- Costs related to market exit: We have excluded the impact of direct incremental costs related to our
decision to wind down our business operations in Russia. We believe that these direct and incremental
costs are inconsistent and infrequent in nature. Consequently, our management believes that the
adjustment of these items supplements the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess
the sustainability of our operating performance.

- Gains on sale of real estate: We have excluded the impact of gains on sale of real estate as such amounts
are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the size of the sale. Our
management believes that the adjustment of these items supplements the GAAP information with a
measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance.

- Stock-based compensation: Although stock-based compensation is a key incentive offered to our
employees, we have excluded the effect of these expenses from the calculation of adjusted operating
income and adjusted EBITDA. This is due to their primarily non-cash nature; in addition, the amount
and timing of these expenses may be highly variable and unpredictable, which may negatively affect
comparability between periods.

- Depreciation and Adjusted depreciation: Our adjusted operating income excludes the impact of
accelerated depreciation for certain restructuring projects that affect the expected useful lives of
Property, Plant and Equipment, as such charges vary significantly based on the size and timing of the
programs. Further, we have excluded adjusted depreciation, which represents depreciation expense net
of accelerated depreciation charges, from our adjusted EBITDA. Our management believes that the
adjustment of these items supplements the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess
the sustainability of our operating performance.

- Other (income) expense: We have excluded the impact of pension curtailment (gains) and losses and
pension settlements as such events are triggered by our restructuring and other business realignment
activities and the amount of such charges vary significantly based on the size and timing of the
programs. Further, we have excluded the change in fair value of the investment in Wella, as our
management believes that these unrealized (gains) and losses do not reflect our underlying ongoing
business, and the adjustment of such impact helps investors and others compare and analyze
performance from period to period. We have excluded the gain on the exchange of Series B Preferred
Stock. Such transactions do not reflect our operating results and we have excluded the impact as our
management believes that the adjustment of these items supplements the GAAP information with a
measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance.

- Noncontrolling interest: This adjustment represents the after-tax impact of the non-GAAP adjustments
included in Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests based on the relevant noncontrolling
interest percentage.

- Tax: This adjustment represents the impact of the tax effect of the pretax items excluded from adjusted
net income. The tax impact of the non-GAAP adjustments is based on the tax rates related to the
jurisdiction in which the adjusted items are received or incurred. Additionally, adjustments are made for
the tax impact of any intra-entity transfer of assets and liabilities.

- Deemed Preferred Stock Dividends: We have excluded preferred stock deemed dividends related to the
First Exchange and the Second Exchange (as disclosed and defined in Note 13—Equity Investments in
our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K) from our calculation of adjusted net income attributable to

15


-----

Coty Inc. These deemed dividends are nonmonetary in nature and the transactions were entered into to
simplify our capital structure and do not reflect our underlying ongoing business. Management believes
that this adjustment helps investors and others compare and analyze our performance from period to
period.

**Risk Factors**

_Investing in the Notes involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks_
_described below (as such risk factors may be updated from time to time in our public filings), as well as_
_the other information included in or incorporated by reference into this offering memorandum, before_
_making a decision to invest in the Notes. The risks described below and incorporated by reference are not_
_the only risks that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we_
_currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. Any of these risks may have a_
_material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations,_
_profitability, cash flows or liquidity. In such a case, you may lose all or part of your investment in the_
_Notes._

**Risks Relating to This Offering and the Notes**

**_We have taken on significant debt, which may adversely affect our business._**

We have a substantial amount of indebtedness. As of June 30, 2023, after giving effect to the
Recent Developments Refinancing Transactions, and the offering of the Notes offered hereby and the use
of proceeds therefrom described under “Use of Proceeds,” our total consolidated indebtedness would have
been approximately $4.3 billion, all of which we will need to refinance or repay. There can be no
assurances we will be able to refinance our indebtedness in the future (1) on commercially reasonable
terms, (2) on terms, including with respect to interest rates, as favorable as our current debt or (3) at all.

Our debt burden could have important consequences, including increasing our vulnerability to
general adverse economic and industry conditions; limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to,
changes in our business and our industry; requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of any cash
flow from operations to the payment of principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness, thereby reducing
the availability of such cash flow to fund our operations, growth strategy, working capital, capital
expenditures, future business opportunities and other general corporate purposes; exposing us to the risk
of increased interest rates with respect to any borrowings that are at variable rates of interest; restricting
us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures; limiting our ability
to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, research and development, debt
service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; limiting our ability to adjust to
changing market conditions; and placing us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors who
are less highly leveraged. In addition, a significant portion of our cash and investments are held outside
the United States, and we may not be able to service our debt without undergoing the costs of repatriating
those funds.

**_The instruments that govern, or will govern, our debt contain, or will contain, various covenants that_**
**_impose restrictions on us that may affect our ability to operate our business._**

Instruments that govern, or will govern, our indebtedness, including the Existing Credit
Agreement, the indentures governing the Existing Secured Notes (the “Existing Secured Indentures”), the
indenture governing the Existing Unsecured Notes (together with the Existing Secured Indentures, the
“Existing Indentures”) and the Indenture governing the Notes, impose or will impose operating and
financial restrictions on our activities. These restrictions limit or prohibit our ability and the ability of us
and our restricted subsidiaries (which include the Co-Issuers) to, among other things:

  - incur indebtedness or grant liens on our property to secure indebtedness;

  - dispose of assets or equity;

  - make acquisitions or investments;


-----

  - make dividends, distributions or other restricted payments;

  - effect affiliate transactions;

  - enter into sale and leaseback transactions; and

  - enter into mergers, consolidations or sales of substantially all of our assets and the assets of our

subsidiaries.

In addition, the Existing Credit Agreement includes a financial covenant that requires us to
maintain a total net leverage ratio (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement) equal to or less than
certain levels set forth in the Existing Credit Agreement.

These restrictions on our ability to operate our business could seriously harm our business by,
among other things, limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, merger and acquisition and other
corporate opportunities.

Further, various risks, uncertainties and events beyond our control could affect our ability to
comply with these covenants. Failure to comply with any of the covenants in our financing agreements
could result in an event of default under those agreements and under any other agreements containing
cross-default provisions. Such an event of default, if not waived or cured, would permit lenders to
accelerate the maturity of the debt under these agreements and to foreclose upon any collateral securing
the debt (including the Collateral securing the Notes offered hereby, the Existing Secured Notes and the
Existing Credit Facilities). Under these circumstances, we or the Co-Issuers might not have sufficient
funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations, including our obligations under the Existing
Credit Agreement, the Existing Indentures and the Indenture. In addition, the limitations imposed by
financing agreements on our ability to incur additional debt and to take other actions might significantly
impair our ability to obtain other financing. We cannot assure you that we will be granted waivers or
amendments to these agreements if for any reason we are unable to comply with these agreements or that
we will be able to refinance our debt on terms acceptable to us, or at all.

**_If we default on our obligations under our other indebtedness, we may not be able to make payments_**
**_on the Notes._**

Any default under the agreements governing our indebtedness, including a default under the
Indenture, the Existing Credit Agreement or the Existing Indentures that is not waived by the required
percentage of noteholders or lenders, as applicable, could impede our ability to pay principal and
premium amounts, if any, and interest on the Notes and substantially decrease the market value of the
Notes. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow and are otherwise unable to obtain funds
necessary to meet required payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, or if
we otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants, including financial and operating covenants, in
the agreements governing our indebtedness, we could be in default under the terms of the agreements
governing such indebtedness. In the event of such a default, the holders of such indebtedness in the
applicable required percentage could elect to declare all the funds borrowed thereunder to be due and
payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, lenders under our existing revolving credit facility in
the applicable required percentage could elect to terminate their commitments and lenders under the
Existing Credit Facilities and the holders of the Notes offered hereby and the Existing Notes in the
applicable required percentage could institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets that constitute
the Collateral, and we may seek protection under the bankruptcy code.

If we breach our covenants under the Indenture, the Existing Credit Agreement, the Existing
Indentures or any agreements governing future senior credit facilities or other indebtedness, we may need

20


-----

to request waivers from the required percentage of lenders or required percentage of noteholders to avoid
being in default. If we are unable to obtain a waiver from the lenders or noteholders, we would be in
default under the instrument governing that indebtedness, the lenders or noteholders could exercise their
rights as described above, and we may seek protection under the bankruptcy code.

**_Our ability to service and repay the Notes will be dependent on the cash flow generated by our_**
**_subsidiaries and events beyond our control._**

The Company’s only material asset is its interest in its subsidiaries, including the Co-Issuers. The
Company conducts its operations through, and most of its assets are owned by, its subsidiaries, including
the Co-Issuers, and its operating income and cash flow are generated by its subsidiaries, including the CoIssuers. As a result, repayment of the Notes will depend on our subsidiaries’, including the Co-Issuers’,
generation of cash flow, which will, in turn, depend principally upon future operating performance, and
our subsidiaries’, including the Co-Issuers’, ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt
repayment or otherwise. If our operating subsidiaries, including the Co-Issuers, experience sufficiently
adverse changes in their financial position or results of operations, or we otherwise become unable to pay
our debts as they become due and obtain further credit, this could result in the commencement of
insolvency proceedings. Any such proceedings would have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are
beyond our control, will affect our ability to make payments on our debt. In particular, due to the seasonal
nature of the beauty industry, with the highest levels of consumer demand generally occurring during the
holiday buying season in our second fiscal quarter, our subsidiaries’ cash flow in the second half of the
fiscal year may be less than in the first half of the fiscal year, which may affect our ability to satisfy our
debt service obligations, including to service the Notes offered hereby. In addition, we earn a significant
amount of our operating income, and hold a significant portion of our cash and investments, in our
foreign subsidiaries outside the United States. As of June 30, 2023, the amount of cash and cash
equivalents held outside the United States by our foreign subsidiaries was $161.3 million. If our U.S.
subsidiaries, including the Co-Issuers, are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt
service obligations, including to service the Notes offered hereby, we may need to repatriate additional
earnings and we may be subject to a higher effective tax rate. If we do not generate sufficient cash flow to
satisfy our debt service obligations, including payments on the Notes, we may have to undertake
alternative financing plans, such as refinancing or restructuring our debt, selling assets, reducing or
delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital. Our ability to restructure or refinance
our debt will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of
our debt could result in higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants,
which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of the Indenture, the Existing Credit
Agreement, the Existing Indentures or any existing debt instruments or future debt instruments that we
may enter into may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. The inability of our subsidiaries
to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations, including the inability to service
the Notes offered hereby, or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms, could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, profitability, cash flows
or liquidity and may impact our ability to satisfy our obligations in respect of the Notes.

**_We may incur substantially more debt, including secured debt, or take other actions that may affect our_**
**_ability to satisfy our obligations under the Notes._**

Although the terms of the Indenture will restrict, and the terms of the Existing Credit Agreement
and the Existing Indentures restrict, our and our subsidiaries’ ability to incur additional indebtedness and
liens securing indebtedness, such restrictions are subject to several exceptions and qualifications.
Accordingly, we will be able to incur additional indebtedness, including secured debt, as permitted by the

21


-----

terms of the Indenture, the Existing Credit Agreement and the Existing Indentures. Such additional
indebtedness may be substantial. Our ability to recapitalize, incur additional debt and take a number of
other actions that are not prohibited by the terms of the Indenture, the Existing Credit Agreement and the
Existing Indentures could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on the Notes when
due, and may also require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to
payments on our other indebtedness, which would reduce the availability of cash flow to fund our
operations, working capital and capital expenditures. In addition, if we incur any additional indebtedness
that ranks pari passu in right of payment to the Notes, the holders of that debt will be able to share ratably
with the holders of the Notes in any proceeds distributed in connection with any insolvency, liquidation,
reorganization, dissolution or other winding up of us. If our subsidiaries that are not guaranteeing the
Notes (other than the Co-Issuers) incur any indebtedness, all of such debt will be structurally senior to the
Notes, and the holders of that debt will benefit prior to the holders of the Notes in any proceeds
distributed in connection with any insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding up
of any such entity.

**_Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service_**
**_obligations to increase._**

Borrowings under our Existing Credit Facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose us to
interest rate risk. As of June 30, 2023, after giving effect to the Recent Developments Refinancing
Transactions, the offering of the Notes offered hereby and the use of proceeds therefrom described under
“Use of Proceeds,” $0.2 billion, or approximately 4% of our total debt, would have been at variable rates
of interest. If interest rates were to increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness
referred to above would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net
income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly
decrease. For every 10% increase or decrease in our interest rates, our income before income taxes for the
fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 would have changed by approximately $1.0 million, assuming that all
other variables stayed the same. We are currently party to, and in the future, we may enter into additional,
interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments, in order to
reduce interest rate volatility. However, we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our
variable rate indebtedness, and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk.

**_Our credit ratings may not reflect the risks of investing in the Notes._**

Our credit ratings are an assessment by rating agencies of our ability to pay our debts when due
and include many subjective factors. Consequently, real or anticipated changes in our credit ratings will
generally affect the value of the Notes. Also, these credit ratings may not reflect the potential impact of
risks relating to the structure or marketing of the Notes. Agency ratings are not a recommendation to buy,
sell or hold any security and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the issuing organization. Each
agency’s rating should be evaluated independently of any other agency’s rating. There can be no
assurance that our credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will
not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency, if, in that rating agency’s judgment,
circumstances so warrant. There can also be no assurance that our credit ratings will reflect all of the
factors that would be important to holders of the Notes. Actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in
our credit ratings, including any announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade,
could affect the value of the Notes, may increase our borrowing costs and may negatively impact our
ability to incur additional debt. The reports of the rating agencies do not form a part of, and are not
incorporated by reference into, this offering memorandum.

22


-----

**_Redemption may adversely affect your return on the Notes._**

The Notes are redeemable at the option of the Issuers, and therefore the Issuers may choose to
redeem the Notes at times when prevailing interest rates are relatively low. As a result, you may not be
able to reinvest the proceeds you receive from the redemption in a comparable security at an effective
interest rate as high as the interest rate on your Notes being redeemed.

**_The Issuers may not be able to purchase the Notes upon the occurrence of a change of control_**
**_triggering event, which would result in a default under the Indenture and would adversely affect our_**
**_business and financial condition._**

Upon the occurrence of a “Change of Control Triggering Event” within the meaning of the
Indenture with respect to the Notes, the Issuers will be required to repurchase all or any part of such
holder’s Notes of such series at 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if
any, to but excluding the purchase date. In addition, a change of control triggering event may also
accelerate obligations to repay amounts outstanding under our and our subsidiaries’ (including the CoIssuers’) indebtedness, including the Existing Credit Facilities, and require us (or our subsidiaries,
including the Co-Issuers), among other things, to make similar offerings in respect of our and their
outstanding indebtedness, including the Existing Indentures. The Issuers may not have sufficient funds
available to make any such required repayments and/or repurchases, and the Issuers may be unable to
receive distributions or advances from our subsidiaries in the future sufficient to meet such repayment
and/or repurchase obligations. In addition, restrictions under future debt instruments may not permit the
Issuers to repay or repurchase the Notes or any other such indebtedness upon a change of control
triggering event. If the Issuers fail to repurchase the Notes in that circumstance, they will be in default
under the Indenture governing the Notes and could be in default under our Existing Credit Facilities and
the Existing Indentures. If, due to a default, the repayment of related indebtedness were to be accelerated
after any applicable notice or grace periods, the Issuers may not have sufficient funds to repay such
indebtedness or the Notes. See “Description of Notes—Repurchase of Notes upon a Change of Control
Triggering Event.”

**_Some significant restructuring transactions may not constitute a change of control triggering event, in_**
**_which case the Issuers would not be obligated to offer to purchase the affected Notes._**

Upon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event within the meaning of the Indenture
with respect to the Notes, holders of the Notes have the right to require the Issuers to purchase their
Notes. However, the change of control triggering event provisions will not afford protection to holders of
Notes in the event of certain transactions. For example, transactions such as leveraged recapitalizations,
refinancings, restructurings or acquisitions initiated by us may not constitute a change of control
triggering event requiring us to purchase the Notes. Further, various transactions might not constitute a
change of control triggering event under the Notes but could constitute a change of control triggering
event as defined under our other debt. In the event of any such transaction, the holders would not have the
right to require the Issuers to purchase the Notes, even though such transaction could increase the amount
of our indebtedness, or otherwise adversely affect our capital structure or any credit ratings, thereby
adversely affecting the holders of Notes.

**_The ability of holders of the Notes to require the Issuers to repurchase the Notes as a result of a_**
**_disposition of “substantially all” assets may be uncertain._**

The definition of change of control triggering event in the Indenture will include a phrase relating
to the sale, lease, transfer or other conveyance, in one or a series of related transactions, of “all or
substantially all” of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Although there is a
limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established

23


-----

definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of the Notes to require
the Issuers to repurchase such Notes as a result of a sale, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of less
than all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries taken as a whole to another person or group may be
uncertain.

**_Many of the covenants in the Indenture, the guarantees and liens on the Collateral will not apply to us_**
**_if the Notes have investment grade ratings from at least two of Moody’s, S&P and Fitch and no default_**
**_has occurred and is continuing._**

Many of the covenants in the Indenture, the guarantees and liens on the Collateral will not apply
to us if the Notes have investment grade ratings from at least two of Moody’s, S&P and Fitch and no
default has occurred and is continuing. There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever be rated
investment grade, or that if they are rated investment grade, that the Notes will maintain these ratings.
However, suspension of these covenants would allow us to engage in certain transactions that would not
be permitted while these covenants were in effect. To the extent the covenants are subsequently
reinstated, any such actions taken while the covenants were suspended would not result in an event of
default under the Indenture. The Notes would also become unsecured obligations of the Issuers while
rated investment grade and during such time would be effectively subordinated to the Existing Secured
Notes to the extent of the value of the collateral securing the Existing Secured Notes that is not released
upon an investment grade rating.

**_A trading market for the Notes may not develop._**

The Notes are a new issue of securities for which there currently is no market. In addition, the
Notes are subject to certain restrictions on resale and transfer as described under “Transfer Restrictions.”
We intend to apply for the listing of and permission to deal in the Notes on the Official List of TISE.
However, we cannot guarantee that the application to list the Notes on the Official List of TISE will be
approved as of the issue date or any date thereafter, that the permission to deal in the Notes will be
granted or that the listing of the Notes will be maintained, and settlement of the Notes is not conditioned
on obtaining this listing. TISE is not a regulated market for the purposes of MiFID II.

Certain of the initial purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes as
permitted by applicable law. They are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes, and the
ability or interest of the initial purchasers to make a market in the Notes may be impacted by changes in
any regulatory requirements applicable to the marketing, holding and trading of, and issuing quotations
with respect to, the Notes (including as a result of regulatory developments such as the SEC’s
interpretation of Rule 15c2-11 under the Exchange Act and its application to debt securities), and any
market-making may be discontinued at any time at such initial purchaser’s sole discretion. Accordingly,
no assurance can be given as to the development or liquidity of any market for the Notes. If a market
develops, the Notes could trade at prices that may be lower than the initial offering price of the Notes.
Further, if an active market does not develop or is not maintained, the price and liquidity of the Notes
may be adversely affected. Historically, debt markets have been subject to disruptions that have caused
substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. The market, if any, for the Notes may
not be free from similar disruptions, and any such disruptions may adversely affect the prices at which
holders of the Notes may sell their Notes. In addition, subsequent to their initial issuance, the Notes may
trade at a discount from their initial offering price, depending upon prevailing interest rates, the market
for similar notes, our performance and other factors.

24


-----

**_Not all of our subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes, and your right to receive payment on the Notes will_**
**_be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of our non-guarantor subsidiaries._**

Not all of our subsidiaries will be required to guarantee the Notes. The Notes will be guaranteed
by the Guarantors, which do not include foreign subsidiaries and certain U.S. subsidiaries excepted from
providing guarantees under the terms of the Existing Credit Agreement. Creditors of our non-guarantor
subsidiaries (other than the Co-Issuers) will generally be entitled to payment from the assets of those
subsidiaries before those assets can be distributed for the benefit of noteholders. As a result, the Notes
will be structurally subordinated to the prior payment of all of the existing and future debt and other
liabilities of our non-guarantor subsidiaries (other than the Co-Issuers). In the event of a bankruptcy,
liquidation or reorganization of any of our non-guarantor subsidiaries, holders of their indebtedness will
generally be entitled to payment of their claims from the assets of those subsidiaries before any assets are
made available for distribution to the Issuers or the Guarantors of the Notes. Our guarantor subsidiaries
under our Existing Credit Agreement include the U.S. Subsidiaries. For the fiscal years ended June 30,
2023 and 2022, the U.S. Subsidiaries had net revenues to third parties from continuing operations of
$1,550.4 million and $1,482.9 million, respectively. In addition, as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, the U.S.
Subsidiaries had long-lived assets of $3,559.5 million and $3,972.2 million, respectively. Long-lived
assets include property and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets.

Unless they are Co-Issuers or Guarantors, our subsidiaries will not have any obligation to pay
amounts due on the Notes or to make funds available for that purpose. Our subsidiaries may not be able
to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions or debt repayments to enable us to make payments in
respect of the Notes. Each such subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and may be subject to legal or
contractual restrictions that, under certain circumstances, may limit our ability to obtain cash from them.
In the event that we do not receive sufficient cash from our subsidiaries, we will be unable to make
required principal, premium, if any, and interest payments on the Notes.

**_There are restrictions on your ability to transfer or resell the Notes. In addition, holders of the Notes_**
**_will not be entitled to registration rights, and we do not currently intend to register the Notes under_**
**_applicable securities laws._**

The Notes are being offered and sold pursuant to exemptions from registration under the
Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. Therefore, you may transfer or resell the Notes in the
United States only in a transaction registered under or exempt from the registration requirements of the
Securities Act and applicable state securities laws, and you may be required to bear the risk of your
investment for an indefinite period of time. You may not offer or sell the Notes except under an
exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act, and
we do not intend to register the Notes for resale or to offer to exchange the Notes for registered notes
under the Securities Act. By purchasing the Notes, you will be deemed to have made certain
acknowledgements, representations and agreements as set forth under “Transfer Restrictions.”

**_Federal and state statutes allow courts, under specific circumstances, to avoid the Notes and the_**
**_guarantees, to require holders of the Notes to return payments received from the Issuers or the_**
**_Guarantors, and to take other actions detrimental to the holders of the Notes._**

Federal and state fraudulent transfer and conveyance statutes may apply to the issuance of the
Notes, the delivery of any guarantees of the Notes, including the guarantees by the Guarantors entered
into upon issuance of the Notes, and any subsidiary guarantees that may be entered into thereafter under
the terms of the Indenture. Under federal bankruptcy law and comparable provisions of state fraudulent
transfer or conveyance laws, which may vary from state to state, the issuance of the Notes and the
delivery of guarantees could be avoided (that is, canceled) as fraudulent transfers or conveyances if a
court determined that the Issuers, at the time they issued the Notes, or any of the Guarantors, at the time it

25


-----

delivered the applicable guarantee (or, in some jurisdictions, at the time payment became due under the
Notes or a guarantee),

(I) issued the Notes or provided the applicable guarantee, as the case may be, with the intent
of hindering, delaying or defrauding any present or future creditor; or

(II) (A) received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for issuing the
Notes or providing such guarantee, as the case may be, and

(B) (1) was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such issuance or provision,

(2) was engaged in a business or transaction for which the Issuer’s or such Guarantor’s
remaining assets constituted unreasonably small capital, or

(3) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay
such debts as they matured.

A court would likely find that the Issuers or a Guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent
value or fair consideration for the Notes or the applicable guarantee if the Issuers or such Guarantor did
not benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the Notes or such guarantee. As a general matter,
subject to the standards noted above, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the
transfer or obligation, property is transferred or an antecedent debt is secured or satisfied. If the Notes or
guarantees are avoided or limited under fraudulent transfer or other laws, any claim you may make
against the Issuers or the Guarantors for amounts payable on the Notes or guarantees, as the case may be,
will be unenforceable to the extent of such avoidance or limitation.

We cannot be certain as to the standards a court would use to determine whether the Issuers or a
Guarantor was solvent at the relevant time that, if applicable in a particular jurisdiction, may be when
payment became due under the Notes or a guarantee. Regardless of the actual standard applied by the
court, we cannot be certain that the issuance of the Notes or a guarantee would not be avoided.

The measures of insolvency for purposes of these fraudulent transfer laws will vary depending
upon the law applied in any proceeding to determine whether a fraudulent transfer has occurred.
Generally, however, the Issuers or a Guarantor would be considered insolvent if:

  - the sum of its debts, including contingent and unliquidated liabilities, was greater than the value

of its property, at a fair valuation;

  - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay

its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute
and mature; or

  - it could not pay its debts as they become due.

To the extent that a court avoids or otherwise finds the Notes or a guarantee unenforceable for
any other reason, your claims against the Issuers or the relevant Guarantor would be eliminated or limited.
In addition, the court might direct you to repay any amounts already received from the Issuers or such
Guarantor. Further, the avoidance of the Notes or a related guarantee could result in an event of default
with respect to our other debt that, in turn, could result in acceleration of such debt.

In certain circumstances, a court may subordinate claims in respect of the Notes or a guarantee to
all other debts of an Issuer or a Guarantor, or take other actions detrimental to the noteholders, based on

26


-----

equitable or other grounds. We cannot be certain as to the standards that a court might apply and whether
it might find such subordination or other actions appropriate.

If a guarantee were legally challenged, such guarantee could also be subject to the claim that,
since the guarantee was incurred for the Issuers’ benefit, and only indirectly for the benefit of the
Guarantor, the obligations of the Guarantor were incurred for less than fair consideration. A court could
thus avoid the obligations under the guarantee. Although each guarantee will contain a provision intended
to limit that Guarantor’s liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the
incurrence of obligations under its guarantee to be a fraudulent transfer, that provision may not be
effective to protect those guarantees from being avoided under fraudulent transfer law, or may reduce that
Guarantor’s obligation to an amount that effectively makes its guarantee worthless.

Even if the guarantees of the Notes remain in force, the remaining amount due and collectible
under the guarantee may not be sufficient to pay the Notes in full when due.

**_Because each Guarantor’s liability under its guarantees may be reduced to zero, avoided or released_**
**_under certain circumstances, you may not receive any payments from some or all of the Guarantors._**

You have the benefit of the guarantees of the Guarantors. However, the guarantees by the
Guarantors are limited to the maximum amount that the Guarantors are permitted to guarantee under
applicable law. As a result, a Guarantor’s liability under its guarantee could be reduced to zero, depending
on the amount of other obligations of such Guarantor. Further, under the circumstances discussed more
fully above, a court under federal or state fraudulent conveyance and transfer statutes could void the
obligations under a guarantee or further subordinate it to all other obligations of the Guarantor. In
addition, you will lose the benefit of a particular guarantee if it is released under certain circumstances
described under “Description of Notes—Guarantees.”

**_Holders of the Notes may be subject to the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, as_**
**_well as possible exchange controls, relating to the U.S. dollar and the euro._**

The initial investors in the Notes will be required to pay for the Notes in euro. Neither we nor the
initial purchasers will be obligated to assist the initial investors in obtaining euro or in converting other
currencies into euro to facilitate the payment of the purchase price for the Notes. An investment in any
security denominated in, and all payments with respect to which are to be made in, a currency other than
the currency of the country in which an investor in the Notes resides or the currency in which an investor
conducts its business or activities (the “investor’s home currency”), entails significant risks not associated
with a similar investment in a security denominated in the investor’s home currency. In the case of the
Notes offered hereby, these risks may include the possibility of:

  - significant changes in rates of exchange between the euro and the investor’s home currency; and

  - the imposition or modification of foreign exchange controls with respect to the euro or the
investor’s home currency.

We have no control over a number of factors affecting the Notes offered hereby and foreign
exchange rates, including economic, financial and political events that are important in determining the
existence, magnitude and longevity of these risks and their effects. Changes in foreign currency exchange
rates between two currencies result from the interaction over time of many factors directly or indirectly
affecting economic and political conditions in the countries issuing such currencies, and economic and
political developments globally and in other relevant countries. Foreign currency exchange rates may be
affected by, among other factors, existing and expected rates of inflation, existing and expected interest
rate levels, the balance of payments between countries, and the extent of the governmental surpluses or

27


-----

deficits in various countries. All of these factors are, in turn, sensitive to the monetary, fiscal and trade
policies pursued by the governments of various countries important to international trade and finance.
Moreover, the recent global economic volatility and the actions taken or to be taken by various national
governments in response to the volatility could significantly affect the exchange rates between the euro
and the investor’s home currency.

The exchange rate of an investor’s home currency for euro and the fluctuations in the exchange
rate that have occurred in the past are not necessarily indicative of the exchange rates or the fluctuations
therein that may occur in the future. Depreciation of the euro against the investor’s home currency would
result in a decrease in the investor’s home currency equivalent yield on a Note, in the investor’s home
currency equivalent of the principal payable at the maturity of that Note and generally in the investor’s
home currency equivalent market value of that Note. Appreciation of the euro in relation to the investor’s
home currency would have the opposite effects. The European Union or one or more of its member states
may, in the future, impose exchange controls and modify any exchange controls imposed, which controls
could affect exchange rates, as well as the availability of the euro at the time of payment of principal of,
interest on, or any redemption or additional amounts with respect to, the Notes.

This description of foreign exchange risks does not describe all the risks of an investment in
securities, including, in particular, the Notes, that are denominated or payable in a currency other than an
investor’s home currency. You should consult your own financial and legal advisors as to the risks
involved in an investment in the Notes.

**_Trading in the clearing system is subject to minimum denomination requirements._**

The Notes will be issued with a minimum denomination of €100,000 and multiple of €1,000 in
excess of €100,000. It is possible that the clearing systems may process trades that could result in
amounts being held in denominations smaller than the minimum denominations. If definitive Notes are
required to be issued in relation to such Notes in accordance with the provisions of the relevant global
notes, a holder who does not have the minimum denomination or a multiple of €1,000 in excess of
€100,000, as applicable, in its account with the relevant clearing system at the relevant time may not
receive all of its entitlement in the form of definitive Notes unless and until such time as its holding
satisfies the minimum denomination requirement.

**_In a lawsuit for payment on the Notes, an investor may bear currency exchange risk._**

The Notes will be governed by New York law. Under New York law, a New York state court rendering a
judgment on the Notes would be required to render the judgment in euro. However, the judgment would
be converted into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of entry of the judgment.
Consequently, in a lawsuit for payment on the Notes, investors would bear currency exchange risk until a
New York state court judgment is entered, which could be a long time from the date the judgment is
rendered. In courts outside of New York, investors may not be able to obtain a judgment in a currency
other than U.S. dollars. For example, a judgment for money in an action based on the Notes in many other
U.S. federal or state courts ordinarily would be enforced in the United States only in U.S. dollars. The
date used to determine the rate of conversion of euro into U.S. dollars will depend upon various factors,
including which court renders the judgment.

**_The Notes permit us to make payments in U.S. dollars if we are unable to obtain euro._**

We will pay the principal of and interest on each Note to the registered holder in euro in immediately
available funds, provided that, if on or after the issuance of the Notes, the euro is unavailable to us due to
the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond our control or if the euro is no longer
being used by the then-member states of the European Monetary Union that have adopted the euro as

28


-----

their currency or for the settlement of transactions by public institutions of or within the international
banking community, then all payments in respect of the Notes will be made in U.S. dollars until the euro
is again available to us or so used. In such circumstances, the amount payable on any date in euro will be
converted into U.S. dollars at the rate mandated by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board at the close of
business on the second business day prior to the relevant payment date or, in the event that the U.S.
Federal Reserve Board has not mandated a rate of conversion, on the basis of the then-most recent U.S.
dollar/euro exchange rate available on or prior to the second business day prior to the relevant payment
date as determined by us in our sole discretion. Any payment in respect of the Notes so made in U.S.
dollars will not constitute an event of default under the Notes or the Indenture. See “Description of
Notes—Terms of the Notes.” This exchange rate may be materially less favorable than the rate in effect at
the time the Notes were issued or as would be determined by applicable law. Such developments, or
market perceptions concerning these and related issues, could materially adversely affect the value of the
Notes and you may lose a significant amount of your investment in the Notes.

**_The notes will initially be held in book-entry form and therefore investors must rely on the procedures_**
**_of the relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

The Notes will initially only be issued in global certificated form and held through Euroclear and
Clearstream. Interests in the Global Notes (as such term is defined in “Book-Entry, Settlement and
Clearance”) will trade in book-entry form only. Unless and until the Notes in definitive registered form
are issued in exchange for book-entry interests, owners of book-entry interests will not be considered
owners or holders of the Notes. The common depositary (or its nominee) for the accounts of Euroclear
and Clearstream will be the registered holder of the Global Notes. Payments in respect of the Global
Notes representing the Notes (including principal, premium, interest and additional amounts, if any) will
be made to the paying agent. The paying agent will then make such payments to the common depositary
(or its nominee) for Euroclear and Clearstream. The common depositary (or its nominee) will in turn
distribute such payments to participants in accordance with its procedures. After payment to the common
depositary (or its nominee), we, the Trustee and the paying agent will have no responsibility or liability
for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly,
if you own a book-entry interest, you must rely on the procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, as
applicable, and if you are not a participant in Euroclear or Clearstream, on the procedures of the
participant through which you own your interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of
notes under the Indenture. See “Book-Entry, Settlement and Clearance.” Payments in respect of the
Global Notes representing the Notes (including principal, premium, interest and additional amounts, if
any) will be made to the paying agent one Business Day prior to the date such payment is due.

Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the
direct right to act upon our solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of
the Notes. Instead, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be permitted to act only to the extent you
have received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear or Clearstream or, if applicable, a participant.
There can be no assurance that procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies will be sufficient
to enable you to vote on any request actions on a timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture, unless and until notes
in definitive registered form are issued in respect of all book entry interests, if you own a book entry
interest, you will be restricted to acting through Euroclear or Clearstream. We, the Trustee and the paying
agent cannot assure you that the procedures to be implemented through Euroclear or Clearstream will be
adequate to ensure the timely exercise of rights under the Notes. See “Book-Entry, Settlement and
Clearance.”

**Risks Relating to the Collateral**

**_Even though the holders of the Notes will benefit from a lien on the Collateral that secures our_**
**_Existing Credit Facilities and the Existing Secured Notes, the representative of the lenders under our_**
**_Existing Credit Agreement initially controls actions with respect to the Collateral. If required to do so_**
**_pursuant to applicable law, the Collateral Agent may release the Collateral securing the Notes_**
**_automatically, without your consent or the consent of the Trustee._**

On the closing date of this offering, the Notes will be secured by liens on the same Collateral that
secures our obligations under the Existing Credit Facilities and the Existing Secured Notes. Under the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, however, the ability to cause the commencement of enforcement
proceedings against such Collateral and to control such proceedings and certain decisions in a bankruptcy
proceeding will be at the direction of the authorized representative of the lenders under the Existing
Credit Agreement governing our Existing Credit Facilities until the expiration of a standstill period.

In addition, subject to certain limitations, the Existing Credit Agreement and the Existing Secured
Indentures permit, and the Indenture governing the Notes will permit, us to issue up to a certain amount of
additional debt that also has a first-priority lien on the same Collateral. At any time that the representative
of the lenders under our Existing Credit Agreement does not have the right to take actions with respect to
the Collateral pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, that right passes to the authorized representative of
the holders of the next largest outstanding principal amount of indebtedness secured by a first-priority lien
on the Collateral. The authorized representative for such indebtedness would be next in line to exercise
rights under the Intercreditor Agreement, rather than the authorized representative for the Notes. Our
Existing Credit Facilities will be the largest portion, followed by the Existing Secured Notes, as of the
issue date.

Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the authorized representative of the holders of the Notes may
not object following the filing of a bankruptcy petition to any debtor-in-possession financing or to the use
of any cash collateral to secure that financing, in each case that has been consented to by the
representative of the lenders under the Existing Credit Agreement governing the Existing Credit Facilities
or the applicable authorized representative, subject to conditions and limited exceptions. After such a
filing, the value of this Collateral could materially deteriorate, and the holders of the Notes would be
unable to raise an objection.

In addition, under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Collateral Agent may be required to release or
subordinate liens pursuant to applicable law under a final and nonappealable order or judgment of a court
of competent jurisdiction, without your consent or the consent of the Trustee.

**_It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral._**

No appraisal of the value of the Collateral securing the Notes has been made in connection with
this offering and the fair market value of the Collateral is subject to fluctuations based on factors that
include, among others, market and other economic conditions, including the availability of suitable
buyers. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable
market value. We cannot assure you that the fair market value of the Collateral as of the date of this
offering memorandum exceeds, or at any other point in time will exceed, the principal amount of the debt
secured thereby. The value of the Collateral and the guarantees could be impaired in the future as a result
of changing economic conditions, our failure to implement our business strategy, competition, liabilities
and other future events. Accordingly, there may not be sufficient Collateral to pay all or any of the
amounts due on the Notes or the other debt secured by first-priority liens on the Collateral, including the
obligations under our Existing Credit Agreement and the Existing Secured Notes. Any claim for the
difference between the amount, if any, realized by holders of the Notes and the other holders of first
30


-----

priority liens on the Collateral from the sale of the Collateral and the obligations of the Issuers and
Guarantors under the Notes will be equal in right of payment with all of our other unsecured
unsubordinated indebtedness and other obligations, including trade payables. Additionally, in the event
that a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding is commenced by or against us, if the value of the Collateral is
less than the amount of principal and accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes and all other pari passu
senior secured obligations, interest may cease to accrue on the Notes from and after the date such
proceedings are commenced or initiated. Also, any disposition of the Collateral during a bankruptcy or
insolvency proceeding outside of the ordinary course of our business would require approval from the
bankruptcy court (which may not be given under certain circumstances).

To the extent that third parties enjoy prior liens on any of the Collateral or are able to attach liens
to any of the Collateral, such third parties may have rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral
that, if exercised, could adversely affect the value of the Collateral. Additionally, the terms of the
Indenture will allow us to (i) issue additional secured indebtedness, including additional debt that may be
_pari passu in the Collateral with the Notes, and (ii) incur refinancing indebtedness in certain_
circumstances. The Indenture will not require that we maintain the current level of Collateral value or
maintain a specific ratio of indebtedness to asset values. Under the Indenture, any such additional secured
indebtedness may be pari passu in the Collateral with the Notes and be entitled to the same rights and
priority with respect to the Collateral. Thus, the issuance of any such additional debt and refinancing
indebtedness may have the effect of significantly diluting your ability to recover payment in full of the
Notes from the then-existing pool of Collateral. Releases of Collateral from the liens securing the Notes
will be permitted under certain circumstances. See “Description of Notes—Security—Release of Liens.”

In the future, the obligation to grant additional security over assets, or a particular type or class of
assets, whether as a result of the acquisition or creation of future assets or subsidiaries, the designation of
a previously unrestricted subsidiary or otherwise, will be subject to the provisions of the Indenture
governing the Notes and the Security Documents (as defined below), including the Intercreditor
Agreement. Furthermore, upon enforcement against any Collateral or during a bankruptcy or insolvency
proceeding, under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the claims of the holders of the Notes to the
proceeds thereof will rank equally with the claims of the holders of obligations under the Existing Credit
Agreement, the Existing Secured Notes and any other indebtedness that is secured on a first-priority basis
by the Collateral. The security interest of the Collateral Agent on behalf of the holders of the Notes is
subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests in collateral.
For example, the consent of a third party may be necessary to obtain or enforce a security interest in a
contract and such consent may not be provided. Also, the consents of any third parties may not
necessarily be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure or realization on the Collateral. Accordingly,
the Collateral Agent may not have the ability to foreclose or realize upon those assets and the value of the
Collateral may significantly decrease.

**_Holders of the Notes may not be able to fully realize the value of their liens._**

The security interests and liens for the benefit of holders of the Notes may be released without
such holders’ consent in specified circumstances. In particular, the Security Documents generally provide
for an automatic release of all liens on any asset securing the Notes, the Existing Secured Notes or our
Existing Credit Facilities on a first-priority basis that is disposed of in compliance with the provisions of
the Existing Credit Agreement governing our Existing Credit Facilities, the Existing Secured Indentures
and the Indenture governing the Notes. As a result, we cannot assure holders of the Notes that the Notes
will continue to be secured by a substantial portion of our assets.

Moreover, the Collateral Agent may need to evaluate the impact of potential liabilities before
determining to foreclose on Collateral consisting of real property because secured creditors that hold a
security interest in real property may be held liable under environmental laws for the costs of remediating

31


-----

or preventing the release or threatened release of hazardous substances at such real property.
Consequently, the Collateral Agent may decline to foreclose on such Collateral or exercise remedies
available in respect thereof if it does not receive indemnification to its satisfaction from the holders of the
Notes.

In addition, all or a portion of the Collateral may be released:

    - to enable the sale, transfer or other disposal of such Collateral in a transaction not prohibited
under the Indenture governing the Notes, the Existing Secured Indentures or the Existing
Credit Agreement governing our Existing Credit Facilities, including the sale of assets in
accordance with the asset sale covenant in the Indenture that governs the Notes and the sale
of any entity in its entirety that owns or holds such Collateral;

    - with respect to Collateral held by a Guarantor, upon the release of such Guarantor from its
guarantee; and

    - with respect to Collateral held by a Co-Issuer, upon the release of such Co-Issuer from its
obligations under the Indenture.

Furthermore, the guarantee of each Guarantor will be suspended, and the liens on each such
Guarantor’s collateral and the collateral of the Issuers will be terminated for so long as the Notes have
investment grade ratings from at least two of Moody’s, S&P and Fitch and no default has occurred and is
continuing. See “Description of Notes—Covenant Suspension When Notes Obtain Investment Grade
Rating.”

In addition, the guarantee of a Guarantor and the obligations of a Co-Issuer under the Indenture
will be released in connection with a transfer of such Guarantor or Co-Issuer, as applicable, in a
transaction not prohibited by the Indenture governing the Notes or upon certain other events. See
“Description of Notes—Certain Covenants—Asset Sales,” “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants—
Consolidation, Merger and Conveyance, Transfer and Lease of Assets” and “Description of Notes—
Security—Release of Liens.”

The Indenture governing the Notes will permit us to designate one or more of our restricted
subsidiaries as an unrestricted subsidiary. If we designate a Guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary, all of
the liens on any Collateral owned by such Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries and any guarantees of the
Notes by such Guarantor or any subsidiary of such Guarantor will be released under the Indenture
governing the Notes. Designation of a subsidiary as unrestricted will reduce the aggregate value of the
Collateral to the extent that liens on the assets of the unrestricted subsidiary and its subsidiaries are
released. In addition, the creditors of the unrestricted subsidiary and its subsidiaries will have a senior
claim on the assets of such unrestricted subsidiary and its subsidiaries.

**_The Collateral may not be valuable enough to satisfy all of the obligations secured by such Collateral._**

The Notes, the Existing Secured Notes and our Existing Credit Facilities are secured on a firstpriority lien basis (subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens) by substantially all the assets of the
Issuers and any existing and future Guarantors, including all of the capital stock of the Company and each
restricted subsidiary, but excluding all of the assets of our non-guarantor subsidiaries. The actual value of
the Collateral at any time will depend upon market and other economic conditions.

In addition, the asset sale covenant and the definition of asset sale in the Indenture governing the
Notes will have a number of significant exceptions pursuant to which we will be able to sell Collateral

32


-----

securing the Notes without being required to reinvest the proceeds of such sale into assets that will
comprise Collateral or to make an offer to the holders of the Notes to repurchase the Notes.

The value of the pledged assets in the event of a liquidation will depend upon market and
economic conditions, the availability of buyers and similar factors. No independent appraisals of any of
the pledged property have been prepared by or on behalf of us in connection with the offering of the
Notes. Accordingly, we cannot assure holders of the Notes that the proceeds of any sale of the pledged
assets following an acceleration to maturity with respect to the Notes would be sufficient to satisfy, or
would not be substantially less than, amounts due on the Notes and the other debt secured thereby. If the
proceeds of any sale of the pledged assets were not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes, the
holders of the Notes (to the extent their Notes were not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the pledged
assets) would have only an unsecured claim against our remaining assets. By their nature, some or all of
the pledged assets may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Likewise, we
cannot assure holders of the Notes that the pledged assets will be saleable or, if saleable, that there will
not be substantial delays in their liquidation. To the extent that liens, rights and easements granted to third
parties encumber assets located on property owned by us or constitute subordinate liens on the pledged
assets, those third parties may have or may exercise rights and remedies with respect to the property
subject to such encumbrances (including rights to require marshalling of assets) that could adversely
affect the value of the pledged assets located at that site and the ability of the Collateral Agent to realize
or foreclose on the pledged assets at that site.

Moreover, the Indenture governing the Notes will permit us to issue additional secured debt,
including debt secured equally and ratably by the same assets pledged for the benefit of the holders of the
Notes, subject to certain limitations. This could reduce amounts payable to holders of the Notes from the
proceeds of any sale of the Collateral.

**_The Collateral will be subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other_**
**_imperfections that may exist in respect of the security interests required with respect to the Existing_**
**_Credit Agreement and the Existing Secured Notes._**

The Collateral will be subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other
imperfections that may exist in respect of the security interests required with respect to the Existing Credit
Agreement. In addition, there will be no requirement to make any foreign security filings outside the
United States in respect of the Collateral. The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances,
liens and other imperfections or lack of filings could adversely affect the value of the Collateral as well as
the ability of the Collateral Agent to realize or foreclose on the Collateral for the benefit of the holders of
the Notes. The initial purchasers have neither analyzed the effect of, nor participated in any negotiations
relating to, such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and imperfections, including the lack of any
such filing in foreign jurisdictions outside the United States, and the existence thereof could adversely
affect the value of the Collateral as well as the ability of the Collateral Agent to realize or foreclose on the
Collateral for the benefit of the holders of the Notes.

**_Rights of the holders of the Notes in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect_**
**_liens on certain Collateral acquired in the future._**

Applicable law requires that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general
security interest, such as real property, equipment subject to a certificate and certain proceeds, can only be
perfected at the time such property and rights are acquired and identified. Furthermore, in certain
jurisdictions, “blanket” or “floating” liens will not be available to secure any Collateral. Neither the
Collateral Agent nor the Trustee will monitor, and we may not inform the Collateral Agent or the Trustee
of, the future acquisitions of property and rights that constitute Collateral, and necessary action may not
be taken to properly perfect the security interest in such after-acquired Collateral. Neither the Collateral

33


-----

Agent nor the Trustee has any obligation to monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights that
constitute Collateral or the perfection of any security interest in favor of the Notes against third parties.
As a result, the inability or failure of the Issuers or any Guarantor to promptly take all actions necessary to
create properly perfected security interests in the Collateral may result in the loss of the priority, or a
defect in the perfection, of the security interest for the benefit of the holders of the Notes to which they
would have been otherwise entitled. In addition, as described further herein, even if the liens on Collateral
acquired in the future are properly perfected, such liens may potentially be avoidable as a preference in
any bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding under certain circumstances. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating
to This Offering and the Notes—Federal and state statutes allow courts, under specific circumstances, to
avoid the Notes and the guarantees, to require holders of the Notes to return payments received from the
Issuers or the Guarantors, and to take other actions detrimental to the holders of the Notes.”

**_The Collateral is subject to casualty risks._**

Although we maintain insurance policies to insure against losses, there are certain losses that may
be either uninsurable or not economically insurable, in whole or in part. As a result, it is possible that the
insurance proceeds will not compensate us fully for our losses in the event of a catastrophic loss. If there
is a total or partial loss of any of the Collateral, we cannot assure you that any insurance proceeds
received by us will be sufficient to satisfy all the secured obligations, including the Notes.

**_We will, in most cases, have control over the Collateral, and the sale of particular assets by us could_**
**_reduce the pool of assets securing the Notes and any future guarantees. In addition, certain assets,_**
**_including Excluded Assets, will be excluded from the Collateral and certain other liens will be_**
**_permitted to exist on our assets, including the Collateral._**

The terms of the Security Documents, the Existing Credit Agreement and the Existing Secured
Indentures allow, and the Indenture governing the Notes offered hereby will allow, us to remain in
possession of, retain exclusive control over, freely operate, and collect, invest and dispose of any income
from, the Collateral. For example, in accordance with the Security Documents, the Existing Credit
Agreement, the Existing Secured Indentures and the Indenture, we may, among other things, without
approval or consent of the Collateral Agent or the Trustee, conduct activities with respect to Collateral,
such as selling, factoring, abandoning or otherwise disposing of Collateral and making cash payments
(including repayments of indebtedness). The lien on any Collateral will be automatically released upon
any permitted disposition thereof to a person that is not an Issuer or a Guarantor and, in such event, will
no longer secure the obligations under the Indenture. See “Description of Notes—Security—Release of
Liens.”

In addition, certain assets of the Issuers and the Guarantors, including Excluded Assets, will be
excluded from the Collateral, and other liens will be permitted to exist on our assets, including the
Collateral, in each case as provided in the Indenture and the Security Documents. See “Description of
Notes—Security.”

**_To the extent lien searches are performed, such searches may not reveal all existing liens on the_**
**_Collateral._**

We cannot guarantee that any lien searches conducted on the Collateral will reveal all existing
liens on the Collateral. Any existing undiscovered lien could be significant, could be prior in ranking to
the liens securing the Notes or the guarantees and could have an adverse effect on the ability of the
Collateral Agent to realize or foreclose upon the Collateral. In addition, certain statutory priority liens
may also exist that cannot be discovered by lien searches.

**_Rights of the holders of the Notes in the Collateral may be adversely affected by bankruptcy and_**
**_insolvency proceedings and the holders of the Notes may not be entitled to post-petition interest, fees,_**
**_or expenses in any bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding._**

The right of the Collateral Agent to repossess and dispose of the Collateral is likely to be
significantly impaired, and at a minimum delayed, if U.S. bankruptcy proceedings are commenced by or
against any of the Issuers prior to or possibly even after the Collateral Agent has repossessed and
disposed of the Collateral. Under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, pursuant to the automatic stay imposed upon
a bankruptcy filing, secured creditors, such as the Collateral Agent, are prohibited from repossessing its
security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from disposing of security repossessed from a debtor,
without prior bankruptcy court approval (which may not be given under the circumstances). Moreover,
U.S. bankruptcy law permits the debtor to continue to retain and to use collateral, and the proceeds,
products, rents or profits of collateral, even though the debtor is in default under the applicable debt
instruments, provided that the secured creditor is given “adequate protection.” The meaning of the term
“adequate protection” may vary according to circumstances, but it is intended in general to protect the
value of the secured creditor’s interest in Collateral and may include cash payments or the granting of
additional or replacement security, if and at such time as the court in its discretion determines, for any
diminution in the value of Collateral as a result of the stay of repossession or disposition or any use of
collateral by the debtor during the pendency of the bankruptcy case. A bankruptcy court may determine
that a secured creditor does not require compensation for diminution in the value of its collateral if the
value of such collateral exceeds the debt it secures. In view of the lack of a precise definition of the term
“adequate protection” and the broad discretionary powers of a U.S. bankruptcy court, it is impossible to
predict whether or when payments under the Notes could be delayed following the commencement of a
bankruptcy case (or the length of the delay in making any such payments), whether or when the Collateral
Agent would repossess or dispose of the Collateral, or whether or to what extent the holders of the Notes
would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the Collateral through the
requirements of “adequate protection.”

Furthermore, in the event a U.S. bankruptcy court determines that the value of the Collateral is
not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes, the Existing Secured Notes, the Existing Credit
Agreement and any additional obligations of the Issuers or any guarantor secured by the Collateral on a
first-priority basis, the holders of the Notes would have “undersecured claims” as to the difference.
Generally, U.S. bankruptcy laws do not permit the payment or accrual of post-petition interest, costs,
expenses and attorneys’ fees for “undersecured claims” during the debtor’s bankruptcy case. Other
consequences of a finding of under-collateralization would include, among other things, a lack of
entitlement to receive “adequate protection” under U.S. bankruptcy laws with respect to any unsecured
portion of the Notes. In addition, if any payments of post-petition interest had been made at the time of
such a finding of under-collateralization, those payments could be recharacterized by a U.S. bankruptcy
court as a reduction of the principal amount of the Notes.

The rights of the Collateral Agent with respect to the Collateral may also be impaired, delayed or
otherwise affected by the insolvency laws of the other jurisdictions in which the Issuers and the
Guarantors are incorporated or organized.

**_In the event of a bankruptcy of any of the Issuers or the Guarantors, holders of the Notes may be_**
**_deemed to have an unsecured claim to the extent that the Issuers’ obligations in respect of the Notes_**
**_exceed the fair market value of the Collateral securing the Notes._**

In any bankruptcy proceeding with respect to any of the Issuers or the Guarantors, it is possible
that the bankruptcy trustee, the debtor-in-possession or competing creditors will assert that the fair market
value of the Collateral with respect to the Notes on the date of the bankruptcy filing was less than the
then-current principal amount of the Notes. Upon a finding by the bankruptcy court that the Notes are

35


-----

under-collateralized, the claims in the bankruptcy proceeding with respect to the Notes would be
bifurcated between a secured claim and an unsecured claim, and the unsecured claim would not be
entitled to the benefits of security in the Collateral. Other consequences of a finding of undercollateralization would be, among other things, a lack of entitlement on the part of the Notes to receive
post-petition interest and a lack of entitlement on the part of the unsecured portion of the Notes to receive
other “adequate protection” under federal bankruptcy laws. In addition, if any payments of post-petition
interest had been made at the time of such a finding of under-collateralization, those payments could be
recharacterized by the bankruptcy court as a reduction of the principal amount of the secured claim with
respect to the Notes.

**Use of Proceeds**

We expect to receive net proceeds of approximately €493.8 million from the sale of the Notes,
after deducting the initial purchasers’ discount and other offering expenses payable by us. We intend to

Credit Facility, without a reduction in commitment. We will use cash on hand to pay the offering
expenses payable by us in connection with this offering.

Certain of the initial purchasers or their respective affiliates act as agents and/or lenders under our
Existing Credit Facilities and therefore may receive a portion of the proceeds of this offering. See

**Description of Other Indebtedness**

_The following section summarizes the terms of our principal indebtedness. It does not purport to_
_be complete and is subject to, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, the underlying documents._

**The Existing Credit Agreement**

On April 5, 2018, the Company entered into a new credit agreement (including subsequent
amendments described below, if applicable, the “Existing Credit Agreement”), which amended and
restated its prior credit agreement. The Existing Credit Agreement provided for (a) the incurrence by the
Company of (1) a senior secured term A facility in an aggregate principal amount of (i) $1,000.0 million
denominated in U.S. dollars and (ii) €2,035.0 million denominated in euros and (2) a senior secured term
B facility in an aggregate principal amount of (i) $1,400.0 million denominated in U.S. dollars and (ii)
€850.0 million denominated in euros; and (b) the incurrence by the Company and Coty B.V., a Dutch
subsidiary of the Company (the “Dutch Borrower”), of a senior secured revolving credit facility in an
aggregate principal amount of $3,250.0 million denominated in U.S. dollars, specified alternative
currencies or other currencies freely convertible into U.S. dollars and readily available in the London
interbank market. The Existing Credit Agreement was modified by each of the 2019 Amendment, the
2020 Amendment, the June 2021 Amendment, the November 2021 Amendment, the SOFR Amendment
and the 2023 Amendment described below.

The Existing Credit Agreement provided that with respect to the 2018 Coty revolving credit
facility due April 2023, up to $150.0 million is available for letters of credit and up to $150.0 million was
available for swingline loans. The Existing Credit Agreement also permitted, subject to certain terms and
conditions, the incurrence of incremental facilities thereunder in an aggregate amount of (i) $1,700.0
million plus (ii) an unlimited amount if the First Lien Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Existing
Credit Agreement), at the time of incurrence of such incremental facilities and after giving effect thereto
on a pro forma basis, is less than or equal to 3.00 to 1.00.

The obligations of the Company under the Existing Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the
Guarantors and the obligations of the Company and the Guarantors under the Existing Credit Agreement
are secured by a perfected first-priority lien on substantially all of the assets of the Company and the
Guarantors, subject to certain exceptions. The Dutch Borrower does not guarantee the obligations of the
Company under the Existing Credit Agreement or grant any liens on its assets to secure any obligations
under the Existing Credit Agreement.

On June 27, 2019, the Company entered into an amendment (the “2019 Amendment”) to the
Existing Credit Agreement. The 2019 Amendment modified the Existing Credit Agreement by (x)
amending the financial covenant to (i) delay until the test period ending March 31, 2022 the “Total Net
Leverage Ratio” step down from 5.25 to 5.00, (ii) extend the applicable window for certain cost savings
add-backs in the calculation of “Adjusted EBITDA” for purposes of determining the “Total Net Leverage
Ratio” and (iii) amend the determination of the exchange rate to be used in the calculation of “Total
Indebtedness” for purposes of determining the “Total Net Leverage Ratio” and (y) decreasing the total
commitments under the 2018 Coty revolving credit facility due April 2023 by $500.0 million to $2,750.0
million.

On April 29, 2020, the Company entered into an additional amendment (the “2020 Amendment”)
to further modify the Existing Credit Agreement by, among other things, (i) providing a financial
covenant “holiday” through the test period ended March 31, 2021, (ii) establishing a minimum liquidity
covenant through March 31, 2021 of $350.0 million, which increased to $500.0 million as a result of the
prepayment event related to the sale of Wella, and (iii) placing limitations on our ability to make certain
investments and restricted payments (including our ability to pay dividends in cash) and to incur
additional secured indebtedness, in each case through March 31, 2021. The 2020 Amendment did not

40


-----

modify the applicable funding costs during the period through March 31, 2021. The limitations on the
Company’s activities imposed by the 2020 Amendment and the financial covenant “holiday” are no
longer applicable.

On June 4, 2021, the Company entered into an additional amendment (the “June 2021
Amendment”) to the Existing Credit Agreement. The June 2021 Amendment, among other things, created
a new class of revolving commitments in an aggregate principal amount of $700.0 million, which
commitments would have matured in April 2025. Such new class of commitments became effective on
September 30, 2021, following the reduction of the commitments under the 2018 Coty revolving credit
facility due April 2023 in an aggregate principal amount equal to $700.0 million.

On November 30, 2021, the Company entered into an additional amendment (the “November
2021 Amendment”) to the Existing Credit Agreement, which established a senior secured revolving credit
facility of $2.0 billion maturing in April 2025 to refinance and replace the Company’s revolving credit
facilities existing at such time. The November 2021 Amendment also includes a waiver from the
participating banks in respect of the requirement to utilize or repay outstanding term loans with net
proceeds from the sale of the Wella Business.

On March 7, 2023, the Company entered into an additional amendment (the “SOFR
Amendment”) to the Existing Credit Agreement to effectuate a customary transition of the underlying
variable interest rate from LIBOR to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”).

Effective as of July 14, 2023, the Company entered into an additional amendment (the “2023
Amendment”) to the Existing Credit Agreement. The 2023 Amendment replaced the Company’s existing
revolving commitments, having an aggregate principal amount of $2.0 billion, with two classes of
revolving commitments, having an aggregate principal amount of $1,670.0 million available in dollars
and other currencies and €300.0 million available in euros. The resulting classes of revolving
commitments have substantially the same terms as the previously existing revolving commitments, except
that (i) the new revolving credit facility will mature in July 2028, (ii) revolving loans made pursuant
thereto that bear interest at the adjusted term SOFR rate will have a credit spread adjustment of 0.10% for
all interest periods, (iii) in addition to S&P and Moody’s, Fitch will be a relevant rating agency for
purposes of the collateral release provisions (which provisions will apply for so long as, subject to the
satisfaction of certain other conditions, the Company’s applicable credit rating is an investment grade
rating from no less than two of such rating agencies) and the interest rates and fees applicable to the new
revolving credit facility and (iv) certain covenants will cease to apply during a collateral release period.

**Existing Unsecured Notes**

On April 5, 2018, the Company issued, at par, $550.0 million of 6.50% senior unsecured notes
due 2026 (the “2026 Dollar Notes”), €550.0 million of 4.00% senior unsecured notes due 2023 (the “2023
Euro Notes”) and €250.0 million of 4.75% senior unsecured notes due 2026 (the “2026 Euro Notes”) in a
private offering.

The Existing Unsecured Notes are senior unsecured debt obligations of the Company and are pari
_passu in right of payment with all of the Company’s existing and future senior indebtedness (including_
the Existing Credit Facilities, the Existing Secured Notes and the Notes offered hereby). The Existing
Unsecured Notes are guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior basis by the Guarantors. The Existing
Unsecured Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and are effectively junior to all
existing and future indebtedness of the Company to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such
secured indebtedness. The related guarantees are senior unsecured obligations of each Guarantor and are
effectively junior to all existing and future secured indebtedness of such Guarantor to the extent of the
value of the collateral securing such indebtedness. The 2026 Dollar Notes and the 2026 Euro Notes
mature on April 15, 2026. Interest on the 2026 Dollar Notes and the 2026 Euro Notes is payable semi
41


-----

annually in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year. The Company redeemed all of the
outstanding 2023 Euro Notes on April 15, 2022. On December 7, 2022, the Company redeemed $77.0
million of the 2026 Dollar Notes and €69.7 million (approximately $72.2 million) of the 2026 Euro
Notes, leaving $473.0 million and €180.3 million (approximately $196.0 million) of the 2026 Dollar
Notes and the 2026 Euro Notes outstanding, respectively. Upon the occurrence of certain change of
control triggering events with respect to a series of Existing Unsecured Notes, the Company will be
required to offer to repurchase all or part of the Existing Unsecured Notes of such series at 101% of their
principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the purchase date applicable
to such Existing Unsecured Notes. The existing unsecured indenture contains customary covenants that
place restrictions in certain circumstances on, among other things, incurrence of liens, entry into sale or
leaseback transactions, sale of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets and certain merger or
consolidation transactions. The existing unsecured indenture also provides for customary events of
default.

**Existing Secured Notes**

On April 21, 2021, the Company issued, at par, $900.0 million of 5.000% Senior Secured Notes
(the “2026 Dollar Senior Secured Notes”) in a private offering. On June 16, 2021, the Company issued, at
par, an aggregate principal amount of €700.0 million of 3.875% Senior Secured Notes (the “2026 Euro
Senior Secured Notes”) in a private offering. On November 30, 2021, the Issuers issued, at par, an
aggregate principal amount of $500.0 million of 4.750% Senior Secured Notes (the “2029 Dollar Senior
Secured Notes”) in a private offering. On July 26, 2023, the Issuers issued, at par, an aggregate principal
amount of $750.0 million of 6.625% Senior Secured Notes (the “2030 Dollar Senior Secured Notes”) in a
private offering.

The Existing Secured Notes are senior secured obligations of the Company and are guaranteed on
a senior secured basis by each of the Company’s wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries that guarantees the
Company’s obligations under the Existing Credit Facilities and are secured by first-priority liens on the
same collateral that secures the Company’s obligations under the Existing Credit Facilities. The Existing
Secured Notes and the guarantees are equal in right of payment with all of the Company’s and its
guarantors’ respective existing and future senior indebtedness (including the Existing Unsecured Notes,
the Existing Credit Facilities and the Notes offered hereby) and are pari passu with all of the Company’s
and its guarantors’ respective existing and future indebtedness that is secured by a first-priority lien on the
collateral (including the Existing Credit Facilities, the Existing Secured Notes and the Notes offered
hereby) to the extent of the value of such collateral.

The 2030 Dollar Senior Secured Notes are redeemable at the option of the Company, in whole or
in part, at any time on or prior to July 15, 2026 at 100% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus a
“make-whole” premium and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.
The 2029 Dollar Senior Secured Notes are redeemable at the option of the Company, in whole or in part,
at any time on or prior to January 15, 2025 at 100% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus a
“make-whole” premium and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.
The redemption prices for the 2026 Euro Senior Secured Notes and 2026 Dollar Senior Secured Notes
are, and the redemption price for the 2029 Dollar Senior Secured Notes after January 15, 2025 and the
2030 Dollar Senior Secured Notes after July 15, 2026 will be, equal to the redemption prices set forth in
the Existing Secured Indentures, together with any accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. In
addition, the Company may redeem up to 40% of the 2029 Dollar Senior Secured Notes and the 2030
Dollar Senior Secured Notes using the proceeds of certain equity offerings completed before January 15,
2025 and July 15, 2026, respectively. Upon the occurrence of certain change of control triggering events
with respect to the Existing Secured Notes, the Company will be required to offer to repurchase such
Existing Secured Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued
and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the purchase date applicable to such Existing Secured Notes.

42


-----

The Existing Secured Indentures contain covenants that limit the ability of the Company and any
of its restricted subsidiaries to, among other things:

    - sell, transfer or otherwise convey any assets;

    - incur additional indebtedness, guarantee indebtedness or issue disqualified stock or, in the
case of such subsidiaries, preferred stock;

    - pay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect of their capital stock or make
other restricted payments;

    - make certain investments or acquisitions;

    - sell, transfer or otherwise convey certain assets;

    - create liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions;

    - enter into agreements restricting certain subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends or make other
intercompany transfers;

    - consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Company and its restricted subsidiaries;

    - enter into certain transactions with affiliates; and

    - prepay certain kinds of indebtedness.

The Existing Secured Indentures also provide for customary events of default.

**Description of Notes**

_The terms of the Notes (as defined below) will include those set forth in the Indenture (as defined_
_below). You should carefully read the summary below and the provisions of the Indenture that may be_
_important to you before investing in the Notes. This summary is not complete and is qualified in its_
_entirety by reference to the Indenture, the Notes and the Security Documents. We urge you to read the_
_Indenture, the Notes and the Security Documents because they, not this description, define your rights as_
_holders of the Notes._

Certain terms used in this description are defined under the subheading “—Certain Definitions.”
In this description, references to “Coty,” “us,” “we,” “our” or the “Company” refer only to Coty Inc. and
not to any of its Subsidiaries, the “Co-Issuers” refer to HFC Prestige Products, Inc. and HFC Prestige
International U.S. LLC, and the “Issuers” refer, collectively, to the Company and the Co-Issuers.

**General**

The Issuers will issue €500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of      % Senior Secured
Notes due 2028 (the “Notes”) under an indenture (the “Indenture”), to be entered into by and among the
Issuers, the Guarantors, Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee (the “Trustee”), the
Collateral Agent (as defined below) and Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as paying agent. The
registered holder of a Note will be treated as its owner for all purposes. Only registered holders will have
rights under the Indenture.

Unless previously redeemed or repurchased and cancelled, the Issuers will repay the Notes in
cash at 100% of their principal amount together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon at maturity.

The Notes will be the joint and several senior secured debt obligations of the Issuers and will be
_pari passu in right of payment with all of the Issuers’ other existing and future senior Indebtedness._

The Notes will be entitled to the benefits of the Note Guarantees described under “—
Guarantees.”

The Notes will be redeemable by the Issuers at any time prior to maturity at the redemption prices
and in the manner described below under “—Optional Redemption.” Not later than 30 days following a
Change of Control Triggering Event with respect to the Notes, the Issuers will be required to make an
offer to repurchase the Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes on the date of
repurchase plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the Change of Control Payment
Date.

The Issuers may from time to time, without notice to or the consent of the holders or beneficial
owners of the Notes, but subject to compliance with the covenants described below, create and issue
additional Notes (“Additional Notes”) of the same series as the Notes offered hereby, having the same
terms (except for the Issue Date and, in some cases, the initial issue price and the first interest payment
date) and be equal with the Notes in all respects (or in all respects other than the payment of interest
accruing prior to the Issue Date of such Additional Notes except for the first payment of interest
following the Issue Date of such Additional Notes); provided that if such Additional Notes are not
fungible with the Notes offered hereby for U.S. federal income tax purposes, then such Additional Notes
will have a separate CUSIP number. Such Additional Notes will be consolidated and form a single series
with the Notes offered hereby and be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture,
including, without limitation, waivers, consents, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase. Unless
expressly stated or the context otherwise requires, references in this “Description of Notes” to the “Notes”

44


-----

include any Additional Notes issued under the Indenture that are treated as a single class with the Notes
described herein.

The Notes will not be subject to a sinking fund. The Notes, the Indenture and the Note
Guarantees will be subject to defeasance as described under “—Defeasance” and the Indenture will be
subject to satisfaction and discharge as described under “—Satisfaction and Discharge.”

If the scheduled maturity date or interest payment date for the Notes falls on a day that is not a
Business Day, the payment of interest and principal will be made on the next succeeding Business Day as
if made on the date such payment was due, and no interest on such payment shall accrue for the period
from and after the scheduled maturity date or interest payment date, as the case may be, on account of
such delay.

Interest on the Notes will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.

The Notes will not be entitled to any registration rights, and the Issuers do not intend to register
the Notes for resale or to offer to exchange the Notes for registered Notes under the U.S. federal or state
securities laws or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction.

**_Terms of the Notes_**

The Notes will mature on       , 2028.

Initial holders of the Notes will be required to pay for the Notes in U.S. dollars, and the Issuers
will pay principal of, premium, if any, and interest, including payments made upon any redemption or
offer to purchase, on the Notes in euro. If, on or after the issuance of the Notes, the euro is unavailable to
the Company due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond its control or if
the euro is no longer being used by the then member states of the EMU that have adopted the euro as their
currency or for the settlement of transactions by public institutions of or within the international banking
community, then all payments in respect of the Notes will be made in U.S. dollars until the euro is again
available to the Company or so used. In such circumstances, the amount payable on any date in euro will
be converted into U.S. dollars at the rate mandated by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board as of the close of
business on the second Business Day prior to the relevant payment date or, in the event the U.S. Federal
Reserve Board has not mandated a rate of conversion, on the basis of the then most recent U.S.
dollar/euro exchange rate available on or prior to the second Business Day prior to the relevant payment
date as determined by the Company in its sole discretion. Any payment in respect of the Notes so made in
U.S. dollars will not constitute an event of default under the Notes or the Indenture. Neither the Trustee
nor the paying agent shall have any responsibility for any calculation or conversion in connection with the
foregoing. Investors will be subject to foreign exchange risks as to payments of principal and interest,
including payments made upon any redemption of Notes, that may have important economic and tax
consequences to them. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to This Offering and the Notes” in this offering
memorandum. In the circumstances described above, the Company and the Trustee shall be permitted,
without the consent of any other Person, to amend the terms of the Indenture and the Notes to change the
currency in which the obligations of the Company hereunder are payable in a manner consistent with
then-prevailing market practice for similarly situated issuers. See “—Modification and Waiver.”

The Notes will be issued in registered, book-entry form only without interest coupons in
minimum denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

The Notes will bear interest at a rate of        % per annum. Interest on the Notes will accrue
from the Issue Date, or from the most recent interest payment date to which interest has been paid or
provided for, to, but excluding, the relevant interest payment date. The Issuers will jointly and severally

45


-----

make interest payments on the Notes semi-annually in arrears on       and        of each year (each,
an “Interest Payment Date”), beginning on     , 2024, to the Person in whose name such Notes are
registered at the close of business on the immediately preceding       or       (each, a “Record

The Company intends to apply to the Authority for the listing of the Notes on the Official List of
TISE. There can be no assurance that the Notes will be listed on TISE and admitted for trading on the
exchange market. Accordingly, the Company cannot assure you that any active trading market for the
Notes will develop or be maintained. There is currently no market for the Notes. This offering of the
Notes is not contingent upon obtaining this listing.

**Guarantees**

The Company’s Subsidiaries that Guarantee the Credit Agreement (other than the Co-Issuers)
will initially Guarantee the Issuers’ obligations under the Indenture and the Notes.

Each of the Guarantors will jointly and severally Guarantee the Issuers’ obligations under the
Indenture and the Notes on a senior secured basis. The obligations of each Guarantor under its Note
Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent its Note Guarantee from constituting fraudulent
conveyances or fraudulent transfers under applicable law; this limitation, however, may not be effective
to prevent such Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating
to This Offering and the Notes—Federal and state statutes allow courts, under specific circumstances, to
avoid the Notes and the guarantees, to require holders of the Notes to return payments received from the
Issuers or the Guarantors, and to take other actions detrimental to the holders of the Notes.”

Each Guarantor may consolidate with or merge into or sell its assets to any Issuer or another
Guarantor without limitation, or with, into or to any other Persons upon the terms and conditions set forth
in the Indenture. See “—Certain Covenants—Consolidation, Merger and Conveyance, Transfer and Lease
of Assets.”

The Note Guarantee of a Guarantor will be automatically and unconditionally released without
any further action by any Person in the event that:

(a) there is a sale, disposition or other transfer (including through merger or
consolidation) of all of the Capital Stock (or any sale, disposition or other transfer of
Capital Stock (including through merger or consolidation) following which the
applicable Guarantor is no longer a Subsidiary, including by way of a dividend of the
Capital Stock of such Guarantor to the stockholders of the Company), or all or
substantially all the assets, of the applicable Guarantor to a Person that is not a
Subsidiary of the Company where such sale, disposition or other transfer is not
prohibited by the Indenture;

(b) if the Issuers exercise their legal defeasance option or their covenant defeasance
option as described under “—Defeasance” or if their obligations under the Indenture
are discharged in accordance with the terms of the Indenture as described under “—
Satisfaction and Discharge”;

(c) in the case of the Note Guarantees issued on the Issue Date, upon the release or
discharge of the Guarantee by such Guarantor of Indebtedness under the Credit
Agreement, or, in all other cases, the release or discharge of such other Guarantee that
resulted in the creation of such Note Guarantee, except, in each case, a discharge or
release by or as a result of payment under such Guarantee (it being understood that a
release subject to a contingent reinstatement is still a release, and that if any such

46


-----

Guarantee is so reinstated, such Note Guarantee shall also be reinstated to the extent
that such Subsidiary would then be required to provide a Note Guarantee pursuant to
the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees”);
_provided that the Guarantees by such Guarantor of the Existing Notes are also_
released at or prior to such time;

(d) the proper designation of any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor as an
Unrestricted Subsidiary; or

(e) upon the occurrence of the Covenant Suspension Event, as provided under “—
Covenant Suspension When Notes Obtain Investment Grade Rating.”

For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, our Co-Issuers and Guarantors (which include
our wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries) had net revenues of $1,550.4 million and $1,482.9 million,
respectively. In addition, as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, these U.S. subsidiaries had long-lived assets of
$3,559.5 million and $3,972.2 million, respectively. Long-lived assets include property and equipment,
goodwill and other intangible assets. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to This Offering and the Notes—
Not all of our subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes, and your right to receive payment on the Notes will
be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of our non-guarantor subsidiaries.”

At June 30, 2023, on a Pro Forma Basis after giving effect to the Recent Developments
Refinancing Transactions, the offering of the Notes offered hereby and the use of proceeds therefrom
described under “Use of Proceeds:”

(1) the Issuers and the Guarantors would have had outstanding $4.3 billion in aggregate
principal amount of Indebtedness (including the Notes and the Existing Notes), of which
$3.6 billion in aggregate principal amount would have been secured Indebtedness, including
the Notes and the Existing Secured Notes, and approximately $1.8 billion of additional
secured borrowings would have been available and undrawn under the Existing Credit
Facilities (excluding $3.7 million of outstanding letters of credit); and

(2) the Issuers and the Guarantors would have had $0.7 billion in aggregate principal amount of
senior unsecured Indebtedness outstanding, including the Existing Unsecured Notes.

**Security**

**_General_**

The Notes and the Note Guarantees of the Guarantors will be secured by a perfected First-Priority
Lien (subject to Permitted Liens) on all tangible and intangible assets of the Issuers and each Guarantor,
other than Excluded Assets (collectively, the “Collateral”).

The Collateral will be pledged to Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as collateral agent
(together with any successor or assign, the “Collateral Agent”), on a first-priority basis (subject to
Permitted Liens), for the benefit of the Trustee under the Indenture and the holders of the Notes (and the
other secured parties contemplated by the Credit Agreement or the indentures governing the Existing
Secured Notes). The Indenture will permit the Issuers and the Guarantors to create additional Liens under
specified circumstances, including certain additional Liens on the Collateral that may rank equally with
the Liens securing the Notes or, in certain circumstances, senior to such Liens. See the definition of
“Permitted Liens.”

The Collateral will not include (collectively, “Excluded Assets”), in each case so long as not
pledged to secure the Credit Agreement:

(a) (x) any fee-owned real property and (y) any real property leasehold rights and
interests;

(b) motor vehicles, aircraft and other assets subject to certificates of title;

(c) commercial tort claims that, in the reasonable determination of the Company, are not
expected to result in a judgment in excess of $10,000,000;

48


-----

(d) letter of credit rights (other than to the extent consisting of supporting obligations that
can be perfected solely by the filing of a Uniform Commercial Code financing
statement (it being understood that no actions shall be required to perfect a security
interest in letter of credit rights other than filing of a Uniform Commercial Code
financing statement));

(e) any governmental licenses or state or local franchises, charters and authorizations, to
the extent a security interest in any such license, franchise, charter or authorization is
prohibited or restricted thereby (excluding any prohibition or restriction that is
ineffective under the Uniform Commercial Code);

(f) assets to the extent the pledge thereof or grant of security interests therein (x) is
prohibited or restricted by applicable law, rule or regulation, (y) would cause the
destruction, invalidation or abandonment of such asset under applicable law, rule or
regulation or (z) requires any consent, approval, license or other authorization of any
third party or governmental authority (excluding any prohibition or restriction that is
ineffective under the Uniform Commercial Code);

(g) any “Excluded Equity Interest,” which shall be defined to include (i) margin stock, (ii)
Equity Interests of any Person other than the Company or any Wholly Owned
Subsidiary that is a Material Subsidiary and that is a Restricted Subsidiary directly
owned by any Issuer or any Guarantor (other than any Equity Interests in King Kylie,
LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, owned by any Issuer or any Guarantor),
(iii) Equity Interests of any Material Subsidiary that is a Wholly Owned Foreign
Subsidiary or CFC Holdco directly owned by any Issuer or any Guarantor in excess of
65% of such Material Subsidiary’s issued and outstanding Equity Interests, (iv) any
Equity Interest to the extent the pledge thereof would be prohibited by any law or
contractual obligation (excluding any prohibition or restriction that is ineffective
under the Uniform Commercial Code), (v) any Equity Interests with respect to which
the Company and the Collateral Agent have reasonably determined that the cost or
other consequences (including material adverse tax consequences) of pledging or
perfecting a security interest in such Equity Interests are excessive in relation to the
benefit to the secured parties of the security to be afforded thereby; provided that any
such determination made by the Credit Agreement Agent for the comparable
requirement under the Credit Agreement or any related loan document or by the
Existing Secured Notes Collateral Agent under any indenture governing the Existing
Secured Notes or any related collateral document shall be deemed automatically made
by the Collateral Agent under the Indenture and the Security Documents, (vi) the
Equity Interests of any Excluded Subsidiary (other than any Foreign Subsidiary or
CFC Holdco) and (vii) any other Equity Interests that otherwise constitute Excluded
Assets;

(h) Excluded Accounts;

(i) any lease, license or agreement, or any property subject to a purchase money security
interest, capital lease obligation or similar arrangement, in each case to the extent that
a grant of a security interest therein would violate or invalidate such lease, license or
agreement or purchase money or similar arrangement or create a right of termination
in favor of any other party thereto (other than the Company or a Restricted
Subsidiary) or otherwise require consent thereunder (other than from the Company or
a Restricted Subsidiary) after giving effect to the applicable anti-assignment
provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code, other than proceeds and receivables

49


-----

thereof, the assignment of which is expressly deemed effective under the Uniform
Commercial Code notwithstanding such prohibition;

(j) any assets to the extent a security interest in such assets would result in material
adverse tax consequences as reasonably determined by the Company;

(k) any intent-to-use application trademark application prior to the filing, and acceptance
by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, of a “Statement of Use” or “Amendment to
Allege Use” with respect thereto, to the extent, if any, that, and solely during the
period, if any, in which, the grant of a security interest therein would impair the
validity or enforceability of such intent-to-use trademark application under applicable
federal law;

(l) assets where the cost of obtaining a security interest therein is excessive in relation to
the practical benefit to the holders of the Notes afforded thereby as reasonably
determined between the Company and the Collateral Agent; provided that any such
determination made by the Credit Agreement Agent for the comparable requirement
under the Credit Agreement or any related loan document or by the Existing Secured
Notes Collateral Agent under any indenture governing the Existing Secured Notes or
any related collateral document shall be deemed automatically made by the Collateral
Agent under the Indenture and the Security Documents; and

(m) any acquired property (including property acquired through acquisition or merger of

another entity) if at the time of such acquisition the granting of a security interest
therein or the pledge thereof is prohibited by any contract or other agreement (in each
case, not created in contemplation thereof) to the extent and for so long as such
contract or other agreement prohibits such security interest or pledge (excluding any
prohibition or restriction that is ineffective under the Uniform Commercial Code).

The Issuers shall not be required to create or perfect pledges of, or security interests in, or taking
other actions with respect to, any Excluded Assets.

The Collateral Agent shall, at the written direction of the holders, grant extensions of time for the
perfection of security interests in particular assets and the delivery of assets where perfection cannot be
accomplished without undue effort or expense by the time or times at which it would otherwise be
required and any extensions of time or waivers as are granted by the Credit Agreement Agent (as defined
below) or the administrative agent under the Credit Agreement for the comparable requirement under the
Credit Agreement or any related loan document or the Existing Secured Notes Collateral Agent (as
defined below) under any indenture governing the Existing Secured Notes or any related collateral
document shall automatically be granted under the Indenture and the Security Documents.

No actions required by the laws of any non-U.S. jurisdiction shall be required in order to create
any security interests in any assets or to perfect or make enforceable such security interests (including any
intellectual property registered in any non-U.S. jurisdiction) (it being understood that there shall be no
security agreements or pledge agreements governed under the laws of any non-U.S. jurisdiction or any
requirement to make any filings in any foreign jurisdiction including with respect to foreign intellectual
property).

No actions shall be required with respect to assets requiring perfection through control
agreements or perfection by “control” (as defined in the UCC) (other than in respect of Indebtedness for
borrowed money (other than intercompany Indebtedness) owing to the Issuers or any Guarantor that is
evidenced by a note in excess of $7,500,000, Indebtedness of any Non-Guarantor Subsidiary that is owing
to any Issuer or any Guarantor and certificated Equity Interests of wholly owned Restricted Subsidiaries

50


-----

that are Material Subsidiaries otherwise required to be pledged pursuant to the Security Agreement). In
addition, neither any Issuer nor any Guarantor shall be required to take any action not taken for the Credit
Agreement (so long as such Credit Agreement is in place).

**_After-Acquired Property_**

If property (other than Excluded Assets) is acquired by any Issuer or any Guarantor that is not
automatically subject to a perfected security interest under the applicable Security Documents or a
Restricted Subsidiary (including a newly created one) becomes a Guarantor, then such Issuer or such
Guarantor will, as applicable, promptly (but in any event within 60 days after such property’s acquisition
or such Subsidiary becoming a Guarantor) provide security over such property (or, in the case of a new
Guarantor, all of its assets except Excluded Assets) in favor of the Collateral Agent, cause the Liens to be
duly perfected and deliver certain certificates, opinions, title insurance and surveys in respect thereof as
and to the extent required by the Indenture and the Security Documents; provided that any extensions of
time or waivers as are granted by the Credit Agreement Agent for the comparable requirement under the
Credit Agreement or any related loan document or by the Existing Secured Notes Collateral Agent under
any indenture governing the Existing Secured Notes or any related collateral document shall
automatically be granted under the Indenture and the Security Documents.

**_Control over Collateral; Value of Collateral and Enforcement of Liens_**

The Security Documents will provide that, subject to certain terms and conditions, the Issuers and
the Guarantors are entitled to remain in possession and retain exclusive control over the Collateral (other
than as set forth in the Security Documents).

Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Security Documents
will provide that the Collateral Agent may foreclose upon and sell the applicable Collateral and distribute
the net proceeds of any such sale to the Trustee and the holders of the Notes and other First-Priority
Obligations, subject to the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement (as defined below),
applicable laws and applicable governmental requirements.

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, proceeds realized from the Collateral or in an insolvency
proceeding will be applied:

  - _first, to amounts owing to the Collateral Agent and one or more Authorized Representatives (as_

defined below), in their capacities as such in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement until such amounts are paid in full;

  - _second, to amounts owing to the holders of all First-Priority Obligations on a ratable basis in_

accordance with their respective terms; and

  - _third, to the Issuers and the Guarantors and/or other persons entitled thereto._

The Collateral has not been appraised in connection with this offering. The fair market value of
the Collateral is subject to fluctuations based on factors that include, among others, the condition of the
industry in which the Issuers operate, their ability to implement their business strategy, the ability to sell
the Collateral in an orderly sale, general economic conditions and similar factors. The amount to be
received upon a sale of the Collateral would be dependent on numerous factors, including but not limited
to the actual fair market value of the Collateral at such time, the timing and the manner of the sale and
certain regulatory limits. By its nature, portions of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily
ascertainable market value. Likewise, there can be no assurance that the Collateral will be saleable, or, if
saleable, that there will not be substantial delays in its liquidation. In the event of a foreclosure,

51


-----

liquidation, receivership, bankruptcy or similar proceeding, the Issuers cannot assure you that the
proceeds from any sale or liquidation of the Collateral will be sufficient to pay the Issuers’ and the
Guarantors’ obligations under the Notes.

To the extent that Liens (including Permitted Liens), rights or easements granted to third parties
encumber assets owned by the Issuers or the Guarantors, including the Collateral, such third parties may
exercise rights and remedies with respect to the property subject to such Liens that could adversely affect
the value of the Collateral and the ability of the Collateral Agent, the Trustee or the holders of the Notes
to realize or foreclose on Collateral.

**_Intercreditor Agreement_**

The Collateral Agent will join an intercreditor agreement with the collateral agent under the
Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement Agent”) and the respective collateral agents for the Existing
Secured Notes (the “Existing Secured Notes Collateral Agent”) (as hereafter amended, restated,
supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time (including by joinder), the “Intercreditor
_Agreement”) with respect to the Collateral. The Intercreditor Agreement may be amended from time to_
time, without the consent of the Trustee and the holders of the Notes, to add other parties holding FirstPriority Obligations permitted to be incurred under the Indenture, the indentures governing the Existing
Notes and the Credit Agreement.

The Intercreditor Agreement will govern the relative rights and remedies with respect to the
Collateral of the Credit Agreement Agent on behalf of itself, the administrative agent and the lenders
under the Credit Agreement, the Existing Secured Notes Collateral Agent on behalf of the trustee under
the indentures governing the Existing Secured Notes and the holders of the Existing Secured Notes, the
Collateral Agent on behalf of the Trustee and the holders of the Notes and the holders of any other FirstPriority Obligations.

**_Control over Collateral and Enforcement of Liens_**

Under the Intercreditor Agreement, as described below, the “Controlling Authorized
Representative” will have the right to direct foreclosures and take other actions with respect to the
Common Collateral, and the Authorized Representatives of other series of First-Priority Obligations will
have no right to take actions with respect to the Common Collateral. The Controlling Authorized
Representative will initially be the Credit Agreement Agent and none of the Existing Secured Notes
Collateral Agent, the Collateral Agent for the Trustee and the holders of the Notes, as Authorized
Representative in respect of the Notes, or the Authorized Representative of the holders of any other FirstPriority Obligations will initially have any rights to take any action with respect to the Common
Collateral under the Intercreditor Agreement. The Controlling Authorized Representative may, with the
prior written consent of the Issuers and the Guarantors, additionally enter into any amendment (and, upon
request by the Controlling Authorized Representative, the applicable Authorized Representative shall sign
a consent to such amendment) to any Security Document solely as such Security Document relates to a
particular series of First-Priority Obligations (including, without limitation, to release Liens securing such
series of First-Priority Obligations); provided that any such amendment is in accordance with the
agreements governing the First-Priority Obligations pursuant to which such series of First-Priority
Obligations was incurred and such amendment does not adversely affect the First-Priority Secured Parties
of any other series. The Controlling Authorized Representative shall provide a copy of such amendment
to the Trustee. The Controlling Authorized Representative shall provide a copy of such amendment to
each Noncontrolling Authorized Representative and to the Trustee.

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that if, in connection with any sale, lease, exchange,
transfer or other disposition of any Common Collateral permitted under the terms of the Secured Credit

52


-----

Documents (whether or not an Event of Default thereunder, and as defined therein, has occurred and is
continuing), the Controlling Authorized Representative, for itself or on behalf of the applicable FirstPriority Secured Parties, releases any of its Liens on any part of the Common Collateral (but not the
proceeds thereof which shall be subject to the priorities set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement), then the
Liens, if any, of each Noncontrolling Authorized Representative on such Common Collateral shall be
automatically, unconditionally and simultaneously released, and each Noncontrolling Authorized
Representative promptly shall execute, if applicable, and deliver to the Controlling Authorized
Representative or the Issuers such termination statements, releases, authorizations and other documents
and instruments, and shall take or authorize the Controlling Authorized Representative or the Issuers to
take such action (including any recordation, filing or giving of notice), as the Controlling Authorized
Representative or the Issuers may reasonably request to effectively confirm such release.

The Credit Agreement Agent will remain the Controlling Authorized Representative until the
earlier of (1) the payment of Obligations under the Credit Agreement (other than contingent Obligations
under the Credit Agreement in respect of which no claim has been made) and (2) the Noncontrolling
Authorized Representative Enforcement Date (provided that if there shall occur more than one
Noncontrolling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date, the applicable Authorized Representative
shall be the Authorized Representative that is the Major Noncontrolling Authorized Representative in
respect of the most recent Noncontrolling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date) (such earlier
date, the “Applicable Authorized Agent Date”). From and after the Applicable Authorized Agent Date, the
Controlling Authorized Representative will be the Authorized Representative of the Noncontrolling
Secured Parties of the series of First-Priority Obligations that constitutes the largest outstanding principal
amount of any then-outstanding series of First-Priority Obligations with respect to the Common Collateral
(the “Major Noncontrolling Authorized Representative”).

The “Noncontrolling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date” is the date that is 180 days
(throughout which 180-day period the applicable Noncontrolling Authorized Representative was the
Major Noncontrolling Authorized Representative) after the occurrence of both (a) an Event of Default, as
defined in the Indenture or other applicable indenture or agreement for that series of First-Priority
Obligations, and (b) the Controlling Authorized Representative’s and each other Authorized
Representative’s receipt of written notice from that Authorized Representative certifying that (i) such
Noncontrolling Authorized Representative is the Major Noncontrolling Authorized Representative and
that an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture or other applicable indenture or agreement for that
series of First-Priority Obligations, has occurred and is continuing and (ii) the First-Priority Obligations
of that series are currently due and payable in full (whether as a result of acceleration thereof or
otherwise) in accordance with the Indenture or other applicable indenture or agreement for that series of
First-Priority Obligations; provided that the Noncontrolling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date
shall be stayed and shall not occur and shall be deemed not to have occurred with respect to any Common
Collateral (1) at any time the Controlling Authorized Representative has commenced and is diligently
pursuing any enforcement action with respect to such Common Collateral or (2) at any time any Issuer or
any Guarantor that has granted a security interest in such Common Collateral is then a debtor under or
with respect to (or otherwise subject to) any insolvency or liquidation proceeding.

The Controlling Authorized Representative shall have the sole right to act or refrain from acting
with respect to enforcement proceedings in respect of the Common Collateral. The Controlling
Authorized Representative shall not follow any instructions with respect to such Common Collateral from
any Authorized Representative of any Noncontrolling Secured Party or First-Priority Secured Party (other
than the requisite Controlling Secured Parties under the applicable Secured Credit Documents), and no
Authorized Representative of any Noncontrolling Secured Party or other First-Priority Secured Party
(other than the requisite Controlling Secured Parties under the applicable Secured Credit Documents) will
instruct the Controlling Authorized Representative to commence any judicial or non-judicial foreclosure
proceedings with respect to, seek to have a trustee, receiver, liquidator or similar official appointed for or

53


-----

over, attempt any action to take possession of, exercise any right, remedy or power with respect to, or
otherwise take any action to enforce its security interest in or realize upon, or take any other action
available to it in respect of, the Common Collateral.

Notwithstanding the equal priority of the Liens on the Common Collateral, the Controlling
Authorized Representative, acting on the instructions of the requisite Controlling Secured Parties under
the applicable Secured Credit Documents, may deal with the Common Collateral as if such Controlling
Authorized Representative had a senior Lien on such Collateral. No Authorized Representative of any
Noncontrolling Secured Party or any Noncontrolling Secured Party may contest, protest or object to any
foreclosure proceeding or action brought by the Controlling Authorized Representative. The Collateral
Agent and each other Authorized Representative will agree that it will not accept any Lien on any
Common Collateral for the benefit of the holders of Notes or of any other series of First-Priority
Obligations, as applicable (other than funds deposited for the discharge or defeasance of the Indenture or
the agreement governing such other series of First-Priority Obligations, as applicable), other than
pursuant to the Security Documents and the security documents governing any other series of FirstPriority Obligations (collectively, the “First-Priority Collateral Documents”). Each of the First-Priority
Secured Parties also will agree (and pursuant to the Indenture the Trustee will be instructed, in writing, to
agree) that it will not (and will waive any right to) contest or support any other person in contesting, in
any proceeding (including any insolvency or liquidation proceeding), the perfection, priority, validity or
enforceability of a Lien held by or on behalf of any of the First-Priority Secured Parties in all or any part
of the Collateral, or the enforceability of the Intercreditor Agreement. The Intercreditor Agreement
provides that, if any Common Collateral is transferred to a third party or otherwise disposed of in
connection with any enforcement by the Controlling Authorized Representative thereunder and in
accordance with the terms thereof and the applicable First-Priority Collateral Documents, the Liens in
favor of each Authorized Representative for the benefit of each series of First-Priority Secured Parties
upon such Common Collateral will be automatically released and discharged.

If an Event of Default or any event of default with respect to any other First-Priority Obligations
has occurred and is continuing and the Controlling Authorized Representative or any First-Priority
Secured Party is taking action to enforce rights in respect of any Common Collateral, or any distribution
is made in respect of any Common Collateral in any bankruptcy case of any Issuer or any Guarantor or
any First-Priority Secured Party receives any payment pursuant to any intercreditor agreement (other than
the Intercreditor Agreement) with respect to any Common Collateral, the proceeds of any sale, collection
or other liquidation of any such Collateral by any First-Priority Secured Party or received by the
Controlling Authorized Representative or any First-Priority Secured Party pursuant to any such
intercreditor agreement with respect to such Common Collateral and proceeds of any such distribution
(subject, in the case of any such distribution, to the paragraph immediately following) to which the FirstPriority Obligations are entitled under any other intercreditor agreement shall be applied among the FirstPriority Obligations as set forth under “—Control over Collateral and Enforcement of Liens” above.

None of the First-Priority Secured Parties may institute any suit or assert in any suit, bankruptcy,
insolvency or other proceeding any claim against the Controlling Authorized Representative or any other
First-Priority Secured Party seeking damages from or other relief by way of specific performance,
instructions or otherwise with respect to any Common Collateral. In addition, none of the First-Priority
Secured Parties may seek to have any Common Collateral or any part thereof marshaled upon any
foreclosure or other disposition of such Collateral. If any First-Priority Secured Party obtains possession
of any Common Collateral or realizes any proceeds or payment in respect thereof, at any time prior to the
discharge of each series of First-Priority Obligations, then it must hold such Common Collateral,
proceeds or payment in trust for the other First-Priority Secured Parties and promptly transfer such
Common Collateral, proceeds or payment to the Controlling Authorized Representative to be distributed
in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement.

54


-----

**_Intervening Liens_**

Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Common Collateral for which a third party
(other than a First-Priority Secured Party and after giving effect to any other applicable intercreditor
agreements) has a lien or security interest that is junior in priority to the security interest of any series of
First-Priority Obligations but senior (as determined by appropriate legal proceedings in the case of any
dispute) to the security interest of any other series of First-Priority Obligations (such third party, an
“Intervening Creditor”), the value of any Common Collateral or proceeds which are allocated to such
Intervening Creditor shall be deducted on a ratable basis solely from the Common Collateral or proceeds
to be distributed in respect of the series of First-Priority Obligations with respect to which such
impairment exists.

**_Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding_**

If any Issuer or any Guarantor becomes subject to any bankruptcy case, the Intercreditor
Agreement provides that, if any Issuer or any Guarantor shall, as debtor(s)-in-possession, move for
approval of financing (the “DIP Financing”) to be provided by one or more lenders (the “DIP Lenders”)
under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code or the use of cash collateral under Section 363 of the
Bankruptcy Code, each First-Priority Secured Party (other than any Controlling Secured Party or the
Controlling Authorized Representative) will agree (and pursuant to the Indenture the Trustee will be
instructed, in writing, to agree) not to object to any such DIP Financing or to the Liens on the Common
Collateral securing the same (the “DIP Financing Liens”) or to any use of cash collateral that constitutes
Common Collateral, unless any Controlling Secured Party, or the Controlling Authorized Representative,
shall then oppose or object to such DIP Financing or such DIP Financing Liens or such use of cash
collateral (and (i) to the extent that such DIP Financing Liens are senior to the Liens on any such
Common Collateral for the benefit of the Controlling Secured Parties, each Noncontrolling Secured Party
will subordinate its Liens with respect to such Common Collateral on the same terms as the Liens of the
Controlling Secured Parties (other than any Liens of any First-Priority Secured Parties constituting DIP
Financing Liens) are subordinated thereto, and (ii) to the extent that such DIP Financing Liens rank pari
_passu with the Liens on any such Common Collateral granted to secure the First-Priority Obligations of_
the Controlling Secured Parties, each Noncontrolling Secured Party will confirm the priorities with
respect to such Common Collateral as set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement), in each case so long as:

(A) the First-Priority Secured Parties of each series retain the benefit of their Liens on all such

Common Collateral pledged to the DIP Lenders, including proceeds thereof arising after the
commencement of such proceeding, with the same priority vis-à-vis all the other FirstPriority Secured Parties (other than any Liens of the First-Priority Secured Parties
constituting DIP Financing Liens) as existed prior to the commencement of the bankruptcy
case;

(B) the First-Priority Secured Parties of each series are granted Liens on any additional collateral

pledged to any First-Priority Secured Parties as adequate protection or otherwise in
connection with such DIP Financing or use of cash collateral, with the same priority vis-àvis the First-Priority Secured Parties as set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement;

(C) if any amount of such DIP Financing or cash collateral is applied to repay any of the First
Priority Obligations, such amount is applied pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement; and

(D) if any First-Priority Secured Parties are granted adequate protection, including in the form of

periodic payments, in connection with such DIP Financing or use of cash collateral, the
proceeds of such adequate protection is applied pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement;

55

_provided that the First-Priority Secured Parties of each series shall have a right to object (and the_
Trustee will do so at the written direction of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes) to
the grant of a Lien to secure the DIP Financing over any Collateral subject to Liens in favor of the FirstPriority Secured Parties of such series or its Authorized Representative that shall not constitute Common
Collateral; and provided, further, that the First-Priority Secured Parties receiving adequate protection shall
not object to any other First-Priority Secured Party receiving adequate protection comparable to any
adequate protection granted to such First-Priority Secured Parties in connection with a DIP Financing or
use of cash collateral.

The First-Priority Secured Parties shall acknowledge (and the Trustee pursuant to the Indenture
shall be instructed in writing to acknowledge) that the First-Priority Obligations of any series may,
subject to the limitations set forth in the other Secured Credit Documents, be increased, extended,
renewed, replaced, restated, supplemented, restructured, repaid, refunded, refinanced or otherwise
amended or modified from time to time, all without affecting the priorities set forth in the Intercreditor
Agreement defining the relative rights of the First-Priority Secured Parties of any series.

As used in this section, the following terms have the meanings set out below:

“Authorized Representative” means (i) in the case of the Notes, the Collateral Agent, (ii) in the
case of the Credit Agreement, the Credit Agreement Agent, (iii) in the case of the Existing Secured Notes,
the Existing Secured Notes Collateral Agent and (iv) in the case of any other series of First-Priority
Obligation that become subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, the person named as the authorized
representative for such series in the applicable joinder agreement.

“Common Collateral” means, at any time, such portion of the Collateral in which the holders of
two or more series of First-Priority Obligations (or their respective Authorized Representatives) hold a
valid and perfected security interest at such time; provided that collateral consisting of cash and Cash
Equivalents pledged to secure obligations in respect of the Credit Agreement consisting of reimbursement
obligations in respect of letters of credit or otherwise held by the administrative agent thereunder pursuant
to the letter of credit provisions of the credit agreement governing the Credit Agreement (or any successor
provision) shall be applied as specified in the credit agreement or such successor provision and will not
constitute Common Collateral. If more than two series of First-Priority Obligations are outstanding at any
time and the holders of less than all series of First-Priority Obligations hold a valid and perfected security
interest in any portion of the Collateral at such time, then such portion of the Collateral shall constitute
Common Collateral for those series of First-Priority Obligations that hold a valid security interest in such
portion of the Collateral at such time and shall not constitute Common Collateral for any series which
does not have a valid and perfected security interest in such portion of the Collateral at such time.

“Controlling Authorized Representative” means, with respect to any Common Collateral, (i) until
the Applicable Authorized Agent Date, the Credit Agreement Agent and (ii) from and after the Applicable
Authorized Agent Date, the Major Noncontrolling Authorized Representative (provided that if there shall
occur more than one Noncontrolling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date after the applicable
Authorized Agent Date, the Controlling Authorized Representative shall be the Authorized
Representative that is the Major Noncontrolling Authorized Representative in respect of the most recent
Noncontrolling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date). “Controlling Secured Parties” means, with
respect to any Common Collateral, the series of First-Priority Secured Parties whose Authorized
Representative is the Controlling Authorized Representative for such Common Collateral.

“First-Priority Secured Parties” means the persons holding any First-Priority Obligations,
including the Collateral Agent and the Trustee.

56


-----

“Noncontrolling Authorized Representative” means any Authorized Representative that is not the
Controlling Authorized Representative.

“Noncontrolling Secured Parties” means, with respect to any Common Collateral, the FirstPriority Secured Parties which are not Controlling Secured Parties with respect to such Common
Collateral.

**_Release of Liens_**

The Security Documents and the Indenture provide that the Liens securing the obligations of a
Co-Issuer or the Note Guarantee of any Guarantor will be automatically released when such Co-Issuer’s
obligations under the Indenture or such Guarantor’s Note Guarantee, as applicable, is released in
accordance with the terms of the Indenture and/or the Security Documents. In addition, the Liens on the
Collateral with respect to Obligations under the Indenture, the Security Documents and the Notes will be
released:

(a) upon defeasance or discharge of the Notes and the Indenture as provided under “—
Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge”;

(b) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other Obligations (other than
contingent Obligations in respect of which no claims have been made) on the Notes
issued under the Indenture;

(c) in whole or in part, in accordance with the provisions set forth under “—Modification
and Waiver”;

(d) in connection with any sale, transfer or other disposition of any Collateral to any
Person other than the Company or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries (but excluding
any transaction subject to “—Certain Covenants—Consolidation, Merger and
Conveyance, Transfer and Lease of Assets” where the recipient is required to become
the obligor on the Notes or a Note Guarantee) that does not violate any of the terms of
the Indenture (with respect to the Lien on such Collateral);

(e) in whole or in part, in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement;

(f) as to any Collateral that becomes an Excluded Asset; or

(g) upon the occurrence of the Covenant Suspension Event, as provided under “—
Covenant Suspension When Notes Obtain Investment Grade Rating.”

**_No Impairment of the Security Interests_**

Neither the Issuers nor any of the Guarantors will be permitted to take any action, or knowingly
or negligently omit to take any action, which action or omission would have the result of materially
impairing the security interest with respect to the Collateral for the benefit of the Trustee and the holders
of the Notes.

The Indenture will provide that any release of Collateral in accordance with the provisions thereof
and the applicable Security Documents will not be deemed to impair the security thereunder.

57


-----

**Optional Redemption**

At any time and from time to time prior to     , 2025, the Issuers may redeem some or all of
the Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed plus
the Applicable Premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.

At any time on or after      , 2025, the Issuers may redeem some or all of the Notes at the
redemption prices (expressed in percentage of principal amount) set forth below, plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, if redeemed during the twelve-month period
beginning on          of each of the years indicated below:

**Year** **Price**
2025 ................................................................................................................................... %
2026 ................................................................................................................................... %
2027 and thereafter ............................................................................................................. 100.000%

In addition, at any time prior to       , 2025, the Issuers may redeem up to 40% of the original
principal amount of the outstanding Notes (including Additional Notes, if any) with the net cash proceeds
of one or more Equity Offerings at a redemption price (expressed as a percentage of principal amount)
of       %, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date; provided
that (i) at least 55% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes originally issued on the date of the
Indenture remains outstanding after each such redemption and (ii) notice of any such redemption is
delivered to the Trustee within 90 days of the closing of each such Equity Offering.

Notwithstanding anything in “—Optional Redemption” to the contrary, installments of interest on
the Notes that are due and payable on Interest Payment Dates falling on or prior to a redemption date will
be payable on the Interest Payment Date to the registered holders as of the close of business on the
relevant Record Date according to the Notes and the Indenture.

**_Notice of Redemption_**

The Issuers will prepare and give, or cause to be given, a notice of redemption to each holder of
Notes of a series to be redeemed at least 10 and not more than 60 calendar days prior to the date fixed for
redemption, except that notices of redemption may be given more than 60 days prior to a redemption date
if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Notes of a series or a satisfaction and
discharge of the Indenture. On and after a redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes
called for redemption unless the Issuers default in the payment of the redemption price and accrued
interest. At or before 11:00 a.m., London time, on the redemption date, the Issuers will deposit with the
paying agent (or the Trustee) money sufficient to pay the redemption price of and accrued interest on the
Notes to be redeemed on the redemption date. If fewer than all of the Notes of a series are to be
redeemed, the Notes of such series to be redeemed shall be selected by the registrar pro rata or by lot or
by a method the registrar deems to be fair and appropriate and, in respect of global Notes, shall be
selected pro rata subject to the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable. Neither
the Trustee nor the Paying Agent nor the Registrar will be liable for any selections made in accordance
with this paragraph.

Any redemption or notice of redemption may, in the Issuers’ discretion, be subject to one or more
conditions precedent. If any such redemption or notice is subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions
precedent, such notice shall state that, in the Issuers’ discretion, the redemption date may be delayed until
such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied (or waived by the Issuers in their sole discretion),
or such redemption may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such

58


-----

conditions shall not have been satisfied (or waived) by the redemption date, or by the redemption date so
delayed and such redemption provisions may be adjusted to comply with the requirements of the
depositary.

**Additional Amounts**

All payments of principal and interest in respect of the Notes by the Issuers or the paying agent
on their behalf will be made free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for or on account of,
any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or other similar governmental charges imposed or levied
by the United States or any political subdivision or taxing authority of or in the United States
(collectively, “U.S. Taxes”), unless such withholding or deduction is required by law.

In the event such withholding or deduction for U.S. Taxes is required by law, subject to the
limitations described below, the Issuers will pay to or on account of any Non-U.S. Holder (as defined in
“U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations” in this offering memorandum) or any non-U.S. entity that is
treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes such additional amounts (“Additional
_Amounts”) as may be necessary to ensure that the net amount received by the beneficial owner of a Note,_
after withholding or deduction for such U.S. Taxes, will be equal to the amount such person would have
received in the absence of such withholding or deduction.

However, no Additional Amounts shall be payable with respect to any U.S. Taxes if such U.S.
Taxes are imposed or levied for reasons unrelated to the holder’s or beneficial owner’s ownership or
disposition of Notes, nor shall Additional Amounts be payable for or on account of:

(1) any U.S. Taxes which would not have been so imposed, withheld or deducted but for:

(i) the existence of any present or former connection between the holder or beneficial owner (or

between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder or other equity owner of, or a
person having a power over, such holder or beneficial owner, if such holder or beneficial owner is
an estate, a trust, a limited liability company, a partnership, a corporation or other entity) and the
United States, including, without limitation, such holder or beneficial owner (or such fiduciary,
settlor, beneficiary, member, shareholder or other equity owner or person having such a power)
being or having been a citizen or resident or treated as a resident of the United States, being or
having been engaged in a trade or business in the United States, being or having been present in
the United States, or having or having had a permanent establishment in the United States;

(ii) the failure of the holder or any other person to comply with certification, identification or

information reporting requirements concerning the nationality, residence, identity or connection
with the United States of the holder or beneficial owner of the Notes, if compliance is required by
statute, by regulation of the United States or any taxing authority therein or by an applicable income
tax treaty to which the United States is a party as a precondition to partial or complete exemption
from such tax, assessment or other governmental charge (including, but not limited to, the
requirement to provide Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN, Form W-8BEN-E, Form W-8ECI,
Form W-8IMY (and related documentation) or any subsequent versions thereof or successor
thereto); or

(iii) the holder’s or beneficial owner’s present or former status as a personal holding company with

respect to the United States, as a controlled foreign corporation with respect to the United States,
as a passive foreign investment company with respect to the United States, as a foreign tax exempt
organization with respect to the United States or as a corporation that accumulates earnings to avoid
United States federal income tax;

59


-----

(2) any U.S. Taxes which would not have been imposed, withheld or deducted but for the failure of the

holder or beneficial owner to meet the requirements (including the certification requirements) of
Section 871(h) or Section 881(c) of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the “Code”);

(3) any U.S. Taxes which would not have been imposed, withheld or deducted but for the presentation

by the holder or beneficial owner of such Note for payment on a date more than 30 days after the
date on which such payment became due and payable or the date on which payment of the Note is
duly provided for and notice is given to holders, whichever occurs later, except to the extent that
the holder or beneficial owner would have been entitled to such Additional Amounts on presenting
such Note on any date during such 30-day period;

(4) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, excise, transfer, personal property, wealth or similar U.S. Taxes;

(5) any U.S. Taxes which are payable otherwise than by withholding or deduction from a payment on

such Note;

(6) any U.S. Taxes which are imposed, withheld or deducted with respect to, or payable by, a holder

that is not the beneficial owner of the Note, or a portion of the Note, or that is a fiduciary,
partnership, limited liability company or other similar entity, but only to the extent that a beneficial
owner, a beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary or member of such partnership, limited
liability company or similar entity would not have been entitled to the payment of an Additional
Amount had such beneficial owner, settlor, beneficiary or member received directly its beneficial
or distributive share of the payment;

(7) any U.S. Taxes required to be withheld or deducted by any paying agent from any payment on any

Note, if such payment can be made without such withholding or deduction by at least one other
paying agent;

(8) any U.S. Taxes imposed, withheld or deducted under Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (or

any amended or successor provisions), any current or future regulations or official interpretations
thereof, any agreement entered into pursuant to Section 1471(b) of the Code or any fiscal or
regulatory legislation, rules or practices adopted pursuant to any intergovernmental agreement
entered into in connection with the implementation of such sections of the Code;

(9) any U.S. Taxes that would not have been imposed, withheld or deducted but for a change in any

law, treaty, regulation, or administrative or judicial interpretation that becomes effective more than
15 days after the applicable payment becomes due or is duly provided for, whichever occurs later;
or

(10) any combination of items (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8) and (9).

For purposes of this section, the acquisition, ownership, enforcement, or holding of or the receipt
of any payment with respect to the Notes will not constitute a connection (1) between the holder or
beneficial owner and the United States or (2) between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or
shareholder or other equity owner of, or a person having a power over, such holder or beneficial owner if
such holder or beneficial owner is an estate, a trust, a limited liability company, a partnership, a
corporation or other entity and the United States.

Except as specifically provided under this section “Additional Amounts,” the Issuers will not be
required to make any payment with respect to any tax, duty, assessment or other governmental charge
imposed by any government or any political subdivision or taxing authority.

60


-----

If the Issuers are required to pay Additional Amounts with respect to the Notes, the Issuers will
notify the Trustee and the paying agent pursuant to an Officer’s Certificate that specifies the Additional
Amounts payable with respect to the Notes and when the Additional Amounts are payable. The Trustee
and Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that
such payments are necessary, without further inquiry, investigation, independent verification or liability
of any kind. If the Trustee and the paying agent do not receive such an Officer’s Certificate from the
Issuers, the Trustee and the paying agent may rely conclusively on the absence of such an Officer’s
Certificate in assuming that no such Additional Amounts are payable.

Wherever in the Indenture, the Notes or this “Description of Notes” there is mentioned, in any
context, with respect to the Notes:

1) the payment of principal;

2) purchase prices in connection with a purchase of Notes;

3) interest; or

4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any Note Guarantee,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such
context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

**Redemption for Tax Reasons**

The Issuers may, at their option, redeem the Notes, in whole but not in part, at a redemption price
equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, together with any accrued and unpaid
interest thereon to, but excluding, the redemption date, at any time, if the Issuers have or, based upon a
written opinion of independent tax counsel of nationally recognized standing selected by the Issuers, will
become obliged to pay Additional Amounts with respect to the Notes as a result of any change in, or
amendment to, the laws, regulations, treaties, or rulings of the United States or any political subdivision
of or in the United States or any taxing authority thereof or therein affecting taxation, or any change in, or
amendment to, the application, official interpretation, administration or enforcement of such laws,
regulations, treaties or rulings (including a holding by a court of competent jurisdiction in the United
States), which change or amendment is enacted, adopted, announced or becomes effective on or after the
date of this offering memorandum and the Issuers cannot avoid such payment obligation by taking
commercially reasonable measures available to them.

Notice of any redemption will be given pursuant to the procedures described under “—Optional
Redemption— Notice of Redemption”; provided that the notice of redemption shall not be given earlier
than 90 days before the earliest date on which the Issuers would be obligated to pay such Additional
Amounts on the Notes if a payment was then due.

Notice of any redemption described above or notice thereof may, at the Issuers’ discretion, be subject to
one or more conditions precedent as provided under “—Optional Redemption—Notice of Redemption.”

**No Mandatory Redemption; Offer to Repurchase; Open Market Purchases**

The Issuers are not required to make any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with
respect to the Notes. However, under certain circumstances, the Issuers may be required to offer to
repurchase Notes as described under the caption “—Repurchase of Notes upon a Change of Control
Triggering Event.” The Issuers may at any time and from time to time purchase Notes in the open market,
pursuant to negotiated transactions or otherwise, which may include a consent solicitation.

61


-----

**Repurchase of Notes upon a Change of Control Triggering Event**

If a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs with respect to the Notes, unless the Issuers at
such time have given notice of redemption pursuant to the first or second paragraph under the caption “—
Optional Redemption” or terms described under “—Redemption for Tax Reasons,” as applicable, with
respect to all outstanding Notes, the Issuers will offer to repurchase all or any part (in minimum principal
amount of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof) of each holder’s Notes pursuant to
an offer to repurchase on the terms set forth in the Indenture (a “Change of Control Offer”). In the Change
of Control Offer, the Issuers will offer a payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount
of the Notes being repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes being repurchased, to, but
excluding, the date of repurchase (the “Change of Control Payment”). Within 30 days following any
Change of Control Triggering Event with respect to the Notes, unless the Issuers at such time have given
notice of redemption as described in the first sentence of this paragraph with respect to all outstanding
Notes, the Issuers will give a notice to each holder of such Notes, with a written copy to the Trustee,
describing the transaction or transactions and ratings downgrade that constitute the Change of Control
Triggering Event and offering to repurchase the Notes on the date specified in the notice (the “Change of
_Control Payment Date”), which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the_
date such notice is given, pursuant to the procedures required by the Indenture and described in such
notice.

The Issuers will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any
other securities laws and regulations thereunder, if any, to the extent those laws and regulations are
applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering
Event. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of
Control Triggering Event provisions of the Indenture, the Issuers will comply with the applicable
securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached their obligations under the
Change of Control Triggering Event provisions of the Indenture by virtue of such conflict.

At or prior to 11:00 a.m., London time, on the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuers will,
to the extent lawful, deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in
respect of all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered. On the Change of Control Payment Date, the
Issuers will, to the extent lawful, (i) accept for payment all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered
and not withdrawn pursuant to the Change of Control Offer and (ii) deliver or cause to be delivered to the
Trustee the Notes properly accepted, together with an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal
amount of Notes or portions of Notes being repurchased by the Issuers.

The paying agent will promptly deliver to each holder of Notes properly tendered the Change of
Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be
transferred by book-entry) to each holder a new Note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased
portion of the Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each new Note will be in a minimum principal
amount of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The Issuers will publicly
announce the results of the Change of Control Offer on or as soon as practicable after the Change of
Control Payment Date.

The Issuers will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control
Triggering Event with respect to the Notes if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the
manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture
applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuers and repurchases all Notes properly tendered
and not withdrawn under the Change of Control Offer or (ii) a valid notice of redemption for all of the
Notes has been given, or will be given contemporaneously with the Change of Control Triggering Event,
pursuant to the terms of the Indenture as described under “—Optional Redemption” or “—Redemption
for Tax Reasons” unless and until such notice has been validly revoked or there is a default in the

62


-----

payment of the applicable redemption price. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of
Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event or conditional upon the
occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change
of Control Triggering Event at the time the Change of Control Offer is made.

In the event that holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the thenoutstanding Notes accept a Change of Control Offer and the Issuers (or any third party making such
Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Issuers as described above) purchase all of the Notes validly
tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, the Issuers or such third party will have the right, upon not
less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 60 days following the repurchase
pursuant to the Change of Control Offer described above, to redeem all of the Notes that remain
outstanding following such repurchase at a redemption price equal to the Change of Control Payment,
plus to the extent not included in the Change of Control Payment, accrued and unpaid interest on the
Notes that remain outstanding to, but excluding, the date of repurchase. In determining whether the
holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the then-outstanding Notes accept a Change
of Control Offer, Notes owned by an Affiliate of the Issuers shall be deemed to be outstanding for the
purposes of such Change of Control Offer.

The Credit Agreement provides that the occurrence of certain change of control events with
respect to the Company will constitute a default thereunder.

Other indebtedness that the Issuers or their Subsidiaries have incurred or may incur may contain
prohibitions on the occurrence of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or require the
repurchase of such indebtedness upon a Change of Control Triggering Event. Moreover, the exercise by
the holders of their right to require the Issuers to repurchase their Notes could cause a default under such
indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase
on the Issuers. Finally, the Issuers’ ability to pay cash to the holders of Notes following the occurrence of
a Change of Control Triggering Event may be limited by their then-existing financial resources. There can
be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases.

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control Triggering Event, the Indenture
will contain no provisions that permit the holders of the Notes to require that the Issuers repurchase or
redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction.

The definition of Change of Control includes a phrase relating to the direct or indirect sale, lease,
transfer, conveyance or other disposition of “all or substantially all” of the properties or assets of the
Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting
the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law.
Accordingly, the ability of a holder of Notes to require the Issuers to repurchase their Notes as a result of
a sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of less than all of the assets of the Company and its
subsidiaries taken as a whole to another Person or group may be uncertain.

The Change of Control Triggering Event repurchase feature of the Notes may in certain
circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of the Company and, thus, the
removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control Triggering Event repurchase feature is a
result of negotiations between the initial purchasers and the Issuers. As of the Issue Date, the Issuers have
no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control, although it is possible that
they could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Issuers could, in
the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations,
that would not constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event under the Indenture, but that could
increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect the Company’s capital
structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on the Issuers’ ability to incur additional Indebtedness are

63


-----

contained in the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of
Indebtedness.” Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of holders of a
majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for limitations contained in such
covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford holders of
the Notes protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction.

The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuers’ obligation to make an offer to
repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event with respect to such Notes may
be waived or modified with the written consent of a majority in principal amount of the Notes.

**Exchange and Transfer**

Holders generally will be able to exchange Notes for other Notes with the same total principal
amount and the same terms.

Holders may present Notes for exchange or for registration of transfer at the Corporate Trust
Office or at the office of any transfer agent designated for that purpose. The registrar or designated
transfer agent will exchange or transfer the Notes if it is satisfied with the documents of title and identity
of the Person making the request; provided that such transfer complies with the restrictions specified in
the section of this offering memorandum titled “Transfer Restrictions.” The Issuers will not charge a
service charge for any exchange or registration of transfer of Notes. However, the Issuers and the registrar
may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable for the
registration of transfer or exchange. The Issuers have initially appointed the Trustee as registrar in respect
of the Notes.

At any time the Issuers may (i) designate additional transfer agents, (ii) rescind the designation of
any transfer agent, or (iii) approve a change in the office of any transfer agent.

However, the Issuers are required to maintain a transfer agent in each place of payment for the
Notes at all times.

If the Issuers elect to redeem the Notes or makes a Change of Control Offer with respect to the
Notes, neither the Issuers nor the Trustee will be required to:

  - issue, register the transfer of or exchange any Notes during the period beginning at the opening of

business 15 calendar days before the day the Issuers give the notice of redemption or make the
Change of Control Offer and ending at the close of business on the day the notice is given or the
Change of Control Offer is made;

  - register the transfer or exchange of any Note so selected for redemption or subject to repurchase

in such Change of Control Offer, except for any portion not to be redeemed or subject to
repurchase; or

  - in the case of a redemption or a Change of Control Payment Date occurring after a regular record

date but on or before the corresponding Interest Payment Date, register the transfer or exchange
of any Note on or after the regular Record Date and before the date of redemption or repurchase.

  - The Issuers, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar will be entitled

to treat the registered holder of a Note as the owner thereof for all purposes

64


-----

**Payment and Paying Agents**

Under the Indenture, the Issuers will pay interest on the Notes to the Persons in whose names the
Notes are registered at the close of business on the regular Record Date for each interest payment.
However, the Issuers will pay the interest payable on the Notes at their stated maturity to the Persons to
whom the Issuers pay the principal amount of the Notes.

The Issuers will pay principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes at the Corporate Trust
Office or the offices of the designated paying agents.

(i) All cash payments of principal or premium, if any, and interest with respect to the Notes
represented by one or more global notes registered in the name of or held by the common depositary of
Euroclear and Clearstream or its nominee will be made through the paying agent by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the registered Holder or Holders thereof and (ii)
all cash payments of principal or premium, if any, and interest with respect to certificated Notes may, at
the option of the Company, be made by wire transfer to a euro account maintained by the payee with a
bank in the United Kingdom or Europe if the applicable Holder elects payment by wire transfer by giving
written notice to the Trustee or the paying agent to such effect designating such account no later than 30
days immediately preceding the relevant due date for payment (or such other date as the Trustee may
accept). Until otherwise designated by the Company, the Company’s office or agency will be the office of
the paying agent maintained for such purpose in London, United Kingdom.

The Issuers will initially designate Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch as paying agent for the
Notes. The Issuers may at any time appoint new paying agents, transfer agents and registrars. At any time,
the Issuers may designate additional paying agents or rescind the designation of any paying agents.
However, the Issuers are required to maintain a paying agent in each place of payment for the Notes at all
times.

Any money deposited with the Trustee or any paying agent for the payment of principal,
premium, if any, and interest on the Notes that remains unclaimed for the earlier of (i) two years after the

As of the Issue Date, all of the Company’s Subsidiaries are Restricted Subsidiaries. The Company
will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to become an Unrestricted Subsidiary except pursuant to “—
Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries.” For purposes of designating any Restricted
Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, all outstanding Investments by the Company and its Restricted
Subsidiaries (except to the extent repaid) in the Subsidiary so designated will be deemed to be an
Investment in an amount determined as set forth in the definition of “Investment.” Such designation will
be permitted only if an Investment in such amount would be permitted at such time, whether as a
Restricted Payment or a Permitted Investment, and if such Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an
Unrestricted Subsidiary. Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the covenants set forth in
the Indenture.

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) will be the fair market value on the date
of the Restricted Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be transferred or issued by the
Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to the Restricted Payment. The fair
market value of any assets or securities that are required to be valued by this covenant will be determined
by the Board of Directors of the Company or senior management thereof whose good faith determination
will be conclusive.

Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) and the Company will not issue any shares of
Disqualified Stock and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to issue any shares of Disqualified Stock
or Preferred Stock; provided, however, that the Company may incur Indebtedness (including Acquired
Indebtedness) or issue shares of Disqualified Stock, and any Restricted Subsidiary may incur
Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness), issue shares of Disqualified Stock and issue shares of
Preferred Stock, if the Total Net Leverage Ratio at the time such additional Indebtedness is incurred or
such Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock is issued would have been no greater than 5.50 to 1.00,
determined on a Pro Forma Basis (including the application on a Pro Forma Basis of the net proceeds
therefrom), as if the additional Indebtedness had been incurred, or the Disqualified Stock or Preferred
Stock had been issued, as the case may be, and the application of proceeds therefrom had occurred at the
beginning of the most recently ended Measurement Period; provided _further, however, that Non-_
Guarantor Subsidiaries may not incur Indebtedness or issue Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock if, after
giving Pro Forma Effect to such incurrence or issuance, the amount of Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock
or Preferred Stock of Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries outstanding pursuant to this paragraph (together with

incurrence, the then-outstanding aggregate principal amount of all Indebtedness under this
clause (1) does not exceed at any one time the sum of (i) $5,350 million and (ii) (x) $1,750
million (the “Fixed Incremental Amount”), plus (y)(A) additional amounts of First Lien
Indebtedness if, after giving effect to the incurrence thereof (but excluding the cash

on a Pro Forma Basis, with a Consolidated Senior Secured First Lien Debt Ratio of not
more than 3.00:1.00 and (B) additional amounts of Secured Indebtedness (other than First
Lien Indebtedness) if, after giving effect to the incurrence thereof but excluding the cash

to such incurrence of Indebtedness on a Pro Forma Basis; and (c) if such Indebtedness is (x)
unsecured and incurred by an Issuer or a Guarantor or (y) incurred by a Non-Guarantor
Subsidiary, the Total Net Leverage Ratio would be no greater than the Total Net Leverage
Ratio immediately prior to giving effect to such incurrence of Indebtedness on a Pro Forma
Basis, in each case together with any Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof;
_provided that Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries may not incur Indebtedness pursuant to this_
clause (31) if, after such incurrence, on a Pro Forma Basis, the amount of Indebtedness of
Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries outstanding pursuant to this clause (31) and the first paragraph
of this “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness” exceeds the greater of $300,000,000
and 18.0% of Adjusted EBITDA as of the last day of the most recently ended Measurement
Period on or prior to the date of determination;

(32) Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of Indebtedness incurred pursuant to the first

paragraph of this covenant or clause (3) of this paragraph;

(33) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary incurred for local working capital purposes in an

aggregate amount outstanding not to exceed $150,000,000;

(34) Indebtedness of a Receivables Subsidiary pursuant to any Permitted Receivables Facility;

and

(35) Indebtedness of the Issuers and the Guarantors arising under a declaration of joint and

several liability used for the purpose of section 2:403 Dutch Civil Code (and any residual
liability under such declaration arising pursuant to section 2:404(2) Dutch Civil Code and
Indebtedness arising as a result of a fiscal unity (fiscale eenheid) of two entities for Dutch
tax purposes).

The Issuers will be entitled to divide and classify, and may from time to time redivide and
reclassify, an item of Indebtedness in more than one of the types of Indebtedness described in the first
paragraph and clauses (1) through (35) of the second paragraph above, as more fully set forth, and subject
to the limits described, under “—Certain Calculations.”

The accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the payment of interest in the form of
additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends on Disqualified Stock in the form of additional shares
of Disqualified Stock, accretion or amortization of original issue discount or liquidation preferences and
increases in the amount of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate
or currencies will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of this covenant. The
principal amount of any non-interest-bearing Indebtedness or other discount security constituting
Indebtedness at any date shall be the principal amount thereof that would be shown on a consolidated

75


-----

balance sheet of the Company dated such date prepared in accordance with GAAP. Guarantees of, or
obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments relating to, or
Liens securing, Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock that is otherwise included in the
determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock shall not be
included for purposes of this covenant.

Notwithstanding the above, if any Indebtedness is incurred as Permitted Refinancing
Indebtedness originally incurred pursuant to this covenant, and such Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness
would cause any applicable dollar-denominated or Adjusted EBITDA restriction described under this
“Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness” to be exceeded if calculated on the date of such Permitted
Refinancing Indebtedness, such dollar-denominated or Adjusted EBITDA restriction, as applicable, shall
be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Permitted Refinancing
Indebtedness is permitted to be incurred pursuant to the definition of “Permitted Refinancing
Indebtedness.”

If Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock originally incurred in reliance upon a
percentage of Adjusted EBITDA under this covenant is being refinanced and such refinancing would
cause the maximum amount of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock thereunder to be
exceeded at such time, then such refinancing will nevertheless be permitted thereunder and such
additional Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock will be deemed to have been incurred
under the applicable provision so long as the principal amount or liquidation preference of such
refinancing Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock does not exceed the principal amount or
liquidation preference of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock being refinanced, plus
additional Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock incurred to pay accrued but unpaid interest
or dividends, premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance costs, underwriting or initial purchaser
discounts, fees, costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) in
connection with such refinancing.

The principal amount or liquidation preference of any Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, if
incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock being
refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which
such respective Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock is denominated that is in effect on the
date of such refinancing.

In connection with the Company’s or a Restricted Subsidiary’s entry into an instrument
containing a binding commitment in respect of any revolving Indebtedness, the Company may elect to
treat all or any portion of such commitment (any such amount elected until revoked as described below,
an “Elected Amount”) under any Indebtedness which is to be incurred (or any commitment in respect
thereof) or secured by a Lien, as the case may be, as being incurred as of such election date, and: (i) any
subsequent incurrence of Indebtedness under such commitment (so long as the total amount under such
Indebtedness does not exceed the Elected Amount) shall not be deemed, for purposes of any calculation
under this Indenture, to be an incurrence of additional Indebtedness or an additional Lien at such
subsequent time and (ii) the Company may revoke an election of an Elected Amount at any time and,
thereafter, any future drawing on such revolving Indebtedness shall be deemed an incurrence of additional
Indebtedness.

If Indebtedness originally incurred in reliance upon the Consolidated Senior Secured First Lien
Debt Ratio or the Secured Net Leverage Ratio under clause (1) above is being Refinanced under such
clause (1) above and such Refinancing would cause the maximum amount of Indebtedness thereunder to
be exceeded at such time, then such Refinancing will nevertheless be permitted thereunder and such
Indebtedness will be deemed to have been incurred under such clause (1) so long as (x) the Liens securing

76


-----

such refinancing Indebtedness have a lien priority (without regard to control of remedies) equal or junior
to the Liens securing the Indebtedness being Refinanced and (y) the principal amount of such refinancing
Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of Indebtedness being Refinanced (plus unpaid
accrued interest and premium thereon, any committed or undrawn amounts and underwriting discounts,
fees, commissions and expenses associated with such refinancing Indebtedness).

The Indenture will not treat (1) unsecured Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to Secured
Indebtedness merely because it is unsecured or (2) Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to any other
Indebtedness merely because it has a junior priority with respect to the same collateral or because it is
secured by different collateral or issued or guaranteed by other obligors (or as a result of the control of
remedies).

**_Limitation on Liens_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any Co-Issuer or any Guarantor to, enter into, create,
incur or assume any Lien (except Permitted Liens) (the “Initial Lien”) on any property owned by any of
them, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, in order to secure any Indebtedness (other than
Indebtedness among the Issuers and the Guarantors), except, in the case of any property that does not
constitute Collateral, for any Initial Lien securing any Indebtedness if the Notes are secured equally and
ratably with (or prior to) the obligations so secured for so long as such obligations are so secured.

Any Lien created for the benefit of the holders of the Notes pursuant to the preceding sentence
shall provide by its terms that such Lien shall be automatically and unconditionally released and
discharged upon the release and discharge of the Initial Lien.

For purposes of the foregoing covenant, (A) a Lien securing an item of Indebtedness need not be
permitted solely by reference to one category of permitted Liens (or any portion thereof) described in the
definition of “Permitted Liens” but may be permitted in part under any combination thereof and (B) in the
event that a Lien meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Permitted Liens, the Company, in its
sole discretion, will classify, and may reclassify, such Lien and only be required to include the amount
and type of such Lien as a Permitted Lien, and a Lien may be divided and classified and reclassified into
more than one of such types of Liens. In addition, (1) for purposes of calculating compliance with the
foregoing covenant, in no event will the amount of any Indebtedness or Liens securing any Indebtedness
be required to be included more than once despite the fact more than one Person is or becomes liable with
respect to such Indebtedness and despite the fact such Indebtedness is secured by the property of more
than one Person (for example, and for avoidance of doubt, in the case where there are Liens on the
property of one or more of the Company and its Subsidiaries securing any Indebtedness, the amount of
such Indebtedness secured shall only be included once for purposes of such calculations) and (2) the
expansion of Liens by virtue of accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the payment of interest
or dividends in the form of additional Indebtedness, amortization of original issue discount and increases
in the amount of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of
currencies will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Liens for purposes of this covenant.

**_Asset Sales_**

The Indenture will provide that the Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries to, consummate an Asset Sale, unless:

(1) the Company or any such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration
(including, but not limited to, by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming
responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise, in connection with, such Asset
Sale) at the time of such Asset Sale at least equal to the fair market value (as determined in

77


-----

good faith by the Company at the time of contractually agreeing to such Asset Sale) of the
assets sold or otherwise disposed of; and

(2) except in the case of an Asset Swap, in the Company’s good faith determination, at least
75% of the consideration therefor, together with all other Asset Sales since the Issue Date
(on a cumulative basis), received by the Company or any such Restricted Subsidiary, as the
case may be, is in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents; provided that the amount of:

(a) any liabilities (as shown on the Company’s most recent consolidated balance sheet or
in the footnotes thereto, or if incurred or accrued subsequent to the date of such
balance sheet, such liabilities that would have been reflected on the Company’s
consolidated balance sheet or in the footnotes thereto if such incurrence or accrual had
taken place on or prior to the date of such balance sheet, as determined in good faith
by the Company) of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary (other than
contingent obligations and liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the Notes
or any Note Guarantee) that are assumed by the transferee of any such assets (or are
otherwise extinguished by the transferee in connection with the transactions relating to
such Asset Sale) or are acquired and extinguished by the Company or such Restricted
Subsidiary and, in each case, for which the Company and all such Restricted
Subsidiaries shall have no further obligation with respect thereto,

(b) any notes or other obligations or securities received by the Company or such
Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted by the Company or such
Restricted Subsidiary or reasonably expected by the Company acting in good faith to
be converted by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash
Equivalents, or by their terms are required to be satisfied for cash or Cash Equivalents
(to the extent of the cash or Cash Equivalents received), in each case, within 180 days
following the closing of such Asset Sale,

(c) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Company or such Restricted
Subsidiary in such Asset Sale having an aggregate fair market value (as determined in
good faith by the Company), taken together with all other Designated Non-Cash
Consideration received pursuant to this clause (c) that is at that time outstanding (but,
to the extent that any such Designated Non-Cash Consideration is sold or otherwise
liquidated for cash, minus the lesser of (a) the amount of the cash received (less the
cost of disposition, if any) and (b) the initial amount of such Designated Non-Cash
Consideration) not to exceed the greater of (x) $200,000,000 and (y) 12.5% of
Adjusted EBITDA (as determined at the time any such Asset Sale is made (calculated
on a Pro Forma Basis) as of the last day of the most recently ended Measurement
Period on or prior to the date of determination), with the fair market value (as
determined in good faith by the Company) of each item of Designated Non-Cash
Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to
subsequent changes in value, and

(d) any Capital Stock or assets described in clauses (2)(a) and (2)(d) of the next paragraph
of this covenant,

shall be deemed to be cash for purposes of this provision and for no other purpose.

Within 450 days after the receipt of any Net Proceeds of any Asset Sale, the Company or such
Restricted Subsidiary, at its option, may apply an amount equal to the Net Proceeds from such Asset Sale
(or, if the Company’s Secured Net Leverage Ratio is lower than or equal to 2.50:1.00 on a Pro Forma
Basis, 50% of such Net Proceeds),

78


-----

(1) to permanently reduce:

(a) Obligations under the Notes or any other Pari Passu Indebtedness (including
obligations under the Credit Facilities and the Existing Secured Notes) of any Issuer
or a Guarantor (and to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto, if
applicable); provided that if such Net Proceeds are applied to other Pari Passu
Indebtedness then the Issuers shall (i) equally and ratably reduce Obligations under
the Notes (x) as provided under “—Optional Redemption” or (y) through open market
purchases or (ii) make an offer (in accordance with the procedures set forth below for
an Asset Sale Offer (as defined below)) to all Holders of Notes to purchase their Notes
at 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus the amount of accrued but unpaid
interest, if any, on the principal amount of Notes that would otherwise be redeemed
under clause (i), or

(b) Indebtedness of a Non-Guarantor Subsidiary, other than Indebtedness owed to the
Company or another Restricted Subsidiary; or

(2) to (a) make an Investment in any one or more businesses; provided that such Investment in
any business is in the form of the acquisition of Capital Stock and results in the Company or
another of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be, owning an amount of the Capital
Stock of such business, such that it constitutes a Restricted Subsidiary, (b) acquire
properties (other than Capital Stock) or (c) make capital expenditures that, in the case of
each of (a), (b) and (c) are either (x) used or useful in a Related Business or (y) replace,
repair, improve or maintain assets to be used or useful in a Related Business (provided that
such assets or Capital Stock shall become Collateral (unless such assets or Capital Stock are
Excluded Assets or otherwise are not pledged to secure any other First-Priority Obligations)
under the Security Documents and in accordance with the Indenture substantially
simultaneously with such Investment or acquisition to the extent the assets disposed of
constituted Collateral); or

(3) any combination of the foregoing;

_provided that, in the case of clause (2) above, a binding commitment shall be treated as a permitted_
application of the Net Proceeds from the date of such commitment so long as the Company or such other
Restricted Subsidiary enters into such commitment with the good faith expectation that such Net Proceeds
will be applied to satisfy such commitment within 180 days of such commitment (an “Acceptable
_Commitment”); and provided_ _further that if any Acceptable Commitment is later cancelled or terminated_
for any reason before such Net Proceeds are applied, the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary enters
into another Acceptable Commitment (a “Second Commitment”) within 180 days of such cancellation or
termination; provided further that if any Second Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any
reason before such Net Proceeds are applied, then such Net Proceeds shall constitute Excess Proceeds.

Any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale that are not invested or applied as provided and within the
time period set forth in the preceding paragraph will be deemed to constitute “Excess Proceeds.” When
the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds $50.0 million, the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary shall make an offer to all Holders of the Notes and, if required by the terms of any Pari Passu
Indebtedness, to the holders of such Pari Passu Indebtedness (an “Asset Sale Offer”) to purchase the
maximum aggregate principal amount of Notes in minimum denominations of €100,000 and integral
multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof and such Pari Passu Indebtedness that may be purchased out of the
Excess Proceeds at an offer price in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof,
plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any (or, in respect of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, such lesser price,
if any, as may be provided for or permitted by the terms of such Pari Passu Indebtedness), to the date
fixed for the closing of such offer, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture.

79


-----

The Issuers will commence an Asset Sale Offer with respect to Excess Proceeds within fifteen
Business Days after the date that Excess Proceeds exceed $50.0 million by electronically delivering or
mailing the notice required pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, with a written copy to the Trustee. The
Issuers may satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to any Excess Proceeds by making an Asset
Sale Offer with respect to such Excess Proceeds prior to the time period that may be required by the
Indenture with respect to all or a part of the available Excess Proceeds (the “Advance Portion”) in
advance of being required to do so by the Indenture (an “Advance Offer”).

To the extent that the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of Notes and
such Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds
(or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Company and its Subsidiaries may use any
remaining Excess Proceeds (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) (the “Declined
_Amounts”) for any purpose, subject to the paragraph below and the other covenants contained in the_
Indenture. If the aggregate amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of Notes and the Pari Passu
Indebtedness surrendered in an Asset Sale Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds (or in the case of
an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Trustee shall select the Notes and the Issuers or the agent for
such Pari Passu Indebtedness shall select such Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased (a) if the Notes or
such Pari Passu Indebtedness are listed on any national securities exchange, in compliance with the
requirements of the principal national securities exchange on which the Notes or such Pari Passu
Indebtedness, as applicable, are listed, (b) on a pro rata basis based on the amount (determined as set forth
above) of the Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered or (c) by lot or such similar method in
accordance with the procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable; provided that no Notes
of €100,000 or less shall be repurchased in part. Upon completion of any such Asset Sale Offer (or
Advance Offer), the amount of Excess Proceeds (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance
Portion) shall be reset at zero.

An Asset Sale Offer or Advance Offer may be made at the same time as consents are solicited
with respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture, Notes and/or Note Guarantees (but
the Asset Sale Offer or Advance Offer may not condition tenders on the delivery of such consents).

Pending the final application of any Net Proceeds pursuant to this covenant, the holder of such
Net Proceeds may apply such Net Proceeds temporarily to reduce Indebtedness outstanding under a
revolving credit facility or otherwise use such Net Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the
Indenture.

The Issuers will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any
other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in
connection with the repurchase of the Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the
provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuers
will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached
their obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof.

**_Transactions with Affiliates_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, sell, lease or
otherwise transfer any property or assets to, or purchase, lease or otherwise acquire any property or assets
from, or otherwise engage in any other transactions with, any of its Affiliates involving aggregate
payments, for any such transaction or series of related transactions (each of the foregoing, an “Affiliate
_Transaction”), in excess of $15,000,000, unless:_

(1) such Affiliate Transactions are at prices and on terms and conditions, taken as a whole, not
materially less favorable to the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary than could be

80


-----

obtained on an arm’s-length basis from unrelated third parties or, if in the good faith
judgment of the Company no comparable transaction is available with which to compare
such transactions, such Affiliate Transactions are otherwise fair to the Company or such
Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view as determined by the Company in good
faith; or

(2) with respect to such Affiliate Transactions, the Company has obtained a letter from an
independent financial advisor stating that such transactions are fair from a financial point of
view.

The foregoing provisions will not apply to the following:

(a) transactions between or among the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries not involving
any other Affiliate;

(b) any Restricted Payment (including any transaction specifically excluded from the definition
of the term “Restricted Payments”) that is permitted under “—Limitation on Restricted
Payments” and any Permitted Investment;

(c) the payment of reasonable and customary fees and expenses, and the provision of
customary indemnification to directors, officers, employees, members of management and
consultants of the Company and the Subsidiaries;

(d) sales or issuances of Equity Interests to Affiliates of the Company which are otherwise
permitted or not restricted by the Indenture;

(e) loans and other transactions by and among the Company and/or the Subsidiaries to the
extent permitted under the covenants described in this “Description of Notes”;

(f) transactions with joint ventures for the purchase or sale of goods and services entered into
in the ordinary course of business;

(g) employment and severance arrangements (including options to purchase Equity Interests of
the Company, restricted stock plans, long-term incentive plans, stock appreciation rights
plans, participation plans or similar employee benefits plans) between the Company and any
Restricted Subsidiary and their directors, officers, employees, members of management and
consultants in the ordinary course of business;

(h) the existence of, and the performance of obligations of the Company or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries under the terms of, any agreement in existence or contemplated as of the Issue
Date, as these agreements may be amended, restated, amended and restated, supplemented,
extended, renewed or otherwise modified from time to time; provided, however, that any
future amendment, restatement, amendment and restatement, supplement, extension,
renewal or other modification entered into after the Issue Date will be permitted to the
extent that its terms are not more disadvantageous in any material respect, taken as a whole,
to the Holders than the terms of the agreements on the Issue Date;

(i) any agreement between any Person and an Affiliate of such Person existing at the time such
Person is acquired by or merged into the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries pursuant to
the terms of the Indenture; provided that such agreement was not entered into in
contemplation of such acquisition or merger, or any amendment thereto (so long as any
such amendment is not disadvantageous to the Holders in any material respect in the good

81


-----

faith judgment of the Company when taken as a whole as compared to such agreement as in
effect on the date of such acquisition or merger);

(j) payments to or from, and transactions with, joint ventures (to the extent any such joint
venture is only an Affiliate as a result of Investments by the Company and its Restricted
Subsidiaries in such joint venture), non-Wholly Owned Subsidiaries and Unrestricted
Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business to the extent otherwise permitted under the
definition of “Permitted Investments”;

(k) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers or purchasers or sellers of goods or services,
or transactions otherwise relating to the purchase or sale of goods or services, in each case
in the ordinary course of business and otherwise in compliance with the terms of the
Indenture, which are fair to the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, in the reasonable
determination of the board of directors of the Company, or are on terms at least as
favorable, in all material respects, as might reasonably have been obtained at such time
from an unaffiliated party;

(l) the entering into of any Tax sharing agreement or arrangement to the extent payments under
such agreement or arrangement would otherwise be permitted under the covenant described
under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

(m) any contribution to the capital of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries;

(n) the formation and maintenance of any consolidated group or subgroup for Tax, accounting
or cash pooling or management purposes in the ordinary course of business;

(o) transactions undertaken in good faith (as certified by a Responsible Officer of the
Company) for the purpose of improving the consolidated Tax efficiency of the Company
and its Subsidiaries and not for the purpose of circumventing any covenant set forth in the
Indenture;

(p) any other transaction with an Affiliate, which is approved by a majority of disinterested
members of the board of directors (or equivalent governing body) of the Company in good
faith; and

(q) (i) investments by any Affiliate in securities of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary
(and payment of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such Affiliate in connection
therewith) so long as the investment is being offered by the Company or such Restricted
Subsidiary generally to other investors on the same or more favorable terms, and (ii)
payments to such Affiliates in respect of securities of the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary contemplated in the foregoing subclause (i) or that were acquired from Persons
other than the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, in each case, in accordance with the
terms of such securities.

If the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (i) purchases or otherwise acquires assets or
properties from a Person which is not an Affiliate, the purchase or acquisition by an Affiliate of the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of an interest in all or a portion of the assets or properties acquired
shall not be deemed an Affiliate Transaction (or cause such purchase or acquisition by the Company or a
Restricted Subsidiary to be deemed an Affiliate Transaction) or (ii) sells or otherwise disposes of assets or
other properties to a Person who is not an Affiliate, the sale or other disposition by an Affiliate of the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of an interest in all or a portion of the assets or properties sold

82


-----

shall not be deemed an Affiliate Transaction (or cause such sale or other disposition by the Company or a
Restricted Subsidiary to be deemed an Affiliate Transaction).

**_Consolidation, Merger and Conveyance, Transfer and Lease of Assets_**

(A) The Company may not: (1) consolidate or merge with or into another Person (whether or not
the Company is the surviving entity); or (2) sell, assign, transfer, convey, lease or otherwise dispose of all
or substantially all of the properties or assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, in one or more related transactions, to another Person, unless:

(1) either: (a) the Company is the surviving entity in such consolidation or merger; or (b) the
Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than the
Company) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance, lease or other
disposition has been made is an entity organized or existing under the laws of any state of
the United States or the District of Columbia (the Company or such Person, including the
Person to which such sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance, lease or other disposition has
been made, as the case may be, being herein called the “Successor Company”); provided
that at any time neither the Successor Company nor any other Issuer is a corporation, there
shall be a co-issuer of the Notes that is a corporation that satisfies the requirements of this
covenant;

(2) the Successor Company (if other than the Company) assumes all the obligations of the
Company under the Notes, the Indenture and the Security Documents pursuant to a
supplemental indenture;

(3) immediately after such transaction, no Default or Event of Default exists;

(4) (a) the Company (or its Successor Company, as applicable), on a Pro Forma Basis, would
be permitted to incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the Total Net
Leverage Ratio test set forth in the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—
Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness” or (b) the Total Net Leverage Ratio for the
Company (or the Successor Company, as applicable) and its Restricted Subsidiaries would
be less than or equal to such ratio for the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries
immediately prior to such transaction; and

(5) in any transaction in which the Company is not the Successor Company, the Issuers or the
Successor Company delivers to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of
Counsel each stating that such transaction complies with the “—Consolidation, Merger and
Conveyance, Transfer and Lease of Assets” section of the Indenture and, if applicable, all
conditions precedent in the Indenture to the execution of the supplemental indenture have
been satisfied, and, with respect to the Opinion of Counsel, that such supplemental
indenture is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Successor Company.

(B) Neither Co-Issuer may consolidate or merge with or into another Person (whether or not such
Co-Issuer is the surviving entity), unless:

(1) either: (a) such Co-Issuer is the surviving entity in such consolidation or merger; or (b) the
Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than such CoIssuer) is an entity organized or existing under the laws of any state of the United States or
the District of Columbia (such Co-Issuer or such Person, including the Person to which such
sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance, lease or other disposition has been made, as the case
may be, being herein called the “Co-Issuer Successor Company”); provided that at any time
neither the Co-Issuer Successor Company nor any other Issuer is a corporation, there shall

83


-----

be a co-issuer of the Notes that is a corporation that satisfies the requirements of this
covenant;

(2) the Co-Issuer Successor Company (if other than such Co-Issuer) assumes all the obligations
of such Co-Issuer under the Notes, the Indenture and the Security Documents pursuant to a
supplemental indenture;

(3) immediately after such transaction, no Default or Event of Default exists; and

(4) in any transaction in which such Co-Issuer is not the Co-Issuer Successor Company, such
Co-Issuer or the Co-Issuer Successor Company delivers to the Trustee an Officer’s
Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel each stating that such transaction complies with the
“—Consolidation, Merger and Conveyance, Transfer and Lease of Assets” section of the
Indenture and, if applicable, all conditions precedent in the Indenture to the execution of the
supplemental indenture have been satisfied, and, with respect to the Opinion of Counsel,
that such supplemental indenture is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Co-Issuer
Successor Company.

The Indenture will also provide for similar provisions relating to any consolidation, merger or
sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance, lease or other disposition of all or substantially all of the
properties or assets of a Guarantor; provided that such provisions shall not apply to a transaction pursuant
to which such Guarantor shall be released from its obligations under the Indenture, the Security
Documents and the Notes in accordance with the covenant described under “—Guarantees.”

For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer or other
disposition of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Restricted Subsidiaries of
the Company, which properties and assets, if held by the Company instead of such Restricted
Subsidiaries, would constitute all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Company on a
consolidated basis, shall be deemed to be the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer or other
disposition of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Company.

The predecessor company will be released from its obligations under the Indenture and, upon the
execution and delivery of the supplemental indenture referred to above, the Successor Company or the
Co-Issuer Successor Company, as applicable, will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise
every right and power of, the Company or the Co-Issuers, as applicable, under the Indenture and the
Security Documents, but, in the case of a lease of all or substantially all its assets, the predecessor will not
be so released.

Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no
precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances
there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve “all or
substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, clauses (A)(3), (A)(4) and (B)(3) above will not apply to (a) a
sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance, lease or other disposition of assets between or among the
Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries (including the Co-Issuers), (b) any Restricted Subsidiary
consolidating with, merging into or selling, assigning, transferring, conveying, leasing or otherwise
disposing of all or part of its properties and assets to the Company or to another Restricted Subsidiary
(including the Co-Issuers) (provided that, in the event that such Restricted Subsidiary is a Co-Issuer or a
Guarantor, it may consolidate with, merge into or sell, assign, transfer, convey, lease or otherwise dispose
of all or part of its properties and assets solely to another Issuer or another Guarantor) or (c) any Issuer or
a Guarantor merging with an Affiliate solely for the purpose and with the sole effect of reorganizing such
Issuer or such Guarantor in another jurisdiction.

84


-----

The obligations of a Co-Issuer under the Indenture will be automatically and unconditionally
released without any further action by any Person:

(a) in the event that there is a sale, disposition or other transfer (including through merger
or consolidation) of all of the Capital Stock (or any sale, disposition or other transfer
of Capital Stock (including through merger or consolidation) following which the
applicable Co-Issuer is no longer a Subsidiary, including by way of a dividend of the
Capital Stock of such Co-Issuer to the stockholders of the Company), or all or
substantially all the assets, of the applicable Co-Issuer to a Person that is not a
Subsidiary of the Company where such sale, disposition or other transfer is not
prohibited by the Indenture; or

(b) if the Issuers exercise their legal defeasance option or their covenant defeasance
option as described under “—Defeasance” or if their obligations under the Indenture
are discharged in accordance with the terms of the Indenture as described under “—
Satisfaction and Discharge.”

In addition, the obligations of a Co-Issuer under the Indenture may, at the sole discretion of the
Company upon written notice to the Trustee, be unconditionally released without any further action by
any other Person, upon the release or discharge of the Guarantee by such Co-Issuer of Indebtedness under
the Credit Agreement except a discharge or release by or as a result of payment under such Guarantee (it
being understood that a release subject to a contingent reinstatement is still a release, and that if any such
Guarantee is so reinstated, such Co-Issuer’s obligations under the Indenture shall also be reinstated to the
extent that such Subsidiary would then be required to provide a Note Guarantee pursuant to the covenant
described under “—Additional Guarantees”); provided that the Guarantees by such Co-Issuer of the
Existing Notes are also released at or prior to such time.

**_Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries_**

The Board of Directors of the Company may designate any Restricted Subsidiary (other than a
Co-Issuer) of the Company to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary; provided that:

(1) any Guarantee by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary thereof of any Indebtedness of
the Subsidiary being so designated will be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness by
the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary (or both, if applicable) at the time of such
designation, and such incurrence of Indebtedness would be permitted under the covenant
described above under the caption “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness”;

(2) the aggregate value (as determined in accordance with the Indenture) of all outstanding
Investments owned by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary being
so designated (including any Guarantee by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary
thereof of any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary) will be deemed to be an Investment made
as of the time of such designation and that such Investment would be permitted under the
covenant described above under the caption “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

(3) the Subsidiary being so designated has not Guaranteed or otherwise directly or indirectly
provided credit support for any Indebtedness of the Company or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries, except (i) to the extent such Guarantee or credit support would be released
upon such designation or (ii) a pledge of the Equity Interests of the Unrestricted Subsidiary
that is the obligor thereunder; and

(4) no Default or Event of Default would be in existence following such designation.

85


-----

Any designation of a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be
evidenced to the Trustee by delivering to the Trustee the Board Resolution giving effect to such
designation and an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such designation complied with the preceding
conditions and was permitted by the Indenture. If, at any time, any Unrestricted Subsidiary would fail to
meet any of the preceding requirements described in clause (3) above, it will thereafter cease to be an
Unrestricted Subsidiary for purposes of the Indenture and any Indebtedness, Investments or Liens on the
property of such Subsidiary will be deemed to be incurred or made by a Restricted Subsidiary of the
Company as of such date and, if such Indebtedness, Investments or Liens are not permitted to be incurred
or made as of such date under the Indenture, the Issuers will be in default under the Indenture.

The Board of Directors of the Company may at any time designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to
be a Restricted Subsidiary; provided that:

(1) such designation will be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted
Subsidiary of the Company of any outstanding Indebtedness (including any Obligations that
are non-recourse) of such Unrestricted Subsidiary and such designation will only be
permitted if such Indebtedness is permitted under the covenant described under the caption
“—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness”; and

(2) no Default or Event of Default would be in existence following such designation.

**_Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries to, directly or
indirectly, create or otherwise cause or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual
restriction on the ability of any such Non-Guarantor Subsidiary to:

(1) (a)  pay dividends or make any other distributions to any Issuer or any Guarantors on its
Capital Stock or with respect to any other interest or participation in, or measured by, its
profits, or

(b) pay any Indebtedness owed to any Issuer or any Guarantor;

(2) make loans or advances to any Issuer or any Guarantor; or

(3) sell, lease or transfer any of its properties or assets to any Issuer or any Guarantor, except
(in each case) for such encumbrances or restrictions existing under or by reason of:

(a) contractual encumbrances or restrictions (i) in effect on the Issue Date, or (ii) pursuant
to the Credit Facilities and the related documentation and related Hedging
Obligations;

(b) (i) the Indenture, the Notes and the Note Guarantees, (ii) the indentures governing the
Existing Notes, the Existing Notes and the guarantees thereof, including any future
guarantees, (iii) the Security Documents and (iv) any agreement governing
Indebtedness permitted to be incurred pursuant to the covenant described under “—
Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness”; provided that the provisions relating to
restrictions of the type described in clauses (1) through (3) above contained in such
agreement, taken as a whole, (i) are not materially more restrictive, taken as a whole,
as determined in good faith by the Company, than the provisions contained in the
Credit Facilities, the Security Documents (including, for the avoidance of doubt, in
each case any amendments, supplements, modifications, restatements or refinancings
thereof), or in the Indenture or in the indentures governing the Existing Notes, as

86


-----

applicable, in each case as in effect when initially executed or (ii) will not, in the good
faith judgment of the Company, affect the ability of the Issuers to make anticipated
payments of principal, premium, if any, interest or any other payments on the Notes;

(c) purchase money obligations and Capital Lease Obligations that impose restrictions of
the nature discussed in clause (3) above on the property so acquired or leased;

(d) applicable law or any applicable rule, regulation, license, permit or order;

(e) (i) in the case of the redesignation of an Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted
Subsidiary or the merger, amalgamation or consolidation of an Unrestricted
Subsidiary into the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary or the transfer of all or
substantially all of the assets of an Unrestricted Subsidiary to the Company or a
Restricted Subsidiary, any agreement or other instrument of such Unrestricted
Subsidiary (but, in any such case, not created in contemplation thereof) and (ii) any
agreement or other instrument of a Person acquired by or merged or consolidated with
or into the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (including the acquisition of
a minority interest of such Person) in existence at the time of such transaction (but not
created in contemplation thereof), which encumbrance or restriction is not applicable
to any Person, or the properties or assets of any Person, other than the Person and its
Subsidiaries, or the property or assets of the Person and its Subsidiaries, so acquired;

(f) contracts for the direct or indirect sale or disposition of assets (including agreements
in connection with a sale and leaseback transaction or merger), including customary
restrictions with respect to a Subsidiary of the Company pursuant to an agreement that
has been entered into for the direct or indirect sale or disposition of any of the Capital
Stock or assets of such Subsidiary;

(g) Secured Indebtedness otherwise permitted to be incurred pursuant to the covenants
described under “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness” and “—Limitation on
Liens” that limit the right of the debtor to dispose of the assets securing such
Indebtedness;

(h) restrictions on cash, Cash Equivalents or other deposits or net worth imposed by
suppliers, customers or landlords under contracts entered into in the ordinary course of
business or arising in connection with any Permitted Liens;

(i) other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock of Non-Guarantor
Subsidiaries permitted to be incurred subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the
provisions of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Incurrence of
Indebtedness”;

(j) customary provisions in joint venture agreements or arrangements and other similar
agreements or arrangements relating solely to such joint venture or other
arrangements;

(k) customary provisions contained in leases, sub-leases, licenses or sub-licenses and
other agreements, including with respect to intellectual property, in each case, entered
into in the ordinary course of business or as is typical in the same or similar industries
or that in the judgment of the Company would not materially impair the Issuers’
ability to make payments under the Notes when due;

87


-----

(l) restrictions in agreements or instruments that prohibit the payment or making of
dividends other than on a pro rata basis;

(m) provisions restricting assignment of any agreement entered into in the ordinary course

of business;

(n) customary provisions restricting subletting or assignment of any lease governing a
leasehold interest of any Restricted Subsidiary or the assignment of any license or
sub-license agreement;

(o) restrictions or conditions contained in any trading, netting, operating, construction,
service, supply, purchase, sale or other agreement to which the Company or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries is a party entered into in the ordinary course of business;
provided that such agreement prohibits the encumbrance of solely the property or
assets of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary that are the subject to such
agreement, the payment rights arising thereunder or the proceeds thereof and does not
extend to any other asset or property of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary or
the assets or property of another Restricted Subsidiary; and

(p) any encumbrances or restrictions of the type referred to in clauses (1), (2) and (3)
above imposed by any amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases,
supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings of the contracts, instruments or
obligations referred to in clauses (a) through (p) above; provided that such
amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements,
refundings, replacements or refinancings are, in the good faith judgment of the
Company, no more restrictive in any material respect with respect to such
encumbrance and other restrictions taken as a whole than those prior to such
amendment, modification, restatement, renewal, increase, supplement, refunding,
replacement or refinancing.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, (1) the priority of any Preferred
Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior to dividends or liquidating distributions
being paid on common equity shall not be deemed a restriction on the ability to make distributions on
Capital Stock and (2) the subordination of (including the application of any standstill requirements to)
loans and advances made to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness incurred by the
Company or such Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed a restriction on the ability to make loans or
advances.

**_Additional Guarantees_**

If the Company or any Wholly Owned Domestic Subsidiary acquires or creates another Wholly
Owned Domestic Subsidiary (other than an Excluded Subsidiary) after the Issue Date that provides a
Guarantee of the Issuers’ or any Guarantor’s obligations, or any Wholly Owned Domestic Subsidiary
(other than an Excluded Subsidiary) becomes an obligor, under any Material Indebtedness, then, within
30 days after such Wholly Owned Domestic Subsidiary provides such Guarantee or becomes such an
obligor, such Wholly Owned Domestic Subsidiary will execute a supplemental indenture to the Indenture
providing for a Note Guarantee by such Wholly Owned Domestic Subsidiary and deliver such Security
Documents or supplements thereto as may be necessary to provide a Lien on all of such Guarantor’s
assets (other than Excluded Assets); provided that any extensions of time or waivers as are granted by the
administrative agent under the Credit Agreement for the comparable requirement under the Credit
Agreement or any related loan document shall automatically be granted under the Indenture and the
Security Documents. The Company may elect, in its sole discretion, to cause any Subsidiary that is not

88


-----

otherwise required to provide a Note Guarantee to become a Guarantor, in which case such Subsidiary
shall not be required to comply with the 30-day period described above.

**Provision of Financial Information**

The Company will provide to the Trustee, within 30 days after the Company files the same with
the Commission, copies of the annual reports and of the information, documents and other reports (or
copies of such portions of any of the foregoing as the Commission may from time to time by rules and
regulations prescribe) which the Company may be required to file with the Commission pursuant to
Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act or, if the Company is not required to file information,
documents or reports pursuant to either of such Sections, then to provide to the Trustee and the holders of
the Notes:

(1) within 90 days after the end of each fiscal year of the Company, its audited consolidated
balance sheet and related statements of operations, stockholders’ equity and cash flows as
of the end of and for such year, setting forth in each case in comparative form the figures
for the previous fiscal year, all reported on by independent public accountants of recognized
national standing to the effect that such consolidated financial statements present fairly in
all material respects the financial condition and results of operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP; and

(2) within 45 days after the end of each fiscal quarter of the Company not corresponding with
the fiscal year-end, its unaudited consolidated balance sheet and related statements of
operations, stockholders’ equity and cash flows as of the end of and for such fiscal quarter
and the then elapsed portion of the fiscal year, setting forth in each case in comparative
form the figures for the corresponding period or periods of (or, in the case of the balance
sheet, as of the end of) the previous fiscal year, all certified by its chief financial officer as
presenting fairly in all material respects the financial condition and results of operations of
the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis in accordance with
GAAP, subject to normal year-end audit adjustments and the absence of footnotes, and
accompanied by a statement by the directors of the Company commenting on the
performance of the Company and its subsidiaries for the quarter to which the financial
statements relate and any material developments or proposals affecting the Company or
business.

The requirement for the Company to provide information may be satisfied by filing of such
reports, documents and information via the Commission’s EDGAR system (or any successor electronic
filing system) or posting such reports, documents and information on its website, in each case within the
time periods specified herein, it being understood that the Trustee shall have no responsibility whatsoever
to determine if such filings have been made, and that delivery of such reports, information and documents
to the Trustee is for informational purposes only and the Trustee’s receipt of such shall not constitute
constructive notice of any information contained therein or determinable from information contained
therein, including the Company’s compliance with any of its covenants hereunder (as to which the
Trustee is entitled to rely exclusively on Officer’s Certificates). To the extent any information is not
provided within the time periods specified in the immediately preceding paragraph and such information
is subsequently provided, the Company will be deemed to have satisfied its obligations with respect
thereto at such time and any default or event of default with respect thereto shall be deemed to have been
cured.

At any time when the Notes are “restricted securities” under Rule 144 under the Securities Act,
the Company will furnish to the holders of the Notes and prospective investors, upon their request, the
information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act.

**Covenant Suspension When Notes Obtain Investment Grade Rating**

Beginning on the day of a Covenant Suspension Event (as defined below) and ending on a
Reversion Date (as defined below) (such period, a “Suspension Period”) with respect to the Notes, the
covenants specifically listed under the following captions in this “Description of Notes” will not be
applicable to the Notes (collectively, the “Suspended Covenants”):

(1) “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

(2) “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness”;

(3) clause (4) of the first paragraph of “—Certain Covenants—Consolidation, Merger and
Conveyance, Transfer and Lease of Assets”;

(4) “—Certain Covenants—Asset Sales”;

(5) “—Certain Covenants—Transactions with Affiliates”;

(6) “—Certain Covenants—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted
Subsidiaries”; and

(7) “—Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees” (but only with respect to any Person that is
required to become a Guarantor after the date of the commencement of the applicable
Suspension Period).

On each Reversion Date, (i) all Indebtedness Incurred, or Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock
issued, during the Suspension Period (or deemed incurred or issued in connection with a Limited
Condition Transaction entered into during the Suspension Period) will be deemed to have been
outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (3) of the second paragraph
under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness”; (ii) any Affiliate Transaction
entered into after such reinstatement pursuant to an agreement entered into during any Suspension Period
shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (h) of the second paragraph of the covenant described
under “—Certain Covenants—Transactions with Affiliates”; (iii) any encumbrance or restriction on the
ability of any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor to take any action described in clauses
(1) through (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Dividend
and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries” that becomes effective during any
Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (a)(i) of the second paragraph of
the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions
Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries”; (iv) no Subsidiary of the Company shall be required to comply with
the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees” after such reinstatement
with respect to any Guarantee or obligation entered into by such Subsidiary during any Suspension
Period; and (v) all Investments made during the Suspension Period (or deemed made in connection with a
Limited Condition Transaction entered into during the Suspension Period) will be classified to have been
made under clause (b)(i) of the definition of “Permitted Investments.”

Calculations made after the Reversion Date of the amount available to be made as Restricted
Payments under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments” will be made as though the
covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments” had been in effect
since the Issue Date and prior, but not during, the Suspension Period (including with respect to a Limited
Condition Transaction entered into during the Suspension Period). Accordingly, Restricted Payments
made during the Suspension Period will not reduce the amount available to be made as Restricted
Payments under the first paragraph of “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments.”

90


-----

As described above, (i) no Default or Event of Default will be deemed to have occurred on the
Reversion Date as a result of any actions taken by the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries during the
Suspension Period that were permitted at such time and none of the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall bear any liability for any actions taken or events occurring during the Suspension Period, or any
actions taken at any time pursuant to any contractual obligation arising during any Suspension Period, in
each case as a result of a failure to comply with the Suspended Covenants during the Suspension Period
(or, upon termination of the Suspension Period or after that time based solely on any action taken or event
that occurred during the Suspension Period), and (ii) following a Reversion Date, the Company and each
Restricted Subsidiary will be permitted, without causing a Default or Event of Default, to honor, comply
with or otherwise perform any contractual commitments or obligations entered into or arising during any
Suspension Period and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby, including any payments
thereunder.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, during the Suspension Period the Company shall not designate
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to be Unrestricted Subsidiaries unless the Company would have been
permitted to designate such Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary if a Suspension Period had not been
in effect for any period, and, following the Reversion Date, such designation shall be deemed to have
created an Investment or Restricted Payment pursuant to the last paragraph of the covenant described
under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments” at the time of such designation.

For purposes of the “—Certain Covenants—Asset Sales” covenant, on the Reversion Date, the
unutilized Excess Proceeds amount will be reset to zero.

The Note Guarantees will be suspended during the Suspension Period. In addition, immediately
upon the commencement of the Suspension Period and without further action of any Person, the security
interests of the Collateral Agent and the other secured parties in the Collateral shall be terminated and
released. During the Suspension Period, the Collateral Agent shall execute and deliver, at the Company’s
expense, all documents or other instruments that the Company shall reasonably request to evidence the
termination and release of such security interests and shall return all Collateral in their possession to the
applicable Issuer or Guarantor. During any Suspension Period, the Issuers and the Guarantors shall not be
required to comply with the Security Documents.

On the Reversion Date, the security interests of the Collateral Agent and the other secured parties
in the Collateral shall, without any further action on the part of the Collateral Agent and the other secured
parties, be reinstated and the provisions of the immediately preceding paragraph shall no longer apply
(until the commencement of a subsequent Suspension Period). Promptly following the Reversion Date,
the Issuers and the Guarantors shall execute any and all documents, financing statements, agreements and
instruments, and take all such actions (including the filing and recording of financing statements and other
documents) that may be required under applicable law or that the Collateral Agent shall reasonably
request, to reinstate such security interests (all at the expense of the Issuers and the Guarantors),
including with respect to any Subsidiaries or assets that would have been subjected to the covenant
described under “—Security—After-Acquired Property” had such terminated Suspension Period not been
in effect; provided that all such actions shall be completed no later than sixty (60) days after the date of
termination of such Suspension Period (or such later date as the Collateral Agent shall deem appropriate).

Any period of time that (i) the Notes have Investment Grade Ratings from at least two of
Moody’s, S&P and Fitch and (ii) no Default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture is referred
to as a “Covenant Suspension Event.” If on any subsequent date (the “Reversion Date”) any of Moody’s,
S&P and Fitch withdraws its Investment Grade Rating or downgrades the rating assigned to the Notes
below an Investment Grade Rating (in each case, to the extent any such rating agency has given an
Investment Grade Rating) the result of which is that the Notes cease to have an Investment Grade Rating

91


-----

from at least two of Moody’s, S&P and Fitch, then the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries will
thereafter again be subject to the Suspended Covenants with respect to future events.

The Issuers shall deliver promptly to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate notifying it of the
occurrence of any Covenant Suspension Event or Reversion Date; provided, however, that the Trustee
shall have no obligation to ascertain or verify the occurrence of any Covenant Suspension Event or
Reversion Date.

There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain Investment Grade Ratings.

**Certain Calculations**

For purposes of determining compliance at any time with the covenants described under “—
Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness,” “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
Restricted Payments,” “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens,” “—Certain Covenants—
Consolidation, Merger and Conveyance, Transfer and Lease of Assets,” “—Certain Covenants—Asset
Sales” and “—Certain Covenants—Transactions with Affiliates,” in the event that any Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock, Preferred Stock, Lien, Restricted Payment, Permitted Investment, Disposition or
Affiliate Transaction, as applicable, meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of transactions or
items permitted pursuant to any clause of, or exception from, such covenants, the Company, in its sole
discretion, from time to time, may classify or reclassify such transaction or item (or portion thereof) and
will only be required to include the amount and type of such transaction (or portion thereof) in any one
category; provided that Indebtedness under the Credit Agreement outstanding on the Issue Date shall at
all times be classified as incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph of the covenant described
under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness.” For purposes of determining
the permissibility of any action, change, transaction or event that by the terms of the Indenture requires a
calculation of any financial ratio or test (including the Consolidated Senior Secured First Lien Debt Ratio,
the Total Net Leverage Ratio or the Secured Net Leverage Ratio), such financial ratio or test shall, except
as expressly permitted under the Indenture, be calculated at the time such action is taken, such change is
made, such transaction is consummated or such event occurs, as the case may be, and no default or Event
of Default shall be deemed to have occurred solely as a result of a change in such financial ratio or test
occurring after the time such action is taken, such change is made, such transaction is consummated or
such event occurs, as the case may be. It is understood and agreed that any Indebtedness, Disqualified
Stock, Preferred Stock, Lien, Restricted Payment, Disposition or Affiliate Transaction need not be
permitted solely by reference to one category of permitted Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock, Preferred
Stock, Liens, Restricted Payments, Permitted Investment, Dispositions or Affiliate Transactions,
respectively, but may instead be permitted in part under any combination thereof (it being understood that
compliance with each such covenant is separately required).

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) when calculating the availability under any
basket, financial ratio or test (including any Consolidated Senior Secured First Lien Debt Ratio test, any
Secured Net Leverage Ratio test, any Total Net Leverage Ratio test or the amount of Consolidated Net
Income or Adjusted EBITDA) in connection with the incurrence of Indebtedness, the issuance of
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, the creation of Liens, the making of any Disposition, the making of
an Investment, the making of a Restricted Payment or the designation of any Restricted Subsidiaries or
Unrestricted Subsidiaries, (ii) determining compliance with any provision of the Indenture which requires
that no default or Event of Default (or any type of default or Event of Default) has occurred, is continuing
or would result therefrom or (iii) determining the satisfaction of all other conditions precedent to the
incurrence of Indebtedness, the issuance of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, the creation of Liens,
the making of any Disposition, the making of an Investment, the making of a Restricted Payment or the
designation of any Restricted Subsidiaries or Unrestricted Subsidiaries, in each case in connection with a
Limited Condition Transaction and any actions or transactions related thereto, the date of determination

92


-----

of such ratio or other provisions, determination of whether any default or Event of Default has occurred,
is continuing or would result therefrom, determination of compliance with any representations or
warranties or the satisfaction of any other conditions shall, at the option of the Company (the Company’s
election to exercise such option in connection with any Limited Condition Transaction, an “LCT
_Election,” which LCT Election may be in respect of one or more of clauses (i), (ii) or (iii)) be deemed to_
be the date the definitive agreements or other relevant definitive documentation (or, if applicable, the date
of delivery of a notice, declaration or making of a Restricted Payment or similar event) for such Limited
Condition Transaction are entered into (the “LCT Test Date”). If on a Pro Forma Basis after giving effect
to such Limited Condition Transaction and the other transactions to be entered into in connection
therewith (including any incurrence or issuance of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock,
and the use of proceeds thereof), with such ratios, tests, baskets and other provisions calculated as if such
Limited Condition Transaction or other transactions had occurred at the beginning of the most recent
Measurement Period ending prior to the LCT Test Date for which financial statements have been (or are
required to be) delivered pursuant to “—Provision of Financial Information,” the Company could have
taken such action on the relevant LCT Test Date in compliance with the applicable ratios, tests, baskets or
other provisions, such provisions shall be deemed to have been complied with, unless an Event of Default
pursuant to clause (1) or (2) of the first paragraph under “—Events of Default,” or, solely with respect to
the Company, clause (5) of the first paragraph under “—Events of Default,” shall be continuing on the
date such Limited Condition Transaction is consummated; provided that if financial statements for one or
more subsequent fiscal quarters shall have become available, the Company may elect, in its sole
discretion, to re-determine all such ratios, tests, baskets or other provisions on the basis of such financial
statements, in which case, such date of redetermination shall thereafter be deemed to be the applicable
LCT Test Date for purposes of such ratios, tests, baskets or such other provisions. For the avoidance of
doubt, (i) if, following the LCT Test Date, any of such ratios, tests, baskets or other provisions are
exceeded or breached as a result of fluctuations in such ratio, test or basket (including due to fluctuations
in Adjusted EBITDA or other components of such ratio, test or basket) or other provisions at or prior to
the consummation of the relevant Limited Condition Transactions, such ratios, tests, baskets and other
provisions will not be deemed to have been exceeded or failed to have been satisfied as a result of such
fluctuations solely for purposes of determining whether the Limited Condition Transaction is permitted
hereunder; provided that if such ratios, tests or baskets improve as a result of such fluctuations, such
improved ratios, tests and/or baskets may be utilized, and (ii) such ratios and compliance with such
conditions shall not be tested at the time of consummation of such Limited Condition Transaction or
related Specified Transactions, unless, other than if an Event of Default pursuant to clause (1) or (2) of the
first paragraph under “—Events of Default,” or, solely with respect to the Company, clause (5) of the first
paragraph under “—Events of Default,” shall be continuing on such date, the Company elects, in its sole
discretion, to test such ratios and compliance with such conditions on the date such Limited Condition
Transaction or related Specified Transactions are consummated. If the Company has made an LCT

that would be unrestricted but for Liens thereon pursuant to a Permitted Lien) as determined in
accordance with GAAP, to (b) Adjusted EBITDA of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the relevant
Measurement Period.

For purposes of this definition, (x) Consolidated Senior Secured First Lien Debt Ratio, Adjusted
EBITDA and Consolidated EBITDA shall be calculated after giving effect on a Pro Forma Basis for the
applicable Measurement Period to any Specified Transactions that have occurred during such

any such transaction; provided that the Company shall not be required to give Pro Forma Effect to any
transaction that it does not in good faith deem material. If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of
interest and is being given Pro Forma Effect, the interest on such Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the
rate in effect on the date such calculation is being made had been the applicable rate for the entire period
(taking into account any Hedging Obligations applicable to such Indebtedness). Interest on obligations
with respect to Capital Leases shall be deemed to accrue at an interest rate determined in good faith by a
responsible financial or accounting officer of the Company to be the rate of interest implicit in such
Capital Lease in accordance with GAAP. Interest on Indebtedness that may optionally be determined at
an interest rate based upon a factor of a prime or similar rate, a eurocurrency rate, or other rate, shall be
deemed to have been based upon the rate actually chosen, or, if none, then based upon such optional rate
chosen as the Company may designate.

With respect to any transaction that requires the calculation of Consolidated Senior Secured First
Lien Debt Ratio, Adjusted EBITDA or Consolidated EBITDA, the Company may, at its option, use the
date that the definitive agreement (or other relevant definitive documentation) for such transaction is
entered into (the “Agreement Date”) as the applicable date of determination of such calculations, in each
case with such pro forma adjustments as are appropriate and consistent with the provisions set forth in the
above paragraphs to this definition. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Company elects to use the
Agreement Date as the applicable date of determination in accordance with the foregoing, any fluctuation
or change in the applicable ratio, Adjusted EBITDA or Consolidated EBITDA of the Company or its
Restricted Subsidiaries occurring at or prior to the consummation of the relevant transaction will not be
taken into account for purposes of determining compliance of the transaction with the Indenture.

128


-----

disaffirms its obligations under the Indenture, the Security Documents or any Note
Guarantee, other than by reason of the release of such Guarantee in accordance with the
terms of the Indenture; or

(7) (a) the Liens created by the Security Documents securing the Notes or Note Guarantees

intended to be covered thereby (to the extent perfection is required by the Indenture or such
Security Documents) other than in accordance with the terms of such relevant Security

(c) the enforceability thereof shall be contested by the Issuers or any Guarantor.

If an Event of Default under the Indenture (other than an Event of Default specified in clause (5)
above with respect to the Company) shall occur and be continuing, the Trustee or the holders of at least
25% in principal amount of outstanding Notes under the Indenture may declare the principal of, premium,
if any, and accrued interest on the Notes to be immediately due and payable by notice in writing to the
Issuers and the Trustee (if given by the holders) specifying the respective Event of Default and that it is a
“notice of acceleration” (the “Acceleration Notice”), and the same shall become immediately due and
payable.

Any notice of Default, Acceleration Notice or instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of
Default, Acceleration Notice or take any other action (a “Noteholder Direction”) provided by any one or
more Holders (each, a “Directing Holder”) must be accompanied by a written representation from each
such Holder to the Issuers and the Trustee that such Holder is not (or, in the case such Holder is the
common depositary of Euroclear and Clearstream or its nominee, that such Holder is being instructed
solely by beneficial owners that have represented to such Holder that they are not) Net Short (a “Position
_Representation”), which representation, in the case of a Noteholder Direction relating to a notice of_
Default shall be deemed repeated at all times until the resulting Event of Default is cured or otherwise
ceases to exist or the Notes are accelerated. In addition, each Directing Holder must, at the time of
providing a Noteholder Direction, covenant to provide the Company with such other information as the
Company may reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such Holder’s
Position Representation within five Business Days of request therefor (a “Verification Covenant”). The
Trustee shall have no duty whatsoever to provide this information to the Company or to obtain this
information for the Company. In any case in which the Holder is the common depositary of Euroclear and
Clearstream or its nominee, any Position Representation or Verification Covenant required hereunder
shall be provided by the beneficial owner of the Notes in lieu of the common depositary of Euroclear and
Clearstream or its nominee. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to the
acceleration of the Notes, the Company determines in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe
a Directing Holder providing such Noteholder Direction was, at any relevant time, in breach of its
Position Representation and provides to the Trustee evidence that the Company has filed papers with a
court of competent jurisdiction seeking a determination that such Directing Holder was, at such time, in
breach of its Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Event of Default that resulted from
the applicable Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect to such Event of Default shall be
automatically stayed pending a final and non-appealable determination of a court of competent
jurisdiction on such matter. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration

129


-----

of the Notes, the Company provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that a Directing Holder
failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant, the cure period with respect to any Event of Default that
resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction shall be automatically stayed pending satisfaction of
such Verification Covenant. Any breach of the Position Representation shall result in such Holder’s
participation in such Noteholder Direction being disregarded; and, if, without the participation of such
Holder, the percentage of Notes held by the remaining Holders that provided such Noteholder Direction
would have been insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction
shall be void ab initio, with the effect that such Event of Default shall be deemed never to have occurred
and the Trustee shall be deemed not to have received such Noteholder Direction or any notice of such
Event of Default; provided, however, this shall not invalidate any indemnity or security provided by the
Directing Holders to the Trustee which obligations shall continue to survive. With their acquisition of the
Notes, each Holder and subsequent purchaser of the Notes consents to the delivery of its Position
Representation by the Trustee to the Company in accordance with the terms of this section. Each Holder
and subsequent purchaser of the Notes waives in the Indenture any and all claims, in law and/or in equity,
against the Trustee and agrees in the Indenture not to commence any legal proceeding against the Trustee
in respect of, and agrees in the Indenture that the Trustee will not be liable for any action that the Trustee
takes in accordance with this section, or arising out of or in connection with following instructions or
taking actions in accordance with a Noteholder Direction. The Company agrees to waive in the Indenture
any and all claims, in law and/or in equity, against the Trustee, and in the Indenture not to commence any
legal proceeding against the Trustee in respect of, and agree in the Indenture that the Trustee will not be
liable for any action that the Trustee takes in accordance with this section, or arising out of or in
connection with following instructions or taking actions in accordance with a Noteholder Direction except
to the extent of the Trustee’s gross negligence or willful misconduct, as determined in a final and nonappealable decision by a court of competent jurisdiction. The Company will confirm in the Indenture that
any and all other actions that the Trustee takes or omits to take under this section and all fees, costs and
expenses of the Trustee and its agents and counsel arising hereunder and in connection herewith shall be
covered by the Company’s indemnifications under the indemnification section of the Indenture.

If an Event of Default specified in clause (5) above with respect to the Company occurs and is
continuing, then all unpaid principal of, and premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all of the
outstanding Notes issued under the Indenture shall ipso _facto become and be immediately due and_
payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any holder of the Notes.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company so elects in writing to the Trustee, the sole
remedy of the holders for a failure to comply with the covenant described in “—Provision of Financial
Information,” will for the first 180 days after the occurrence of such failure consist exclusively of the
right to receive additional interest (“Additional Interest”) on the Notes at a rate per annum equal to 0.25%
for the first 180 days after the occurrence of such failure. The Additional Interest will accrue on all
outstanding Notes from and including the date on which such failure first occurs until such violation is
cured or waived and shall be payable on each Interest Payment Date to holders of record on the regular
Record Date immediately preceding the Interest Payment Date. On the 181st day after such failure (if
such violation is not cured or waived prior to such 181st day), such failure will then constitute an Event of
Default without any further notice or lapse of time, and the Notes will be subject to acceleration as
provided above.

The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a
required certificate in connection with another default (the “Initial Default”) occurs, then at the time such
Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in
connection with another default that resulted solely because of that Initial Default will also be cured
without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time
periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “Provision of Financial Information” or otherwise to deliver
any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon

130


-----

the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or such notice or certificate, as applicable, even
though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture.

The Indenture will provide that, at any time after a declaration of acceleration with respect to the
Notes, the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then-outstanding Notes may rescind
and cancel such declaration and its consequences:

(1) if the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree;

(2) if all existing Events of Default have been cured or waived except nonpayment of principal,
premium, if any, or accrued interest that has become due solely because of the acceleration;

(3) to the extent the payment of such interest is lawful, interest on overdue installments of
interest and overdue principal, which has become due otherwise than by such declaration of
acceleration, has been paid;

(4) if the Company has paid the Trustee its reasonable compensation and reimbursed the
Trustee for its expenses (including fees and expenses of counsel), disbursements and
advances; and

(5) in the event of the cure or waiver of an Event of Default under the Indenture of the type
described in clause (4) of the description above of Events of Default, the Trustee shall have
received an Officer’s Certificate that such Event of Default has been cured or waived.

No such rescission shall affect any subsequent Default under the Indenture or impair any right
consequent thereto.

The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes issued and then outstanding
under the Indenture may waive any existing Default or Event of Default under the Indenture, and its
consequences, except a default in the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the
Notes or a covenant or provision of the Indenture which cannot be modified or amended without the
consent of the holder of each outstanding Note affected.

Holders of the Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the
Indenture. The Trustee is under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Indenture at
the request, order or direction of any of the holders of the Notes, unless such holders have offered to the
Trustee indemnity or security satisfactory to the Trustee. Subject to all provisions of the Indenture and
applicable law, the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then-outstanding Notes
have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available
to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Trustee may withhold from
holders of the Notes notice of any continuing Default or Event of Default if it determines that withholding
notice is in their interest, except a Default or Event of Default relating to the payment of the principal of,
premium, if any, or interest on the Notes.

The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding compliance
with the Indenture. Upon becoming aware of any Default or Event of Default under the Indenture, the
Company is required to deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate specifying such Default or Event of
Default and the remedial action the Company proposes to take in connection therewith.

Documents, the Notes issued thereunder or the Note Guarantees provided thereunder may be amended or

Notes issued thereunder by the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
then-outstanding Notes with respect to a nonpayment default and a waiver of the payment
default that resulted from such acceleration);

(5) make any Note payable in money other than that stated in the Notes (subject to the
provisions set forth in the second paragraph following this paragraph);

(6) make any change in the provisions of the Indenture relating to waivers of past Defaults or
the rights of holders of Notes issued thereunder to receive payments of principal of, or
interest or premium, if any, on the Notes or impair the right of any holder of the Notes to
institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with respect to the Notes;

(7) waive a redemption payment with respect to any Note issued thereunder (other than a
payment required by one of the covenants described above under the caption “—
Repurchase of Notes upon a Change of Control Triggering Event” except as set forth in
item (10) below);

(8) make any change in the ranking or priority in right of payment of any Note issued
thereunder that would adversely affect the holders of the Notes thereunder (other than with
respect to provisions relating to the covenant described above under the caption “—Certain
Covenants—Limitation on Liens”);

(9) modify the Note Guarantees in any manner adverse to the holders of the Notes;

(10) amend, change or modify in any material respect the obligation of the Issuers to make and

consummate a Change of Control Offer with respect to the Notes in respect of a Change of
Control that has occurred; or

(11) make any change in the preceding amendment and waiver provisions.

132


-----

Notwithstanding the preceding, without the consent of any holder of the Notes, the Issuers, the
Guarantors and the Trustee and the Collateral Agent may amend or supplement the Indenture, the
Security Documents, the Notes or the Note Guarantees:

(1) to cure any ambiguity, mistake, defect or inconsistency;

(2) to provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes;

(3) to provide for the assumption by a Successor Company, a Co-Issuer Successor Company or
a successor company of a Guarantor, as applicable, of such Issuer’s or such Guarantor’s
obligations under the Indenture;

(4) to make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the holders of
the Notes or that does not adversely affect the legal rights under the Indenture of any such
holder in any material respect;

(5) to secure the Notes;

(6) to add a Note Guarantee;

(7) to conform the text of the Indenture or the Notes (including the related Note Guarantees) to
any provision of this Description of Notes;

(8) to provide for the issuance of Additional Notes in accordance with the provisions set forth
in the Indenture;

(9) to release a Guarantor from its Note Guarantee; provided that such release is in accordance
with the applicable provisions of the Indenture;

(10) to evidence and provide for the acceptance of appointment by a successor trustee or a

successor collateral agent under the Security Documents;

(11) to release any Lien granted in favor of the holders of the Notes pursuant to the covenant

described in “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens” upon release of the Lien securing
the underlying obligation that gave rise to such Lien; or

(12) to provide for the accession of any parties to the Security Documents (and other

amendments that are administrative or ministerial in nature) in connection with an
incurrence of additional First-Priority Obligations permitted by the Indenture.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the euro is unavailable to the Issuers due to the imposition of
exchange controls or other circumstances beyond the Issuer’s control (including the dissolution of the
euro) or if the euro is no longer being used by the then-member states of the EMU that have adopted the
euro as their currency or for the settlement of transactions by public institutions of or within the
international banking community, the Issuers and the Trustee shall be permitted, without the consent of
any other Person, to amend the terms of the Indenture and the Notes to change the currency in which the
obligations of the Issuers hereunder are payable in a manner consistent with then-prevailing market
practice for similarly situated issuers.

In addition, without the consent of holders of at least 66 2/3% in principal amount of Notes then
outstanding, no amendment, supplement or waiver may modify any Security Document or the provisions
in the Indenture dealing with the Collateral or the Security Documents that would have the impact of
releasing all or substantially all of the Collateral from the Liens of the Security Documents (except as

133


-----

permitted by the terms of the Indenture and the Security Documents) or change or alter the priority of the
security interests in the Collateral.

The consent of the holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of
any proposed amendment. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed
amendment.

After an amendment under the Indenture becomes effective, the Company will be required to
deliver to holders a notice briefly describing such amendment. However, the failure to give such notice to
all holders, or any defect therein, will not impair or affect the validity of the amendment.

**Defeasance**

The Issuers may, at their option and at any time, elect to have all of their obligations and the
obligations of the Guarantors released with respect to the outstanding Notes issued under the Indenture
and have Liens, if any, on the Collateral securing the Notes released (“Legal Defeasance”) except for:

(1) the rights of holders of outstanding Notes issued thereunder to receive payments in respect
of the principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on the Notes when such payments are due
from the trust referred to below;

(2) the Issuers’ obligations with respect to the Notes issued thereunder concerning issuing
temporary Notes, registration of Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the
maintenance of an office or agency for payment;

(3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee, and the obligations of the
Issuers and the Guarantors in connection therewith; and

(4) the Legal Defeasance provisions of the Indenture.

In addition, the Issuers may, at their option and at any time, elect to have their obligations and the
obligations of the Guarantors released with respect to certain covenants (including their obligation to
make Change of Control Offers) with respect to the Notes that are described in the Indenture and have
Liens, if any, on the Collateral securing the Notes released (“Covenant Defeasance”) and thereafter any
omission to comply with those covenants will not constitute a Default or Event of Default with respect to
the Notes issued thereunder. In the event that a Covenant Defeasance occurs, certain events (not including
nonpayment, bankruptcy, receivership, rehabilitation and insolvency events of the Company) described
under “—Events of Default” will no longer constitute an Event of Default with respect to the Notes issued
under the Indenture.

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance under the Indenture:

(1) the Issuers must irrevocably deposit with the Trustee, in trust, for the benefit of the holders
of the Notes issued thereunder, cash in euro, non-callable Euro Government Obligations, or
a combination of cash in euro and non-callable Euro Government Obligations, in amounts
as will be sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized investment bank, appraisal
firm or firm of independent public accountants delivered to the Trustee, to pay the principal
of, or interest and premium, if any, on the outstanding Notes issued thereunder on the stated
maturity or on the applicable redemption date, as the case may be, and the Issuers must
specify whether the Notes are being defeased to maturity or to a particular redemption date;

(2) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Issuers have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of
Counsel confirming that (a) the Issuers have received from, or there has been published by,

134


-----

the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) a ruling or (b) since the Issue Date, there has been
a change in the applicable U.S. federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and
based thereon such Opinion of Counsel will confirm that, the beneficial owners of the
outstanding Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax
purposes as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to federal income tax on
the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if
such Legal Defeasance had not occurred;

(3) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Issuers have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of
Counsel confirming that the beneficial owners of the outstanding Notes will not recognize
income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant
Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same
manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance
had not occurred;

(4) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture on the
date of such deposit (other than a Default or Event of Default resulting from or arising in
connection with the borrowing of funds to be applied to such deposit and the grant of any
Lien securing such borrowings);

(5) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance will not result in a breach or violation of,
or constitute a default under any material agreement or instrument (other than the Indenture)
to which any Issuer or any Guarantor is a party or by which any Issuer or any Guarantor is
bound;

(6) the Issuers must deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit
referred to in clause (1) was not made by the Issuers with the intent of preferring the holders
of the Notes over the other creditors of any Issuer or any Guarantor or with the intent of
defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors of any Issuer or any Guarantor or
others; and

(7) the Issuers must deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel,
each stating that all conditions precedent relating to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant
Defeasance of the Notes have been complied with.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Opinion of Counsel required by clauses (2) and (3) above
with respect to a Legal Defeasance or a Covenant Defeasance, as applicable, need not be delivered if all
the Notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (x) have become due and payable or (y)
will become due and payable on the maturity date within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the
Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the
Issuers.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect and the Liens, if any, on
the Collateral securing the Notes will be released, when:

(1) either:

(a) all the Notes that have been authenticated, except lost, stolen or destroyed Notes that
have been replaced or paid and Notes for whose payment money has theretofore been
deposited in trust or segregated and held in trust by the Issuers and thereafter repaid to
the Issuers, have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or

135


-----

(b) all the Notes that have not been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation have become
due and payable by reason of the giving of a notice of redemption or otherwise or will
become due and payable by reason of the giving of a notice of redemption or
otherwise within one year and the Issuers have irrevocably deposited or caused to be
deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust solely for the benefit of the holders of
the Notes, cash in euro, non-callable Euro Government Obligations or a combination
thereof, in amounts as will be sufficient, without consideration of any reinvestment of
interest, in the opinion of a nationally recognized investment bank, appraisal firm or
firm of independent public accountants, delivered to the Trustee, to pay and discharge
the entire Indebtedness on the Notes not delivered to the Trustee for cancellation for
principal, premium, if any, and accrued interest to the date of maturity or redemption;

(2) in the case of subclause (1)(b) above, no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing under the Indenture on the date of the deposit or will occur as a result of the
deposit (other than a Default or Event of Default resulting from or arising in connection
with borrowing of funds to be applied to such deposit and the grant of any Lien securing
such borrowing) and the deposit will not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a
default under, any other material instrument to which the Issuers are a party or by which the
Issuers are bound;

(3) the Issuers have paid or caused to be paid all sums payable by them under the Indenture;
and

(4) the Issuers have delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee under the Indenture to
apply the deposited money toward the payment of the Notes issued thereunder at maturity
or the redemption date, as the case may be.

In addition, the Issuers must deliver an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel to the
Trustee stating that all conditions precedent to satisfaction and discharge have been satisfied.

**Governing Law**

New York law will govern the Indenture, the Notes and the Note Guarantees.

**Concerning the Trustee**

Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas will be the Trustee under the Indenture. If the Trustee
becomes a creditor of any Issuer, the Indenture limits its right to obtain payment of claims in certain
cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The
Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions; however, if it acquires any conflicting interest it
must eliminate such conflict within 90 days.

Neither the Trustee, Collateral Agent, Registrar or Paying Agent have authorized the whole or
any part of this offering memorandum and none of them make any representation or warranty or accept
any responsibility as to the accuracy or completeness of the information contained in this offering
memorandum or any responsibility for any act or omission of the Issuers, the Guarantors or any other
person in connection with the issue and offering of the Notes”

**Notices**

All notices shall be deemed to have been given (i) if to the holder of a non-global Note, upon the
mailing by first-class mail, postage prepaid, of such notices to the holder at its registered address as
recorded in the Notes register, and (ii) if to the holder of a Global Note, upon delivery of such notices to

136


-----

the depositary in accordance with its applicable procedures, in each case, not later than the latest date, and
not earlier than the earliest date, prescribed in the Notes for the giving of such notice.

Neither the failure to give any notice to a particular holder, nor any defect in a notice given to a
particular holder, will affect the sufficiency of any notice given to another holder.

**Jurisdiction**

The Issuers and the Guarantors will consent to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any court of the
State of New York or any U.S. federal court, in each case, sitting in the Borough of Manhattan, The City
of New York, New York, United States, and any appellate court from any thereof.

**Form and Registration**

The Notes will be issued in registered form without interest coupons. No Notes will be issued in
bearer form.

137


-----

**Book-Entry, Settlement and Clearance**

**The Global Notes**

The Notes will be issued in the form of several registered notes in global form, without interest
coupons, as follows: Notes sold to QIBs under Rule 144A will be represented by the Rule 144A global
notes (the “Rule 144A Global Notes”); Notes sold in offshore transactions to non-U.S. persons in reliance
on Regulation S will be represented by the Regulation S global notes initially to be represented by the
temporary Regulation S global notes and, after completion of the global note exchange described below,
by the permanent Regulation S global notes (the “Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with the Rule
144A Global Notes, the “Global Notes”) and any Notes sold in the secondary market to institutional
accredited investors will be represented by the Institutional Accredited Investor global notes. Upon
issuance, the Global Notes will be deposited with, on or behalf of, the common depositary for the
accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream and registered in the name of the nominee of the common
depositary.

**Exchanges Among the Global Notes**

The distribution compliance period (the “Distribution Compliance Period”) will begin on the
closing date of this offering and end 40 days after the closing date. During the Distribution Compliance
Period, beneficial interests in the Regulation S Global Notes may be transferred only to non-U.S. persons
under Regulation S, QIBs under Rule 144A or institutional accredited investors. Beneficial interests in
one Global Note may generally be exchanged for interests in another Global Note. Depending on whether
the transfer is being made during or after the Distribution Compliance Period, and to which Global Note
the transfer is being made, the Trustee may require the seller to provide certain written certifications in
the form provided in the Indenture. In addition, in the case of a transfer of interests to the Institutional
Accredited Investor global note, the Trustee may require the buyer to deliver a representation letter in the
form provided in the Indenture that states, among other things, that the buyer is not acquiring Notes with
a view to distributing them in violation of the Securities Act.

A beneficial interest in a Global Note that is transferred to a person who takes delivery through
another Global Note will, upon transfer, become subject to any transfer restrictions and other procedures
applicable to beneficial interests in the other Global Note.

During the Distribution Compliance Period, beneficial interests in the temporary Regulation S
Global Notes and Rule 144A Global Notes may be transferred only to non-U.S. persons under Regulation
S, QIBs under Rule 144A or institutional accredited investors. After the Distribution Compliance Period
ends, beneficial interests in the temporary Regulation S Global Notes and Rule 144A Global Notes may
be exchanged for beneficial interests in the permanent Regulation S Global Notes and Rule 144A Global
Notes, respectively, upon certification that those interests are owned either by non-U.S. persons or by
U.S. persons who purchased those interests pursuant to an exemption from, or in transactions not subject
to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Beneficial interests in the Global Notes may not be
exchanged for Notes in physical, certificated form except in the limited circumstances described below.
Each Global Note and beneficial interests in each Global Note will be subject to restrictions on transfer as
described in the section titled “Transfer Restrictions.”

**Book-Entry Procedures for the Global Notes**

All interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and
Clearstream, as applicable. The Issuers provide the following summaries of those operations and
procedures solely for the convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement
system are controlled by that settlement system and may be changed at any time. Neither the Issuers, the
Trustee, nor the initial purchasers take any responsibility for those operations or procedures, and the
Issuers and the initial purchasers urge investors to contact the system or their participants directly to
discuss these matters.

Euroclear and Clearstream have established procedures to facilitate transfers of interests in the
Global Notes among participants in those settlement systems. However, the settlement systems are not
obligated to perform these procedures and may discontinue or change these procedures at any time.
Neither the Issuers nor the Trustee will have any responsibility for the performance by Euroclear or
Clearstream or their participants or indirect participants of their obligations under the rules and
procedures governing their operations.

Euroclear has advised us that it was created in 1968 to hold securities for its participants and to
clear and settle transactions between Euroclear participants through simultaneous electronic book-entry
delivery against payment, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of certificates and any risk
from lack of simultaneous transfers of securities and cash. Euroclear provides various other services,
including securities lending and borrowing and interfaces with domestic markets in several countries. All
operations are conducted by Euroclear and all Euroclear securities clearance accounts and Euroclear cash
accounts are accounts with Euroclear, not Euroclear Clearance Systems S.C. (the “Cooperative”). The
Cooperative establishes policy for Euroclear on behalf of Euroclear participants. Euroclear participants
include banks (including central banks), securities brokers and dealers and other professional financial
intermediaries and may include the underwriters. Indirect access to Euroclear is also available to other
firms that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear participant, either directly or
indirectly.

Securities clearance accounts and cash accounts with Euroclear are governed by the Terms and
Conditions Governing Use of Euroclear and the related Operating Procedures of the Euroclear System,
and applicable Belgian laws (collectively, the “Euroclear Terms and Conditions”). The Euroclear Terms
and Conditions govern transfers of securities and cash within Euroclear, withdrawals of securities and
cash from Euroclear and receipts of payment with respect to securities in Euroclear. All securities in
Euroclear are held on a fungible basis without attribution of specific certificates to specific securities
clearance accounts. Euroclear acts under the Euroclear Terms and Conditions only on behalf of Euroclear
participants and has no record of or relationship with persons holding through Euroclear participants.

Distributions with respect to the Notes held beneficially through Euroclear will be credited to the
cash accounts of Euroclear participants in accordance with the Euroclear Terms and Conditions, to the
extent received by Euroclear.

Clearstream is incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg as a professional depository.
Clearstream holds securities for Clearstream participants and facilitates the clearance and settlement of
securities transactions between Clearstream participants through electronic book-entry changes in
accounts of Clearstream participants, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of certificates.
Clearstream provides to its participants, among other things, services for safekeeping, administration,
clearance and settlement of internationally traded securities and securities lending and borrowing.
Clearstream also deals with domestic securities markets in several countries. As a professional depository,
Clearstream is subject to regulation by the Luxembourg Monetary Institute. Clearstream participants are

139


-----

financial institutions around the world, including underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust
companies and clearing corporations and certain other organizations and may include the initial
purchasers. Indirect access to Clearstream is also available to others, such as banks, brokers, dealers and
trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Clearstream participant
either directly or indirectly.

Distributions with respect to the Notes held beneficially through Clearstream will be credited to
cash accounts of Clearstream participants in accordance with its rules and procedures, to the extent
received by Clearstream.

**_Certificated Notes_**

A Global Note shall be exchangeable for certificated notes if (x) Euroclear or Clearstream, as
applicable, acting through itself or the Paying Agent, (a) notifies the Company that it is unwilling or
unable to continue as a clearing system in respect of such global note or (b) has ceased to be a clearing
system and in each case a successor clearing system is not appointed, or (y) certain other events provided
in the Indenture should occur.

**_Other Information_**

The Legal Entity Identifier (“LEI”) code of (i) the Company is 549300BO9IWPF3S48F93, (ii)
HFC Inc. is 5299009G4CWC0GF7HW41 and (iii) HFC Prestige is 529900A4PUPO9YSFAO34.

Solely for operational purposes of Euroclear and Clearstream, Coty Inc. has been designated as
the issuer, HFC Prestige Products, Inc. and HFC Prestige International U.S. LLC have been designated as
co-issuers.

**U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations**

The following discussion is a summary of U.S. federal income tax considerations generally
applicable to the ownership, sale or other disposition of the Notes by investors who acquire Notes
pursuant to this offering at the “issue price” for such Notes (the first price at which a substantial amount
of Notes is sold for money to investors, not including bond houses, brokers or similar persons or
organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers). This summary is
based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder, administrative rulings and judicial decisions, all in effect as of the date hereof,
all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations, possibly with retroactive effect. This
summary does not discuss all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be important to particular
investors in light of their individual circumstances, including, but not limited to, investors subject to
special tax rules (e.g., former citizens and former long-term residents of the United States, “controlled
foreign corporations,” “passive foreign investment companies,” and banks, insurance companies, or other
financial institutions), investors that will hold the Notes as a part of a straddle, hedge, conversion,
synthetic security, constructive ownership transaction or other integrated transaction for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, accrual basis taxpayers subject to special tax accounting rules pursuant to Section
451(b) of the Code, investors subject to the alternative minimum tax (including corporations subject to
the alternative minimum tax on financial statement income), or entities that are treated as partnerships for
U.S. federal income tax purposes and partners of such partnerships, all of whom may be subject to tax
rules that differ materially from those summarized below. In addition, this summary does not discuss
other U.S. federal tax consequences (e.g., estate or gift tax or the Medicare tax on certain investment
income) or any state, local, or non-U.S. tax considerations. This summary is written for investors that will
hold the Notes offered hereby as “capital assets” (generally, property held for investment) under the
Code.

**_The U.S. federal income tax treatment of the holders of the Notes depends in some instances_**
**_on determinations of facts and interpretations of complex provisions of U.S. federal income tax law for_**
**_which no clear precedent or authority may be available. In addition, the tax consequences to any_**
**_particular holder of the Notes will depend upon the holder’s particular tax circumstances. Each_**
**_investor is urged to consult its tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal, state, local, estate and gift and_**
**_non-U.S. income and other tax considerations applicable to it, in light of its particular circumstances,_**
**_of acquiring, holding, exchanging, or otherwise disposing of the Notes._**

If any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds
the Notes, the treatment of a partner (or person or entity treated as a partner) in the partnership will
generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership and certain
determinations made at the partner level. Investors that are partnerships and partners in such partnerships
are urged to consult their tax advisors about the U.S. federal income tax consequences of purchasing,
holding and disposing of Notes.

**Additional Payments**

In certain circumstances, we will be required to pay amounts on the Notes in excess of the stated
interest and principal payable on the Notes or will be required to pay amounts prior to the normally
scheduled payment dates. For example, if we experience specific kinds of change of control triggering
events with respect to the Notes, we will be required to offer to repurchase all or part of the Notes at
101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but excluding the date of
redemption (see “Description of Notes—Repurchase of Notes upon a Change of Control Triggering
Event”). We intend to take the position that such circumstances are a remote possibility and therefore do
not intend to treat the Notes as subject to the special rules governing certain contingent payment debt

141


-----

instruments (which, if applicable, would affect the timing, amount and character of income with respect to
a Note). Our determination in this regard is not, however, binding on the IRS and it is possible the IRS
may take a position which results in different tax consequences than those described below. The
following discussion assumes that the Notes will not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments
for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

**U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders**

For purposes of this summary, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that, for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, is an individual, corporation, estate or trust and is (i) an individual who is a
U.S. citizen or a resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation or other entity treated as a corporation for
U.S. federal income tax purposes, created in or organized under the law of the United States, any state
thereof or the District of Columbia, (iii) an estate the income of which is includible in gross income for
U.S. federal income tax purposes regardless of its source, or (iv) a trust (A) the administration of which is
subject to the primary supervision of a U.S. court and with respect to which one or more “United States
persons” (within the meaning of the Code) have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the
trust or (B) that has in effect a valid election under applicable United States Department of the Treasury
regulations to be treated as a United States person.

It is expected, and this discussion assumes, that the Notes will be issued with no more than a de
_minimis amount (as determined under applicable Treasury Regulations) of original issue discount. If,_
however, the principal amount of the Notes exceeds their issue price by a specified de minimis amount or
more (as determined under applicable Treasury Regulations), a U.S. Holder will be required to include
that excess in income as original issue discount, as it accrues, in accordance with a constant yield method
based on a compounding of interest, before the receipt of cash attributable to this income.

This discussion describes certain special rules applicable to U.S. Holders who have a U.S. dollar
functional currency that hold debt instruments that are denominated in a currency other than the U.S.
dollar (such as the Notes). The rules applicable to the Notes could require some or all of the gain or loss
on the sale, exchange, or other disposition of the Notes to be recharacterized as ordinary income or loss.
The rules applicable to the Notes are complex, and their application may depend on a U.S. Holder’s
particular U.S. federal income tax situation. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the
U.S. federal income tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of the Notes.

**_Interest. Interest paid on a Note will be taxable to a U.S. Holder as ordinary interest income at the_**
time it accrues or is received in accordance with the U.S. Holder’s method of accounting for U.S. federal
income tax purposes.

U.S. Holders using the cash method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes will be
required to include in income the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency payment on a Note when the
payment of interest is received (including a payment attributable to accrued and unpaid interest upon the
sale, exchange, redemption, repurchase or other taxable disposition of a Note). The U.S. dollar value of
the foreign currency payment is determined by translating the foreign currency received at the spot rate
for such foreign currency on the date the payment is received, regardless of whether the payment is in fact
converted to U.S. dollars at that time. The U.S. dollar value will be the U.S. Holder’s tax basis in the
foreign currency received. A U.S. Holder will not recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss with
respect to the receipt of such payment.

U.S. Holders using the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes will be
required to include in income the U.S. dollar value of the amount of interest income that has accrued and
is otherwise required to be taken into account with respect to a Note during an accrual period. The U.S.

142


-----

dollar value of the accrued income will be determined by translating the income at the average rate of
exchange for the accrual period or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the
average rate for the partial period within the taxable year. A U.S. Holder may elect, however, to translate
the accrued interest income using the spot rate on the last day of the accrual period or, with respect to an
accrual period that spans two taxable years, using the exchange rate on the last day of the taxable year. If
the last day of an accrual period is within five business days of the date of receipt of the accrued interest,
a U.S. Holder may translate the interest using the spot rate on the date of receipt. The above election will
apply to all other debt obligations held by the U.S. Holder and may not be changed without the consent of
the IRS. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors before making the above election. Upon
receipt of an interest payment (including upon the sale, exchange, redemption or other taxable disposition
of the Notes, the receipt of proceeds which include amounts attributable to accrued interest previously
included in income), the holder will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss in an amount equal
to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of such payment (determined by translating the foreign
currency received at the spot rate for such foreign currency on the date such payment is received) and the
U.S. dollar value of the interest income previously included in income with respect to such payment. This
gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss.

**_Foreign Currency Exchange Gain or Loss. If a U.S. Holder purchases a Note with previously_**
owned foreign currency, foreign currency exchange gain or loss (which will be treated as ordinary income
or loss) will be recognized in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the tax basis in the
foreign currency and the U.S. dollar fair market value of the foreign currency used to purchase the Note,
determined on the date of purchase. The tax basis in foreign currency received as interest on a Note will
be the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency determined at the spot rate in effect on the date the foreign
currency is received. Any gain or loss recognized on a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption, or other
taxable disposition of foreign currency (including its exchange for U.S. dollars or its use to purchase debt
securities) will be U.S. source ordinary income or loss.

**_Disposition of the Notes. Upon a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable_**
disposition of a Note, a U.S. Holder will recognize taxable gain or loss equal to the difference between
the amount realized on the disposition and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Note, which will
generally equal the cost of the Note. For these purposes, the amount realized will be equal to the U.S.
dollar value of the foreign currency on the date the payment is received, or the Notes are disposed of (or
deemed disposed of because of a material change in the terms of the Notes), less any portion allocable to
any accrued and unpaid stated interest, which portion will be taxed as ordinary interest income. The
amount of any payment in or adjustments measured by foreign currency will be equal to the U.S. dollar
value of the foreign currency on the date of the purchase or adjustment. If, however, a Note is traded on
an established securities market, and the U.S. Holder uses the cash basis method of tax accounting, the
U.S. dollar value of the amount realized will be determined by translating the foreign currency payment at
the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption, or other
taxable disposition. A U.S. Holder that uses the accrual basis method of tax accounting may elect the
same treatment with respect to the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of
Notes traded on an established securities market, provided that the election is applied consistently. Except
with respect to the foreign currency rules discussed below, gain or loss realized on the sale, exchange,
retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note will generally be capital gain or loss and will
be long-term capital gain or loss if at the time of the disposition the Note has been held for more than one
year. Long-term capital gains recognized by non-corporate taxpayers are subject to reduced tax rates. The
deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

A portion of the gain or loss with respect to the principal amount of a Note may be treated as
foreign currency exchange gain or loss. Foreign currency exchange gain or loss will be treated as ordinary
income or loss. For these purposes, the principal amount of the Notes is the purchase price for the Notes

143


-----

calculated in the foreign currency on the date of purchase, and the amount of exchange gain or loss
recognized is equal to the difference between (i) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount determined
on the date of the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of the Note and (ii)
the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount determined on the date the Note was purchased. The amount
of foreign currency exchange gain or loss will be limited to the amount of overall gain or loss realized on
the disposition of the Notes.

The tax basis in foreign currency received on the sale, exchange, retirement, or other disposition
of a Note will be equal to the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency, determined at the time of the sale,
exchange, retirement, redemption, or other taxable disposition. As discussed above, if the Notes are
traded on an established securities market, a cash basis U.S. Holder (or, upon election, an accrual basis
U.S. Holder) will determine the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency by translating the foreign
currency received at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the sale, exchange, retirement,
redemption, or other taxable disposition. Accordingly, in such case, no foreign currency exchange gain or
loss will result from currency fluctuations between the trade date and settlement date of a sale, exchange,
retirement, redemption, or other taxable disposition. Any gain or loss recognized on a sale, exchange,
retirement, redemption, or other taxable disposition of foreign currency (including its exchange for U.S.
dollars or its use to purchase debt securities) will be ordinary income or loss.

**_Information reporting and backup withholding. Information returns generally will be filed with_**
the IRS in connection with payments on the Notes and the proceeds from a sale or other disposition of the
Notes. A U.S. Holder will be subject to backup withholding on these payments if the U.S. Holder fails to
provide its correct taxpayer identification number to the applicable withholding agent and comply with
certain certification procedures or otherwise establish an exemption from backup withholding. Backup
withholding is not an additional tax. The amount of any backup withholding from a payment to a U.S.
Holder will be allowed as a credit against the U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability and may
entitle the U.S. Holder to a refund, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

**U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders**

For purposes of this summary, a “Non-U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that is not a
U.S. Holder.

**_Interest. Subject to any backup withholding or withholding under FATCA (as defined below), in_**
each case as discussed below, all payments of interest to a Non-U.S. Holder will be exempt from U.S.
federal income and withholding tax, provided that: (i) such Non-U.S. Holder does not own, actually or
constructively, 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of any Issuer’s stock
entitled to vote; (ii) such Non-U.S. Holder is not a controlled foreign corporation related, directly or
indirectly, to any Issuer through sufficient stock ownership; (iii) such interest is not effectively connected
with such Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a U.S. trade or business; (iv) such Non-U.S. Holder is not a bank
receiving interest described in Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code; and (v) such Non-U.S. Holder certifies,
under penalties of perjury, to the applicable withholding agent on IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or
appropriate substitute form) that it is not a United States person and provides its name, address and certain
other required information, or certain other certification requirements are satisfied.

If a Non-U.S. Holder cannot satisfy the requirements described above, payments of interest will
be subject to the 30% U.S. federal withholding tax, unless such Non-U.S. Holder provides the applicable
withholding agent with a properly executed (i) IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or appropriate
substitute form) claiming an exemption from or reduction in withholding tax under the benefit of an
applicable income tax treaty or (ii) IRS Form W-8ECI (or appropriate substitute form) stating that interest

144


-----

paid or accrued on the Notes is not subject to withholding tax because it is effectively connected with the
conduct of a trade or business in the United States.

If a Non-U.S. Holder is engaged in a trade or business in the United States, and if interest on the
Notes is effectively connected with the conduct of such trade or business (and, if a tax treaty applies, is
attributable to permanent establishment), the Non-U.S. Holder will generally be subject to U.S. federal
income tax on a net income basis on such interest in the same manner as if the Non-U.S. Holder were a
United States person, unless an applicable income tax treaty provides otherwise. In addition, if such a
Non-U.S. Holder is a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such holder may also be subject to
a branch profits tax equal to 30% (or such lower rate provided by an applicable treaty) of its effectively
connected earnings and profits for the taxable year, subject to certain adjustments.

**_Disposition of the Notes. Subject to any backup withholding or withholding under FATCA (as_**
defined below), in each case as discussed below, and except with respect to accrued and unpaid interest,
which will be taxable as described above under “—Interest,” a Non-U.S. Holder will generally not be
subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax on the receipt of payments of principal on a Note, or on
any gain recognized upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a
Note, unless in the case of gain (i) such gain is effectively connected with the conduct by such Non-U.S.
Holder of a trade or business in the United States (in which case such gain will be taxed as discussed
below) or (ii) such Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or
more in the taxable year of disposition, and certain other conditions are met (in which case such Non-U.S.
Holder will be subject to a flat 30% tax on the gain derived from the sale, which may be offset by U.S.source capital losses).

If a Non-U.S. Holder is engaged in a trade or business in the United States, and if gain recognized
on the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of the Notes, is effectively
connected with the conduct of such trade or business (and, if a tax treaty applies, is attributable to a
permanent establishment), the Non-U.S. Holder will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a
net income basis on such gain in the same manner as if the Non-U.S. Holder were a United States person,
unless an applicable income tax treaty provides otherwise. In addition, if such a Non-U.S. Holder is a
corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such holder may also be subject to a branch profits tax
equal to 30% (or such lower rate provided by an applicable treaty) of its effectively connected earnings
and profits for the taxable year, subject to certain adjustments.

**_Information reporting and backup withholding. A Non-U.S. Holder may be required to comply_**
with certain certification procedures to establish that the holder is not a United States person in order to
avoid backup withholding with respect to our payments of principal and interest on, or the proceeds of the
sale or other disposition of, a Note. Such requirements are generally satisfied by providing a properly
executed IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or appropriate substitute form), as described above. Backup
withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will be
allowed as a refund or a credit against that Non-U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability provided
the required information is furnished to the IRS. In certain circumstances, the name and address of the
Non-U.S. Holder and the amount of interest paid on the Non-U.S. Holder’s Note, as well as the amount, if
any, of tax withheld, may be reported to the IRS. Copies of these information returns generally may also
be made available under the provisions of a specific treaty or agreement to the tax authorities of the
country in which the Non-U.S. Holder resides.

**_Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act. Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code and the_**
Treasury Regulations and administrative guidance promulgated thereunder (“FATCA”) generally impose
withholding at a rate of 30% in certain circumstances on interest payable on the Notes held by or through
certain financial institutions (including investment funds), unless such institution (x) enters into, and

145


-----

complies with, an agreement with the IRS to report, on an annual basis, information with respect to
interests in, and accounts maintained by, the institution that are owned by certain U.S. persons or by
certain non-U.S. entities that are wholly or partially owned by U.S. persons and to withhold on certain
payments, (y) if required under an intergovernmental agreement between the United States and an
applicable foreign country, reports such information to its local tax authority, which will then exchange
such information with the U.S. authorities, or (z) otherwise qualifies for an exemption from withholding
under FATCA. Accordingly, the entity through which the Notes are held will affect the determination of
whether such withholding is required. Similarly, interest payable on the Notes held by or through an
entity that is a non-financial non-U.S. entity that does not qualify under certain exemptions generally will
be subject to withholding at a rate of 30%, unless such entity either (x) certifies that such entity does not
have any “substantial United States owners,” (y) provides certain information regarding the entity’s
“substantial United States owners,” which we will in turn provide to the United States Department of the
Treasury, or (z) otherwise qualifies for an exemption from withholding under FATCA.

Current provisions of the Code and Treasury Regulations would also treat gross proceeds from
the disposition of the Notes as subject to FATCA withholding. However, proposed Treasury Regulations,
if finalized in their current form, would eliminate FATCA withholding on gross proceeds entirely.
Taxpayers generally may rely on those proposed regulations until final Treasury Regulations are issued.

If withholding under FATCA is required on any payment related to the Notes, investors not
otherwise subject to withholding (or that otherwise would be entitled to a reduced rate of withholding) on
such payment may be required to seek a refund or credit from the IRS to obtain the benefit of such
exemption (or reduction). Prospective investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the possible
implications of FATCA on an investment in the Notes.

**ERISA and Other Benefit Plan Considerations**

Sections 404 and 406 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended
(“ERISA”) and Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) restrict
certain transactions by employee benefit plans that are subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of
Title I of ERISA, plans, accounts and other arrangements that are subject to Section 4975 of the Code,
and entities the underlying assets of which are deemed to include assets of any such employee benefit
plan, plan, account or arrangement (all of the foregoing, collectively, “Plans”) and impose certain duties
on persons who are fiduciaries of such Plans with respect to the investment of Plan assets.

Certain employee benefit plans, including governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of
ERISA), certain church plans (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA) and non-U.S. plans (as described in
Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA), are not subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of Title I of ERISA
or Section 4975 of the Code, but may be subject to state, local, federal, non-U.S. or other laws or
regulations substantively similar to such provisions of ERISA or the Code (“Similar Laws”).

Any fiduciary or other person making a decision to invest assets of a Plan or a plan subject to
Similar Law in the Notes should review carefully with their legal advisers and determine, among other
things, whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing such Plan
or plan subject to Similar Law and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Laws
relating to a fiduciary’s duties to such Plan or plan, including the prudence, diversification and conflicts
of interest provisions of ERISA, and whether the acquisition, holding or disposition of the Notes (or any
interest in a Note) could constitute or give rise to a non-exempt prohibited transaction under ERISA or the
Code (as discussed below) or a violation of any Similar Law. A violation of the prohibited transaction
rules may result, among other possible effects, in imposition of an excise tax and other penalties or
liabilities under ERISA and the Code.

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit Plans from engaging in specified
transactions involving Plan assets with persons or entities who are “parties in interest” within the meaning
of ERISA or “disqualified persons” within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless an exemption
is available. The acquisition, holding or disposition of the Notes (or any interest in a Note) by or on behalf
of a Plan could give rise to a prohibited transaction if the transaction is with a “party in interest” or
“disqualified person” (as defined in ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, respectively) with respect to
that Plan. For example, the acquisition or holding of the Notes (or any interest in a Note) by or on behalf
of a Plan could be considered to constitute or give rise to a prohibited transaction if persons such as the
Issuers, an initial purchaser, the trustee or any of their respective affiliates (collectively, the “Transaction
Parties”) is or becomes a party in interest or disqualified person with respect to the Plan.

In that regard, certain exemptions from the prohibited transaction rules could potentially be
applicable to the acquisition, holding or disposition of the Notes (or any interest in a Note) by a Plan,
depending on the circumstances. Included among these prohibited transaction exemptions are: the
statutory exemption under Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code, regarding
transactions with certain non-fiduciary service providers to Plans; prohibited transaction class exemption
(“PTCE”) 90-1, regarding investments by insurance company pooled separate accounts; PTCE 95-60, as
amended by PTCE 2002-13, regarding investments by insurance company general accounts; PTCE 91-38,
as amended by PTCE 2002-13, regarding investments by bank collective investment funds; PTCE 96-23,
regarding transactions effected by in-house asset managers; and PTCE 84-14, as amended by PTCE 200213, regarding transactions effected by “qualified professional asset managers.” However, each such
exemption imposes various requirements and the scope of relief under these prohibited transaction
exemptions might not cover all acts that could be considered prohibited transactions in connection with
investment in the Notes by Plans. No assurance can be given that any of the above exemptions, or any

147


-----

other exemptions, would cover any or all prohibited transactions that might arise in connection with a
Plan’s acquisition, holding and disposition of the Notes (or any interest in a Note).

Accordingly, each purchaser or transferee of the Notes (or any interest in a Note) will be deemed
to represent and warrant that either (i) it is not, and is not directly or indirectly acquiring the Notes (or any
interest in a Note) for, on behalf of or with any assets of, a Plan or a plan subject to Similar Law or (ii) its
acquisition, holding and disposition of the Notes (or any interest in a Note) will not constitute or result in
a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a
violation of Similar Law and none of the Transaction Parties are or will be a fiduciary with respect to the
acquisition, holding or disposition of the Notes by the Plan.

Each purchaser and holder of the Notes has the exclusive responsibility for ensuring that its
purchase, holding and subsequent disposition of the Notes (including any interest in a Note) do not violate
the fiduciary or prohibited transaction rules of ERISA or the Code or provisions of any applicable Similar
Laws. The sale of any Notes to any Plan or any plan subject to Similar Law is in no respect a
representation by any of the Transaction Parties or any of their agents or representatives that such an
investment is appropriate for, or meets all relevant legal requirements with respect to investments by,
Plans or plans subject to Similar Laws generally or any particular Plan or plan subject to Similar Law.
Neither discussion nor anything in this offering memorandum is or is intended to be investment advice
directed at any potential purchaser that is a Plan or a plan subject to Similar Law, or at such purchasers
generally.

**European Union Proposed Financial Transactions Tax**

On February 14, 2013, the European Commission published a proposal (the “Commission’s
Proposal”) of a directive for a common financial transaction tax (“FTT”) in Belgium, Germany, Estonia,
Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia (together, except for Estonia, the
“Participating EU Member States”). However, Estonia has since withdrawn from participating.

The Commission’s Proposal has very broad scope and could, if introduced, apply to certain
dealings in the Notes (including secondary market transactions) in certain circumstances.

At the Economic and Financial Affairs Council meeting of June 14, 2019, the Participating EU
Member States agreed to continue negotiations on the basis of a joint French-German proposal based on
the French financial transactions tax model, which in principle would only concern shares of listed
companies whose head office is in a Member State of the European Union. However, the FTT proposal
remains subject to negotiation between the Participating EU Member States. It may therefore be altered
prior to any implementation, the scope and timing of which remains uncertain. Additional EU Member
States may decide to participate, and Participating EU Member States may decide to withdraw.
Prospective holders of the Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the FTT.

**Plan of Distribution**

Under the terms and conditions contained in a purchase agreement dated as of the date hereof,
HSBC Bank plc and UniCredit Bank AG are acting as representatives of the several initial purchasers of
the Notes. The Issuers have agreed to sell to the initial purchasers, and the initial purchasers have agreed,
severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Issuers, the following principal amounts of Notes set forth
opposite their names below.

**Principal Amount of**

**Notes to be**

**Initial Purchaser** **Purchased**

HSBC Bank plc .............................................................................................. €
UniCredit Bank AG ........................................................................................ €
BNP Paribas ................................................................................................... €
Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank ............................................. €
ING Bank N.V., London Branch ..................................................................... €
Banco Santander, S.A. .................................................................................... €
SMBC Nikko Capital Markets Limited .......................................................... €
MUFG Securities EMEA plc .......................................................................... €
TD Securities (USA) LLC .............................................................................. €
Citizens JMP Securities, LLC ......................................................................... €
Capital One Securities, Inc. ............................................................................. €
Truist Securities, Inc. ..................................................................................... €
Fifth Third Securities, Inc. ............................................................................. €
Total: .................................................................................................. €500,000,000

The purchase agreement provides that the initial purchasers of the Notes are obligated to purchase
all of such Notes if any are purchased. The purchase agreement provides that if an initial purchaser of the
Notes defaults, the purchase commitments of non-defaulting initial purchasers of the Notes may be
increased or the offering may be terminated. The Issuers have agreed in the purchase agreement that they
will not offer or sell any of our debt securities (other than the Notes) for a period of 60 days after the date
of this offering memorandum without the prior consent of the representative for the Notes.

The initial purchasers propose to offer the Notes initially at the relevant offering price on the
cover page of this offering memorandum. After the initial offering, the offering price may be changed.
The initial purchasers may offer and sell notes through certain of their affiliates. In addition, one or more
of the initial purchasers may not be U.S.-registered broker-dealers. All sales of the Notes in the United
States will be made by or through U.S.-registered broker-dealers, which may include such affiliates of one
or more of the initial purchasers.

The Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold
within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons except to persons reasonably
believed to be QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A and to non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions outside the
United States in reliance on Regulation S. Each of the initial purchasers has agreed that, except as
permitted by the purchase agreement, it will not offer, sell or deliver the Notes (i) as part of its
distribution at any time or (ii) otherwise until 40 days after the later of the commencement of the offering
and the closing date, within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons, and it
will have sent to each broker/dealer to which it sells Notes in reliance on Regulation S during such 40-day
period a confirmation or other notice detailing the restrictions on offers and sales of the Notes within the
United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons. Terms used in this paragraph have the

150


-----

meanings given to them by Regulation S under the Securities Act. Resales of the Notes are restricted as
described under “Transfer Restrictions.”

In addition, until 40 days after the commencement of the offering, an offer or sale of Notes within
the United States by a broker/dealer (whether or not it is participating in the offering) may violate the
registration requirements of the Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than pursuant to
Rule 144A.

The Issuers and the Guarantors have agreed to indemnify the initial purchasers against liabilities,
including liabilities under the Securities Act, or to contribute to payments that they may be required to
make in that respect.

The Notes are a new issue of securities for which there currently is no market. In addition, the
Notes are subject to certain restrictions on resale and transfer as described under “Transfer Restrictions.”
We intend to apply for the listing of and permission to deal in the Notes on the Official List of TISE.
However, we cannot guarantee that the application to list the Notes on the Official List of TISE will be
approved as of the issue date or any date thereafter, that the permission to deal in the Notes will be
granted or that the listing of the Notes will be maintained, and settlement of the Notes is not conditioned
on obtaining this listing. TISE is not a regulated market for the purposes of MiFID II.

Certain of the initial purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes as
permitted by applicable law. They are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes, and the
ability or interest of the initial purchasers to make a market in the Notes may be impacted by changes in
any regulatory requirements applicable to the marketing, holding and trading of, and issuing quotations
with respect to, the Notes (including as a result of regulatory developments such as the SEC’s
interpretation of Rule 15c2-11 under the Exchange Act and its application to debt securities), and any
market-making may be discontinued at any time at such initial purchaser’s sole discretion. Accordingly,
no assurance can be given as to the development or liquidity of any market for the Notes. If an active
trading market for the Notes does not develop, the market price and liquidity of the Notes may be
adversely affected. If the Notes are traded, they may trade at a discount from their initial offering price,
depending on prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities, our operating performance and
financial condition, general economic conditions and other factors.

You should be aware that the laws and practices of certain countries require investors to pay
stamp taxes and other charges in connection with purchases of securities.

In connection with the issue of the Notes, the Stabilizing Manager or persons acting on its behalf
may over-allot Notes or effect transactions with a view to supporting the market price of the Notes at a
level that is higher than that which might otherwise prevail. However, we cannot assure you that the
Stabilizing Manager or persons acting on its behalf will undertake stabilization action. Any stabilization
action may begin on or after the date on which adequate public disclosure of the terms of the offer of
Notes is made and, if begun, may be ended at any time, but it must end no later than the earlier of 30 days
after the issue date of the Notes and 60 days after the date of the allotment of the Notes.

In the ordinary course of their respective businesses, the initial purchasers and certain of their
respective affiliates have in the past and may in the future engage in commercial or investment banking or
other transactions of a financial nature with us, including the provision of certain advisory services and
the making of loans to us and our affiliates, for which they have received (or will receive) customary
compensation. In particular, certain of the initial purchasers or their respective affiliates act as agents
and/or lenders under our Existing Credit Facilities. As a result, certain of the initial purchasers or their

151


-----

affiliates may receive a portion of the net proceeds from this offering, and/or customary compensation for
acting in such capacities. See “Use of Proceeds” for more information.

In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the initial purchasers and their
affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or
related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and
for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities
and/or instruments of ours or our affiliates (including the Notes). Certain of the initial purchasers or their
affiliates that have a lending relationship with us or our affiliates routinely hedge, and certain other of
those initial purchases or their affiliates may hedge, their credit exposure to us and/or our affiliates
consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, such initial purchaser and their
affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of
credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in securities (including potentially the Notes). Any
such credit default swaps or short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes. The
initial purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or
express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or
recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.

**Notice to Prospective Investors in the European Economic Area**

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be
offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail
investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1)
of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU)

This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes in any
member state of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from
the requirement to publish a prospectus for offer of the Notes. This offering memorandum is not to be
considered a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Regulation and any relevant implementing
measure in each member state of the EEA.

**Notice to Prospective Investors in the United Kingdom**

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be
offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the UK. For these purposes, a retail
investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of
Regulation (EU) No. 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law in the UK by virtue of the EUWA; or (ii)
a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under
the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional

forms part of domestic law in the UK by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering
or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the UK has been prepared
and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the
UK may be lawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation. This offering memorandum has been prepared on
the basis that any offer of the Notes in the UK will be made pursuant to an exemption under the UK
Prospectus Regulation and the FSMA from a requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of securities.
