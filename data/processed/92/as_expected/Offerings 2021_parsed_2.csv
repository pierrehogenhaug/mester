See “Description of Notes—Security—Intercreditor Agreement.” Priority ..........................................................................** The Notes will be secured senior obligations of the Issuer and will be: - equal in right of payment with all existing and future senior indebtedness of the Issuer, including its obligations under the Existing Credit Facilities and the Existing Notes; - effectively _pari passu with all existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer that is secured by a first-priority lien on the Collateral, including its obligations under the Existing Credit Facilities and the Existing Secured Notes, to the extent of the value of the Collateral; - senior in right of payment to any future subordinated indebtedness of the Issuer; - effectively senior to all existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer that is unsecured, including the Issuer’s obligations under the existing Unsecured Notes, or that is secured by junior liens on the Collateral, to the extent of the value of the Collateral; - structurally subordinated to all liabilities of any of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes; and - effectively junior to any indebtedness of the Issuer that is secured by assets that are not Collateral, to the extent of the value of such assets. As of March 31, 2021, after giving effect to the offering of the Notes offered hereby, the issuance and sale of the Existing Secured Notes, in each case the use of proceeds therefrom, and the creation of the New Revolving Credit Facility, our total consolidated indebtedness would have been approximately $5.4 billion (none of which would have been subordinated), of which approximately $3.9 billion would have been secured indebtedness. We would also have had $2.1 billion of secured borrowings available under our revolving credit facilities. 6 ----- Our guarantor subsidiaries under our Existing Credit Agreement include our United States subsidiaries other than Younique, LLC (sold in August 2019) and King Kylie, LLC (acquired in January 2020) (the “U.S. Subsidiaries”). For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 and nine months ended March 31, 2021, the U.S. Subsidiaries had net revenues to third parties from continuing operations of $1,234 million and $1,069 million, respectively. In addition, as of June 30, 2020 and March 31, 2021, the U.S. Subsidiaries had Longlived Assets of $3,118 million and $2,979 million, respectively. Long-lived Assets include property and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets. Repurchase of Notes Upon a Change of Control** If we experience specific kinds of change of control Triggering Event ....................................................** triggering events with respect to the Notes, we will be required to offer to repurchase all or part of the Notes at 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but excluding the date of redemption. See “Description of Notes—Repurchase of Notes Upon a Change of Control Triggering Event.” Asset Sales .....................................................................** If the Issuer or its restricted subsidiaries engage in certain asset sales, the Issuer or its restricted subsidiaries generally must either invest the net proceeds from such asset sales in its business within a specific period of time, prepay certain of its or Guarantors’ debt or make an offer to purchase a principal amount of the Notes with the specified excess net proceeds, subject to certain exceptions. The purchase price of the Notes in any such offer will be 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the repurchase date. See “Description of Notes —Certain Covenants—Asset Sales.” Certain Covenants ........................................................** The Notes will be issued under an indenture (the “Indenture”) that contains covenants that, among other things, limit the Issuer’s ability, and the ability of its restricted subsidiaries, to: - incur additional indebtedness, guarantee indebtedness or issue disqualified stock or, in the case of such subsidiaries, preferred stock; - pay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect of their capital stock or make other restricted payments; - make certain investments or acquisitions; - sell, transfer or otherwise convey certain assets; - create liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions; 7 ----- - enter into agreements restricting certain subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany transfers; - consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries; - enter into certain transactions with affiliates; and - prepay certain kinds of indebtedness. The covenants will be subject to a number of exceptions and qualifications. For more details, see “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants.” In addition, most of these covenants will be suspended if the Notes have investment grade ratings from at least two of Moody’s, S&P and Fitch and no default has occurred and is continuing.

92_2,Offerings 2021.md,1236,SUMMARY HISTORICAL CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION,1236.9,Non-GAAP Financial Measures,1236.9.1,,"To supplement the financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, we use non-GAAP financial measures including free cash flow, adjusted operating income, adjusted EBITDA and covenant adjusted EBITDA. See the applicable discussion below for the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures reported in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all the items associated with the operations of the business as determined in accordance with GAAP. Other companies, including companies in the beauty industry, may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes. Despite the limitations of these non-GAAP financial measures, our management uses them as key metrics in the evaluation of our performance and annual budgets and to benchmark performance of our business against our competitors. The following are examples of how these non-GAAP financial measures are utilized by our management: (i) for strategic plans and preparing annual budgets, (ii) senior management receives a monthly analysis comparing budget to actual operating results that is prepared using the non-GAAP financial measures and (iii) senior management’s annual compensation is calculated, in part, by using some of the non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that the non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in their assessment of our operating performance and the valuation of the Company. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures address questions we routinely receive from analysts and investors and, in order to ensure that all investors have access to the same data, we have determined that it is appropriate to make this data available to all investors. The non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of certain items (as further described below) and provide supplemental information regarding our operating performance. By disclosing these non-GAAP financial measures, we intend to provide investors with a supplemental comparison of our operating results and trends for the periods presented. We believe these measures are also useful to investors as such measures allow investors to evaluate our performance using the same metrics that our management uses to evaluate past performance and prospects for future performance. We provide disclosure of the effects of these non-GAAP financial measures by presenting the corresponding measure prepared in conformity with GAAP in our financial statements, and by providing a reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP measures so that investors may understand the adjustments made in arriving at the non-GAAP financial measures and use the information to perform their own analyses. Adjusted operating income from continuing operations excludes restructuring costs and business structure realignment programs, amortization, acquisition- and divestiture-related costs and acquisition accounting impacts, asset impairment charges and other adjustments as described below. We do not consider these items to be reflective of our core operating performance due to the variability of such items from period-to-period in terms of size, nature and significance. They are primarily incurred to realign our operating structure and integrate new acquisitions, and exclude divestitures, and fluctuate based on specific facts and circumstances. Additionally, adjusted net income attributable to Coty Inc. and adjusted net income attributable to Coty Inc. per common share are adjusted for certain interest and other (income) expense as described below and the related tax effects of each of the items used to derive adjusted net income as such charges are not used by our management in assessing our operating performance periodto-period. Non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on the following items: - Costs related to acquisition and divestiture activities: We have excluded acquisition- and divestiture-related costs and the accounting impacts such as those related to transaction costs and costs associated with the revaluation of acquired inventory in connection with business combinations because these costs are unique to each transaction. Additionally, for divestitures, we exclude write-offs of assets that are no longer recoverable and contract related costs due to the divestiture. The nature and amount of such costs vary significantly based on the size and timing of the acquisitions and divestitures, and the maturities of the businesses being acquired or divested. Also, the size, complexity and/or volume of past transactions, which 12 ----- often drives the magnitude of such expenses, may not be indicative of size, complexity and/or volume of any future acquisitions or divestitures. - Restructuring and other business realignment costs: We have excluded costs associated with restructuring and business structure realignment programs to allow for comparable financial results to historical operations and forward-looking guidance. In addition, the nature and amount of such charges vary significantly based on the size and timing of the programs. By excluding the referenced expenses from our non-GAAP financial measures, we are able to further evaluate our ability to utilize existing assets and estimate their long-term value. Furthermore, we believe that the adjustment of these items supplement the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance - Asset impairment charges: We have excluded the impact of asset impairments as such non-cash amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and/or size of acquisitions. Our management believes that the adjustment of these items supplement the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance. - Amortization Expense: We have excluded the impact of amortization of finite-lived intangible assets, as such non-cash amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and/or size of acquisitions. We believe that the adjustment of these items supplement the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance. Although we exclude amortization of intangible assets from our non-GAAP expenses, we believe that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets contribute to revenue generation. Amortization of intangible assets that relate to past acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized. Any future acquisitions may result in the amortization of additional intangible assets. - Loss/(Gain) on divestitures and sale of brand assets: We have excluded the impact of Loss/(gain) on divestitures and sale of brand assets as such amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the size of divestitures. We believe that the adjustment of these items supplement the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance. - Interest (income) expense: We have excluded foreign currency impacts associated with acquisition-related and debt financing-related forward contracts, as well as debt financing transaction costs as the nature and amount of such charges are not consistent and are significantly impacted by the timing and size of such transactions. - Other expense (income): We have excluded the impact of costs incurred for legal and advisory services rendered in connection with the tender offer that was in fiscal 2019 initiated by certain of our shareholders. Additionally, we have excluded the write-off of deferred financing fees and discounts that resulted from the pay down of our term debt from the proceeds of the sale of the Wella Business, due to the requirements of the Existing Credit Agreement (as defined below). We believe these costs do not reflect our underlying ongoing business, and the adjustment of such costs helps investors and others compare and analyze performance from period to period. We have also excluded the impact of pension curtailment (gains) and losses and pension settlement as such events are triggered by our restructuring and other business realignment activities and the amount of such charges vary significantly based on the size and timing of the programs. Further, we have excluded the change in fair value of the investment in Wella, as our management believes these unrealized (gains) and losses do not reflect our underlying ongoing business, and the adjustment of such impact helps investors and others compare and analyze performance from period to period. - Loss on early extinguishment of debt: We have excluded loss on extinguishment of debt as this represents a non-cash charge, and the amount and frequency of such charges is not consistent and is significantly impacted by the timing and size of debt financing transactions. - Noncontrolling interest: This adjustment represents the after-tax impact of the non-GAAP adjustments included in Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests based on the relevant non-controlling interest percentage. 13 ----- - Tax: This adjustment represents the impact of the tax effect of the pretax items excluded from adjusted net income. The tax impact of the non-GAAP adjustments is based on the tax rates related to the jurisdiction in which the adjusted items are received or incurred. Additionally, adjustments are made for the tax impact of any intra-entity transfer of assets and liabilities. While acquiring brands and licenses comprises a part of our overall growth strategy, along with targeting organic growth opportunities, we have excluded acquisition-related costs and acquisition accounting impacts in connection with business combinations because these costs are unique to each transaction and the amount and frequency are not consistent and are significantly impacted by the timing and size of our acquisitions. We assess the success of an acquisition as a component of performance using a variety of indicators depending on the size and nature of the acquisition, including: - The scale of the combined company be evaluating consolidated and segment financial metrics; - The expansion of product offerings by evaluating segment, brand and geographic performance and the respective strength of the brands; - The evaluation of share expansion in categories and geographies; - The earnings per share accretion and substantial incremental free cash flow generation providing financial flexibility for us; and - The comparison of actual and projected results, including achievement of projected synergies, post integration; provided that timing for any such comparison will depend on the size and complexity of the acquisition.",N/A,as_expected,2021,148

While the Existing Credit Facilities and the Secured Notes Indenture and the Unsecured Notes Indenture permit, and Indenture will permit covenant adjusted EBITDA to be calculated inclusive of potential synergies and estimated EBITDA from acquired entities, the inclusion of such synergies and EBITDA should not be viewed as a projection of future results, but is simply provided to permit investors to understand how covenant adjusted EBITDA is calculated under these debt instruments. (7) Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. We are presenting free cash flow to provide investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt repayment and other strategic measures, as well as to provide them with the same measure that management considers when making resource allocation decisions.

Our business has been, and may continue to be, negatively impacted by the fear of exposure to or actual effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in countries where we operate or our customers are located, such as reduced travel or recommendations or mandates from governmental authorities to avoid large gatherings or to self-quarantine, as well as temporary closures of our facilities or the facilities of our customers or suppliers. Easing of containment measures and recovery of the impacted sectors of the economy has been, and may continue to be, gradual and uneven, as regions face resurgence of COVID-19 and related uncertainties, and the availability and widespread distribution of a safe and effective vaccine varies across regions. The impacts include, but are not limited to: significant reductions in demand or significant volatility in demand for one or more of our products, which may be caused by, among other things, the temporary inability of consumers to purchase our products due to illness, quarantine or other travel restrictions, store closures, or financial hardship, shifts in demand away from one or more of our discretionary or higher priced products to lower priced products, or stockpiling or similar activity, supply chain and shipping constraints, reduced options for marketing and promotion of products or other restrictions in connection with COVID-19; if prolonged, such impacts can further increase the difficulty of operating our business, including accurately planning and forecasting, and may adversely impact our results; the inability to meet our customers’ needs and achieve costs targets due to disruptions in our manufacturing and supply arrangements caused by the loss or disruption of essential manufacturing and supply elements such as raw materials or other finished product components, transportation, workforce, or other manufacturing and distribution capability, or the allocation of manufacturing capacity towards medical supplies such as hydro-alcoholic gel (which is used in hand sanitizer); failure of third parties on which we rely, including our suppliers, our customers, contract manufacturers, distributors, contractors, commercial banks, joint venture partners and external business partners, to meet their obligations to the Company or to timely meet those obligations, or significant disruptions in their ability to do so, which may be caused by their own financial or operational difficulties and may adversely impact our operations; or significant changes in the political conditions in markets in which we manufacture, sell or distribute our products, including quarantines, governmental or regulatory actions, closures or other restrictions that limit or close our operating and manufacturing facilities, restrict our employees’ ability to travel or perform necessary business functions, restrict or prevent consumers from having access to our products, or otherwise prevent our third-party partners, suppliers, or customers from sufficiently staffing operations, including operations necessary for the production, distribution, sale and support of our products, which could adversely impact our results. These impacts have had and could continue to have a negative effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, as well as the trading price of our securities, and the duration and extent to which our future results of operations and overall financial performance will be impacted remains uncertain. In light of the adverse impact on our near-term revenues, earnings, liquidity and cash flows, we have taken and expect to continue to implement measures to reduce discretionary expenses and manage costs. These measures may not achieve results in accordance with our expectations or on the timelines we anticipate. Despite our efforts to manage and remedy these impacts to the Company, their ultimate impact also depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control, including the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as third-party actions taken to contain its spread and mitigate its public health effects. 18 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,148
92_2,Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.2,Risks Relating to this Offering and the Notes,13.2.1,,"_We have taken on significant debt, which may adversely affect our business._ We have a substantial amount of indebtedness. As of March 31, 2021, after giving effect to the offering of the Notes offered hereby, the issuance and sale of the Existing Secured Notes, in each case the use of proceeds therefrom, and the creation of the New Revolving Credit Facility, our total consolidated indebtedness would have been approximately $5.4 billion, all of which we will need to refinance or repay. We would also have had $0.7 billion of secured borrowings drawn under our revolving credit facilities. There can be no assurances we will be able to refinance our indebtedness in the future (1) on commercially reasonable terms, (2) on terms, including with respect to interest rates, as favorable as our current debt or (3) at all. Our debt burden could have important consequences, including increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry; requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of any cash flow from operations to the payment of principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to fund our operations, growth strategy, working capital, capital expenditures, future business opportunities and other general corporate purposes; exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates with respect to any borrowings that are at variable rates of interest; restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures; limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, research and development, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; limiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions; and placing us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors who are less highly leveraged. In addition, a significant portion of our cash and investments are held outside the United States, and we may not be able to service our debt without undergoing the costs of repatriating those funds. _The instruments that govern, or will govern, our debt contain, or will contain, various covenants that impose restrictions on us that may affect our ability to operate our business._ Instruments that govern, or will govern, our indebtedness, including the Existing Credit Agreement, the indenture governing the Existing Unsecured Notes (the “Unsecured Notes Indenture”), the indenture governing the Existing Secured Notes (the “Secured Notes Indenture”) and the Indenture, impose or will impose operating and financial restrictions on our activities. These restrictions limit or prohibit our ability and the ability of us and our restricted subsidiaries to, among other things: - incur indebtedness or grant liens on our property to secure indebtedness; - dispose of assets or equity; - make acquisitions or investments; - make dividends, distributions or other restricted payments; - effect affiliate transactions; - enter into sale and leaseback transactions; and - enter into mergers, consolidations or sales of substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries. In addition, the Existing Credit Agreement includes a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a total net leverage ratio (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement) equal to or less than certain levels set forth in the Existing Credit Agreement. These restrictions on our ability to operate our business could seriously harm our business by, among other things, limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, merger and acquisition and other corporate opportunities. Further, various risks, uncertainties and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with these covenants. Failure to comply with any of the covenants in our financing agreements could result in an event of default under those agreements and under any other agreements containing cross-default provisions. Such an event of default, if not waived or cured, would permit lenders to accelerate the maturity of the debt under these agreements and to 19 ----- foreclose upon any collateral securing the debt (including the Collateral securing the Notes offered hereby, the Existing Secured Notes and the Existing Credit Facilities). Under these circumstances, we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations, including our obligations under the Existing Credit Agreement. the Unsecured Notes Indenture, the Secured Notes Indenture and the Indenture. In addition, the limitations imposed by financing agreements on our ability to incur additional debt and to take other actions might significantly impair our ability to obtain other financing. We cannot assure you that we will be granted waivers or amendments to these agreements if for any reason we are unable to comply with these agreements or that we will be able to refinance our debt on terms acceptable to us, or at all. _If we default on our obligations under our other indebtedness, we may not be able to make payments on the Notes._ Any default under the agreements governing our indebtedness, including a default under the Indenture, the Existing Credit Agreement, the Unsecured Notes Indenture or the Secured Notes Indenture that is not waived by the required percentage of noteholders or lenders, as applicable, could impede our ability to pay principal and premium amounts, if any, and interest on the Notes and substantially decrease the market value of the Notes. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow and are otherwise unable to obtain funds necessary to meet required payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, or if we otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants, including financial and operating covenants, in the agreements governing our indebtedness, we could be in default under the terms of the agreements governing such indebtedness. In the event of such a default, the holders of such indebtedness in the applicable required percentage could elect to declare all the funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, lenders under our revolving credit facilities in the applicable required percentage could elect to terminate their commitments and lenders under the Existing Credit Facilities and the holders of the Notes offered hereby and the Existing Notes in the applicable required percentage could institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets that constitute the Collateral, and we may seek protection under the bankruptcy code. If we breach our covenants under the Indenture, the Existing Credit Agreement, the Unsecured Notes Indenture, the Secured Notes Indenture or under any agreements governing future senior credit facilities or other indebtedness, we may need to request waivers from the required percentage of lenders or required percentage of noteholders to avoid being in default. If we are unable to obtain a waiver from the lenders or noteholders, we would be in default under the instrument governing that indebtedness, the lenders or noteholders could exercise their rights as described above, and we may seek protection under the bankruptcy code. _Our ability to service and repay the Notes will be dependent on the cash flow generated by our subsidiaries and events beyond our control._ The Issuer’s only material asset is its interest in its subsidiaries. The Issuer conducts its operations through, and most of its assets are owned by, its subsidiaries, and its operating income and cash flow are generated by its subsidiaries. As a result, repayment of the Notes will depend on our subsidiaries’ generation of cash flow, which will, in turn, depend principally upon future operating performance, and our subsidiaries’ ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. If our operating subsidiaries experience sufficiently adverse changes in its financial position or results of operations, or we otherwise become unable to pay our debts as they become due and obtain further credit, this could result in the commencement of insolvency proceedings. Any such proceedings would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, will affect our ability to make payments on our debt. In particular, due to the seasonal nature of the beauty industry, with the highest levels of consumer demand generally occurring during the holiday buying season in our second fiscal quarter, our subsidiaries’ cash flow in the second half of the fiscal year may be less than in the first half of the fiscal year, which may affect our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations, including to service the Notes offered hereby. In addition, we earn a significant amount of our operating income, and hold a significant portion of our cash and investments, in our foreign subsidiaries outside the United States. As of March 31, 2021, the amount of cash and cash equivalents held outside of the United States by our foreign subsidiaries was $258.3 million. If our U.S. subsidiaries are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations, including to service the Notes offered hereby, we may need to repatriate additional earnings and we may be subject to a higher effective tax rate. If we do not generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations, including payments on the Notes, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as refinancing or restructuring our debt, selling assets, reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital. Our ability to restructure or refinance 20 ----- our debt will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could result in higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of the Indenture, the Existing Credit Agreement, the Unsecured Notes Indenture, the Secured Notes Indenture or any existing debt instruments or future debt instruments that we may enter into may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. The inability of our subsidiaries to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations, including the inability to service the Notes offered hereby, or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, profitability, cash flows or liquidity financial and may impact our ability to satisfy our obligations in respect of the Notes. _We may incur substantially more debt, including secured debt, or take other actions that may affect our ability to satisfy our obligations under the Notes._ Although the terms of the Indenture will restrict, and the terms of the Existing Credit Agreement, the Unsecured Notes Indenture and Secured Notes Indenture restrict, our and our subsidiaries’ ability to incur additional indebtedness and liens securing indebtedness, such restrictions are subject to several exceptions and qualifications. Accordingly, we will be able to incur additional indebtedness, including secured debt, as permitted by the terms of the Indenture, the Existing Credit Agreement, the Unsecured Notes Indenture and the Secured Notes Indenture. Such additional indebtedness may be substantial. Our ability to recapitalize, incur additional debt and take a number of other actions that are not prohibited by the terms of the Indenture, the Existing Credit Agreement, the Unsecured Notes Indenture and the Secured Notes Indenture could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on the Notes when due, and may also require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our other indebtedness, which would reduce the availability of cash flow to fund our operations, working capital and capital expenditures. In addition, if we incur any additional indebtedness that ranks pari passu in right of payment to the Notes, the holders of that debt will be able to share ratably with the holders of such series of the Notes in any proceeds distributed in connection with any insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding up of us. If our subsidiaries that are not guaranteeing the Notes incur any indebtedness, all of such debt will be structurally senior to the Notes, and the holders of that debt will benefit prior to the holders of the Notes in any proceeds distributed in connection with any insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding up of any such entity. _Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase._ Borrowings under our Existing Credit Facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. As of March 31, 2021, after giving effect to the offering of the Notes offered hereby, the issuance and sale of the Existing Secured Notes, in each case the use of proceeds therefrom and the creation of the New Revolving Credit Facility, $1.0 billion, or approximately 18% of our total debt, would have been at variable rates of interest. We would also have had $2.1 billion of secured borrowings available under our revolving credit facilities. If interest rates were to increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness referred to above would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease. For every 10% increase or decrease in our interest rates, our (Loss) income before income taxes for the twelve month period ended March 31, 2021 would have changed by approximately $3.4 million, assuming that all other variables stayed the same. We are currently party to, and in the future, we may enter into additional, interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments, in order to reduce interest rate volatility. However, we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness, and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk. _Our credit ratings may not reflect the risks of investing in the Notes._ Our credit ratings are an assessment by rating agencies of our ability to pay our debts when due and include many subjective factors. Consequently, real or anticipated changes in our credit ratings will generally affect the value of the Notes. Also, these credit ratings may not reflect the potential impact of risks relating to structure or marketing of the Notes. Agency ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any security and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the issuing organization. Each agency’s rating should be evaluated independently of any other agency’s rating. There can be no assurance that our credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency, if, in that rating agency’s judgment, circumstances so warrant. There can also be no assurance that our credit ratings will reflect all of the factors that would be important to holders of the Notes. Actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any 21 ----- announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade, could affect the value of the Notes, may increase our borrowing costs and may negatively impact our ability to incur additional debt. The reports of the rating agencies do not form a part of, and are not incorporated by reference into, this offering memorandum. _Redemption may adversely affect your return on the Notes._ The Notes are redeemable at our option, and therefore we may choose to redeem the Notes at times when prevailing interest rates are relatively low. As a result, you may not be able to reinvest the proceeds you receive from the redemption in a comparable security at an effective interest rate as high as the interest rate on your Notes being redeemed. _We may not be able to purchase the Notes upon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event, which would result in a default under the Indenture and would adversely affect our business and financial condition._ Upon the occurrence of a “Change of Control Triggering Event” within the meaning of the Indenture with respect to the Notes, we will be required to repurchase all or any part of such holder’s Notes of such series at 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but excluding the purchase date. We may not have sufficient funds available to make any required repurchases of the Notes, and we may be unable to receive distributions or advances from our subsidiaries in the future sufficient to meet such repurchase obligation. In addition, a change of control triggering event may also accelerate obligations to repurchase amounts outstanding under our and our subsidiaries’ indebtedness and require us (or our subsidiaries), among other things, to make similar offerings in respect of our and their outstanding indebtedness. In addition, restrictions under future debt instruments may not permit us to repurchase the Notes. If we fail to repurchase the Notes in that circumstance, we will be in default under the Indenture. If, due to a default, the repayment of related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay such indebtedness or the Notes. See “Description of Notes—Repurchase of Notes Upon a Change of Control Triggering Event.” _Some significant restructuring transactions may not constitute a change of control triggering event, in which case we would not be obligated to offer to purchase the affected Notes._ Upon the occurrence of a “Change of Control Triggering Event” within the meaning of the Indenture with respect to the Notes, holders of the Notes have the right to require us to purchase their Notes. However, the “Change of Control Triggering Event” provisions will not afford protection to holders of Notes in the event of certain transactions. For example, transactions such as leveraged recapitalizations, refinancings, restructurings or acquisitions initiated by us may not constitute a “Change of Control Triggering Event” requiring us to purchase the Notes. Further, various transactions might not constitute a “Change of Control Triggering Event” under the Notes but could constitute a change of control triggering event as defined under our other debt. In the event of any such transaction, the holders would not have the right to require us to purchase the Notes, even though such transaction could increase the amount of our indebtedness, or otherwise adversely affect our capital structure or any credit ratings, thereby adversely affecting the holders of Notes. _The ability of holders of the Notes to require us to repurchase the Notes as a result of a disposition of “substantially all” assets may be uncertain._ The definition of “Change of Control Triggering Event” in the Indenture will include a phrase relating to sale, lease, transfer or other conveyance, in one or a series of related transactions, of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of the Notes to require us to repurchase such Notes as a result of a sale, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of less than all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries taken as a whole to another person or group may be uncertain. _Many of the covenants in the Indenture will not apply to us if the Notes have investment grade ratings from at least two of Moody’s, S&P and Fitch and no default has occurred and is continuing._ Many of the covenants in the Indenture will not apply to us if the Notes have investment grade ratings from at least two of Moody’s, S&P and Fitch and no default has occurred and is continuing. There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever be rated investment grade, or that if they are rated investment grade, that the Notes will maintain 22 ----- these ratings. However, suspension of these covenants would allow us to engage in certain transactions that would not be permitted while these covenants were in effect. To the extent the covenants are subsequently reinstated, any such actions taken while the covenants were suspended would not result in an event of default under the Indenture. See “Description of Notes—Covenant Suspension.” _A trading market for the Notes may not develop._ The Notes are a new issue of securities for which there currently is no market. In addition, the Notes are subject to certain restrictions on resale and transfer as described under “Transfer Restrictions.” We intend to apply for the listing of and permission to deal in the Notes on the Official List of TISE. However, we cannot guarantee that the application to list the Notes on the Official List of TISE will be approved as of the issue date or any date thereafter, that the permission to deal in the Notes will be granted or that the listing of the Notes will be maintained, and settlement of the Notes is not conditioned on obtaining this listing. TISE is not a regulated market for the purposes of MiFID II. The initial purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by applicable law. They are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes and any market-making may be discontinued at any time at their sole discretion. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the development or liquidity of any market for the Notes. If a market develops, the Notes could trade at prices that may be lower than the initial offering price of the Notes. Further, if an active market does not develop or is not maintained, the price and liquidity of the Notes may be adversely affected. Historically, debt markets have been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. The market, if any, for the Notes may not be free from similar disruptions, and any such disruptions may adversely affect the prices at which holders of the Notes may sell their Notes. In addition, subsequent to their initial issuance, the Notes may trade at a discount from their initial offering price, depending upon prevailing interest rates, the market for similar notes, our performance and other factors. _Not all of our subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes, and your right to receive payment on the Notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of our non-guarantor subsidiaries._ Not all of our subsidiaries will be required to guarantee the Notes. The Notes will be guaranteed by the Issuer and the Guarantors, which do not include foreign subsidiaries and certain U.S. subsidiaries excepted from providing guarantees under the terms of the Existing Credit Agreement. Creditors of our non-guarantor subsidiaries will generally be entitled to payment from the assets of those subsidiaries before those assets can be distributed for the benefit of noteholders. As a result, the Notes will be structurally subordinated to the prior payment of all of the existing and future debt and other liabilities of our non-guarantor subsidiaries. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any of our non-guarantor subsidiaries, holders of their indebtedness will generally be entitled to payment of their claims from the assets of those subsidiaries before any assets are made available for distribution to the Issuer or the Guarantors of the Notes. Our guarantor subsidiaries, under our Existing Credit Agreement, include our United States subsidiaries other than Younique, LLC (sold in August 2019) and King Kylie, LLC (acquired in January 2020). For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 and nine months ended March 31, 2021, the U.S. Subsidiaries had net revenues to third parties from continuing operations of $1,234 million and $1,069 million, respectively. In addition, as of June 30, 2020 and March 31, 2021, the U.S. Subsidiaries had Long-lived Assets of $3,118 million and $2,979 million, respectively. Long-lived Assets include property and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets. Unless they are Guarantors, our subsidiaries will not have any obligation to pay amounts due on the Notes or to make funds available for that purpose. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions or debt repayments to enable us to make payments in respect of the Notes. Each such subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and may be subject to legal or contractual restrictions that, under certain circumstances, may limit our ability to obtain cash from them. In the event that we do not receive sufficient cash from our subsidiaries, we will be unable to make required principal, premium, if any, and interest payments on the Notes. _There are restrictions on your ability to transfer or resell the Notes. In addition, holders of the Notes will not be entitled to registration rights, and we do not currently intend to register the Notes under applicable securities laws._ The Notes are being offered and sold pursuant to exemptions from registration under the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. Therefore, you may transfer or resell the Notes in the United States only in a transaction registered under or exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws, and you may be required to bear the risk of your investment for an indefinite period of time. You may 23 ----- not offer or sell the Notes except under an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act, and we do not intend to register the Notes for resale or to offer to exchange the Notes for registered notes under the Securities Act. By purchasing the Notes, you will be deemed to have made certain acknowledgements, representations and agreements as set forth under “Transfer Restrictions.” _Federal and state statutes allow courts, under specific circumstances, to avoid the Notes and the guarantees, to require holders of the Notes to return payments received from us or the Guarantors, and to take other actions detrimental to the holders of the Notes._ Federal and state fraudulent transfer and conveyance statutes may apply to the issuance of the Notes, the delivery of any guarantees of the Notes, including the guarantees by the Guarantors entered into upon issuance of the Notes, and any subsidiary guarantees that may be entered into thereafter under the terms of the Indenture. Under federal bankruptcy law and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer or conveyance laws, which may vary from state to state, the issuance of the Notes and the delivery of guarantees could be avoided (that is, canceled) as fraudulent transfers or conveyances if a court determined that we, at the time we issued the Notes, or any of the Guarantors, at the time it delivered the applicable guarantee (or, in some jurisdictions, at the time payment became due under the Notes or a guarantee), (I) issued the Notes or provided the applicable guarantee, as the case may be, with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding any present or future creditor; or (II) (A) received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for issuing the Notes or providing such guarantee, as the case may be, and (B) (1) was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such issuance or provision, (2) was engaged in a business or transaction for which the Issuer’s or such Guarantor’s remaining assets constituted unreasonably small capital, or (3) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they matured. A court would likely find that the Issuer or a Guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the Notes or the applicable guarantee if the Issuer or such Guarantor did not benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the Notes or such guarantee. As a general matter, subject to the standards noted above, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or obligation, property is transferred or an antecedent debt is secured or satisfied. If the Notes or guarantees are avoided or limited under fraudulent transfer or other laws, any claim you may make against the Issuer or the Guarantors for amounts payable on the Notes or guarantees, as the case may be, will be unenforceable to the extent of such avoidance or limitation. We cannot be certain as to the standards a court would use to determine whether the Issuer or a Guarantor was solvent at the relevant time that, if applicable in a particular jurisdiction, may be when payment became due under the Notes or a guarantee. Regardless of the actual standard applied by the court, we cannot be certain that the issuance of the Notes or a guarantee would not be avoided. The measures of insolvency for purposes of these fraudulent transfer laws will vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding to determine whether a fraudulent transfer has occurred. Generally, however, the Issuer or a Guarantor would be considered insolvent if: - the sum of its debts, including contingent and unliquidated liabilities, was greater than the value of its property, at a fair valuation; - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or - it could not pay its debts as they become due. To the extent that a court avoids or otherwise finds the Notes or a guarantee unenforceable for any other reason, your claims against the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor would be eliminated or limited. In addition, the court might 24 ----- direct you to repay any amounts already received from the Issuer or such Guarantor. Further, the avoidance of the Notes or a related guarantee could result in an event of default with respect to our other debt that, in turn, could result in acceleration of such debt. In certain circumstances, a court may subordinate claims in respect of the Notes or a guarantee to all other debts of an Issuer or a Guarantor, or take other actions detrimental to the noteholders, based on equitable or other grounds. We cannot be certain as to the standards that a court might apply and whether it might find such subordination or other actions appropriate. If a guarantee were legally challenged, such guarantee could also be subject to the claim that, since the guarantee was incurred for the Issuer’s benefit, and only indirectly for the benefit of the Guarantor, the obligations of the Guarantor were incurred for less than fair consideration. A court could thus avoid the obligations under the guarantee. Although each guarantee will contain a provision intended to limit that Guarantor’s liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its guarantee to be a fraudulent transfer, that provision may not be effective to protect those guarantees from being avoided under fraudulent transfer law, or may reduce that Guarantor’s obligation to an amount that effectively makes its guarantee worthless. Even if the guarantees of the Notes remain in force, the remaining amount due and collectible under the guarantee may not be sufficient to pay the Notes in full when due. _Because each Guarantor’s liability under its guarantees may be reduced to zero, avoided or released under certain circumstances, you may not receive any payments from some or all of the Guarantors._ You have the benefit of the guarantees of the Guarantors. However, the guarantees by the Guarantors are limited to the maximum amount that the Guarantors are permitted to guarantee under applicable law. As a result, a Guarantor’s liability under its guarantee could be reduced to zero, depending on the amount of other obligations of such Guarantor. Further, under the circumstances discussed more fully above, a court under Federal or state fraudulent conveyance and transfer statutes could void the obligations under a guarantee or further subordinate it to all other obligations of the Guarantor. In addition, you will lose the benefit of a particular guarantee if it is released under certain circumstances described under “Description of Notes—Guarantees.” _Holders of the Notes may be subject to the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, as well as possible exchange controls, relating to the U.S. dollar and the euro._ The initial investors in the Notes will be required to pay for the Notes in euro. Neither we nor the initial purchasers will be obligated to assist the initial investors in obtaining euro or in converting other currencies into euro to facilitate the payment of the purchase price for the Notes. An investment in any security denominated in, and all payments with respect to which are to be made in, a currency other than the currency of the country in which an investor in the Notes resides or the currency in which an investor conducts its business or activities (the “investor’s home currency”), entails significant risks not associated with a similar investment in a security denominated in the investor’s home currency. In the case of the Notes offered hereby, these risks may include the possibility of: - significant changes in rates of exchange between the euro and the investor’s home currency; and - the imposition or modification of foreign exchange controls with respect to the euro or the investor’s home currency. We have no control over a number of factors affecting the Notes offered hereby and foreign exchange rates, including economic, financial and political events that are important in determining the existence, magnitude and longevity of these risks and their effects. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates between two currencies result from the interaction over time of many factors directly or indirectly affecting economic and political conditions in the countries issuing such currencies, and economic and political developments globally and in other relevant countries. Foreign currency exchange rates may be affected by, among other factors, existing and expected rates of inflation, existing and expected interest rate levels, the balance of payments between countries, and the extent of the governmental surpluses or deficits in various countries. All of these factors are, in turn, sensitive to the monetary, fiscal and trade policies pursued by the governments of various countries important to international trade and finance. Moreover, the recent global economic volatility and the actions taken or to be taken by various national governments 25 ----- in response to the volatility could significantly affect the exchange rates between the euro and the investor’s home currency. The exchange rate of an investor’s home currency for euro and the fluctuations in the exchange rate that have occurred in the past are not necessarily indicative of the exchange rates or the fluctuations therein that may occur in the future. Depreciation of the euro against the investor’s home currency would result in a decrease in the investor’s home currency equivalent yield on a Note, in the investor’s home currency equivalent of the principal payable at the maturity of that Note and generally in the investor’s home currency equivalent market value of that Note. Appreciation of the euro in relation to the investor’s home currency would have the opposite effects. The European Union or one or more of its member states may, in the future, impose exchange controls and modify any exchange controls imposed, which controls could affect exchange rates, as well as the availability of the euro at the time of payment of principal of, interest on, or any redemption or additional amounts with respect to, the Notes. This description of foreign exchange risks does not describe all the risks of an investment in securities, including, in particular, the Notes, that are denominated or payable in a currency other than an investor’s home currency. You should consult your own financial and legal advisors as to the risks involved in an investment in the Notes. _Trading in the clearing system is subject to minimum denomination requirements._ The Notes will be issued with a minimum denomination of €100,000 and multiple of €1,000 in excess of €100,000. It is possible that the clearing systems may process trades that could result in amounts being held in denominations smaller than the minimum denominations. If definitive Notes are required to be issued in relation to such Notes in accordance with the provisions of the relevant global notes, a holder who does not have the minimum denomination or a multiple of €1,000 in excess of €100,000, as applicable, in its account with the relevant clearing stem at the relevant time may not receive all of its entitlement in the form of definitive Notes unless and until such time as its holding satisfies the minimum denomination requirement. _In a lawsuit for payment on the Notes, an investor may bear currency exchange risk._ The Notes will be governed by New York law. Under New York law, a New York state court rendering a judgment on the Notes would be required to render the judgment in euro. However, the judgment would be converted into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of entry of the judgment. Consequently, in a lawsuit for payment on the Notes, investors would bear currency exchange risk until a New York state court judgment is entered, which could be a long time from the date the judgment is rendered. In courts outside of New York, investors may not be able to obtain a judgment in a currency other than U.S. dollars. For example, a judgment for money in an action based on the Notes in many other U.S. federal or state courts ordinarily would be enforced in the United States only in U.S. dollars. The date used to determine the rate of conversion of euro into U.S. dollars will depend upon various factors, including which court renders the judgment. _The Notes permit us to make payments in U.S. dollars if we are unable to obtain euro._ We will pay the principal of and interest on each Note to the registered holder in euro in immediately available funds, provided that, if on or after the issuance of the Notes, the euro is unavailable to us due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond our control or if the euro is no longer being used by the then-member states of the European Monetary Union that have adopted the euro as their currency or for the settlement of transactions by public institutions of or within the international banking community, then all payments in respect of the Notes will be made in U.S. dollars until the euro is again available to us or so used. In such circumstances, the amount payable on any date in euro will be converted into U.S. dollars at the rate mandated by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board as the close of business on the second business day prior to the relevant payment date or, in the event of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board has not mandated a rate of conversion, on the basis of the then-most recent U.S. dollar/euro exchange rate available on or prior to the second business day prior to the relevant payment date as determined by us in our sole discretion. Any payment in respect of the Notes so made in U.S. dollars will not constitute an event of default under the Notes or the Indenture. See “Description of Notes—Terms of the Notes.” This exchange rate may be materially less favorable than the rate in effect at the time the Notes were issued or as would be determined by applicable law. Such developments, or market perceptions concerning these and related issues, could materially adversely affect the value of the Notes and you may lose a significant amount of your investment in the Notes. 26 ----- _Certain considerations relating to book-entry interests._ The Notes will initially only be issued in global certificated form and held through Euroclear and Clearstream. Interests in the Global Notes (as such term is defined in “Book-Entry, Settlement and Clearance”) will trade in bookentry form only. Unless and until the Notes in definitive registered form are issued in exchange for book-entry interests, owners of book-entry interests will not be considered owners or holders of the Notes. The common depositary (or its nominee) for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream will be the registered holder of the Global Notes. Payments in respect of the Global Notes representing the Notes (including principal, premium, interest and additional amounts, if any) will be made to the paying agent. The paying agent will then make such payments to the common depositary (or its nominee) for Euroclear and Clearstream. The common depositary (or its nominee) will in turn distribute such payments to participants in accordance with its procedures. After payment to the common depositary (or its nominee), we, the Trustee and the paying agent will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly, if you own a book-entry interest, you must rely on the procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, and if you are not a participant in Euroclear or Clearstream, on the procedures of the participant through which you own your interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of notes under the Indenture. See “Book-Entry, Settlement and Clearance.” Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right to act upon our solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes. Instead, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be permitted to act only to the extent you have received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear or Clearstream or, if applicable, a participant. There can be no assurance that procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies will be sufficient to enable you to vote on any request actions on a timely basis. Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture, unless and until notes in definitive registered form are issued in respect of all book entry interests, if you own a book entry interest, you will be restricted to acting through Euroclear or Clearstream. We, the Trustee and the paying agent cannot assure you that the procedures to be implemented through Euroclear or Clearstream will be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of rights under the Notes. See “Book-Entry, Settlement and Clearance.”",N/A,as_expected,2021,148
92_2,Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.3,Risks related to the Collateral,13.3.1,,"_Even though the holders of the Notes will benefit from a lien on the Collateral that secures our Existing Credit Facilities and the Existing Secured Notes, the representative of the lenders under our Existing Credit Agreement initially controls actions with respect to the Collateral. If required to do so pursuant to applicable law, the Collateral Agent may release the Collateral securing the Notes automatically, without your consent or the consent of the Trustee._ On the closing date of this offering, the Notes will be secured by liens on the same Collateral that secures our obligations under the Existing Credit Facilities and the Existing Secured Notes. Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, however, the ability to cause the commencement of enforcement proceedings against such Collateral, to control such proceedings and certain decisions in a bankruptcy proceeding will be at the direction of the authorized representative of the lenders under the Existing Credit Agreement governing our Existing Credit Facilities until the expiration of a standstill period. In addition, subject to certain limitations, the Existing Credit Agreement, the Secured Notes Indenture permit, and the Indenture will permit, us to issue up to a certain amount of additional debt that also has a first-priority lien on the same Collateral. At any time that the representative of the lenders under our Existing Credit Agreement does not have the right to take actions with respect to the Collateral pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, that right passes to the authorized representative of the holders of the next largest outstanding principal amount of indebtedness secured by a first-priority lien on the Collateral. Our Existing Credit Facilities will be the largest portion as of the issue date. The authorized representative for such indebtedness would be next in line to exercise rights under the Intercreditor Agreement, rather than the authorized representative for the Notes. Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the authorized representative of the holders of the Notes may not object following the filing of a bankruptcy petition to any debtor-in-possession financing or to the use of any cash collateral to secure that financing, in each case that has been consented to by the representative of the lenders under the Existing Credit Agreement governing the Existing Credit Facilities or the applicable authorized representative, subject to 27 ----- conditions and limited exceptions. After such a filing, the value of this Collateral could materially deteriorate, and the holders of the Notes would be unable to raise an objection. In addition, under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Collateral Agent may be required to release or subordinate liens pursuant to applicable law under a final and nonappealable order or judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, without your consent or the consent of the Trustee. _It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral._ No appraisal of the value of the Collateral securing the Notes has been made in connection with this offering and the fair market value of the Collateral is subject to fluctuations based on factors that include, among others, market and other economic conditions, including the availability of suitable buyers. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. We cannot assure you that the fair market value of the Collateral as of the date of this offering memorandum exceeds, or at any other point in time will exceed, the principal amount of the debt secured thereby. The value of the Collateral and the guarantees could be impaired in the future as a result of changing economic conditions, our failure to implement our business strategy, competition, liabilities and other future events. Accordingly, there may not be sufficient Collateral to pay all or any of the amounts due on the Notes or the other debt secured by first-priority liens on the Collateral, including the obligations under our Existing Credit Agreement and Existing Secured Notes. Any claim for the difference between the amount, if any, realized by holders of the Notes and the other holders of first-priority liens on the Collateral from the sale of the Collateral and the obligations of the Issuer and Guarantors under the Notes will be equal in right of payment with all of our other unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness and other obligations, including trade payables. Additionally, in the event that a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding is commenced by or against us, if the value of the Collateral is less than the amount of principal and accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes and all other pari passu senior secured obligations, interest may cease to accrue on the Notes from and after the date such proceedings are commenced or initiated. Also, any disposition of the Collateral during a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding outside of the ordinary course of our business would require approval from the bankruptcy court (which may not be given under certain circumstances). To the extent that third parties enjoy prior liens on any of the Collateral or are able to attach liens to any of the Collateral, such third parties may have rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral that, if exercised, could adversely affect the value of the Collateral. Additionally, the terms of the Indenture will allow us to (i) issue additional secured indebtedness, including additional debt that may be _pari passu in the Collateral with the Notes, and (ii) to incur refinancing indebtedness in certain circumstances. The Indenture will not require that we maintain the current level of Collateral value or maintain a specific ratio of indebtedness to asset values. Under the Indenture, any such additional secured indebtedness may be pari passu in the Collateral with the Notes and be entitled to the same rights and priority with respect to the Collateral. Thus, the issuance of any such additional debt and refinancing indebtedness may have the effect of significantly diluting your ability to recover payment in full of the Notes from the then-existing pool of Collateral. Releases of Collateral from the liens securing the Notes will be permitted under certain circumstances. See “Description of Notes—Security—Release of Liens.” In the future, the obligation to grant additional security over assets, or a particular type or class of assets, whether as a result of the acquisition or creation of future assets or subsidiaries, the designation of a previously unrestricted subsidiary or otherwise, will be subject to the provisions of the Indenture and the Security Documents (as defined below), including the Intercreditor Agreement. Furthermore, upon enforcement against any Collateral or during a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding, under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the claims of the holders of the Notes to the proceeds thereof will rank equally with the claims of the holders of obligations under the Existing Credit Agreement, the Existing Secured Notes and any other indebtedness that is secured on a first-priority basis by the Collateral. The security interest of the Collateral Agent on behalf of the holders of the Notes is subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests in collateral. For example, the consent of a third party may be necessary to obtain or enforce a security interest in a contract and such consent may not be provided. Also, the consents of any third parties may not necessarily be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure or realization on the Collateral. Accordingly, the Collateral Agent may not have the ability to foreclose or realize upon those assets and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease. 28 ----- _Holders of the Notes may not be able to fully realize the value of their liens._ The security interests and liens for the benefit of holders of the Notes may be released without such holders’ consent in specified circumstances. In particular, the Security Documents generally provide for an automatic release of all liens on any asset securing the Notes, the Existing Secured Notes or our Existing Credit Facilities on a firstpriority basis that is disposed of in compliance with the provisions of the Existing Credit Agreement governing our Existing Credit Facilities, the Secured Notes Indenture and the Indenture. As a result, we cannot assure holders of the Notes that the Notes will continue to be secured by a substantial portion of our assets. Moreover, the Collateral Agent may need to evaluate the impact of potential liabilities before determining to foreclose on Collateral consisting of real property because secured creditors that hold a security interest in real property may be held liable under environmental laws for the costs of remediating or preventing the release or threatened release of hazardous substances at such real property. Consequently, the Collateral Agent may decline to foreclose on such Collateral or exercise remedies available in respect thereof if it does not receive indemnification to its satisfaction from the holders of the Notes. In addition, all or a portion of the Collateral may be released: - to enable the sale, transfer or other disposal of such Collateral in a transaction not prohibited under the Indenture, the Secured Notes Indenture or the Existing Credit Agreement governing our Existing Credit Facilities, including the sale of assets in accordance with the asset sale covenant and the sale of any entity in its entirety that owns or holds such Collateral; and - with respect to Collateral held by a Guarantor, upon the release of such Guarantor from its guarantee. In addition, the guarantee of a Guarantor will be released in connection with a transfer of such Guarantor in a transaction not prohibited by the Indenture or upon certain other events. See “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants—Asset Sales” and “Description of Notes—Security—Release of Liens.” The Indenture will permit us to designate one or more of our restricted subsidiaries as an unrestricted subsidiary. If we designate a Guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary, all of the liens on any Collateral owned by such subsidiary or any of its subsidiaries and any guarantees of the Notes by such subsidiary or any of its subsidiaries will be released under the Indenture. Designation of a subsidiary as unrestricted will reduce the aggregate value of the Collateral to the extent that liens on the assets of the unrestricted subsidiary and its subsidiaries are released. In addition, the creditors of the unrestricted subsidiary and its subsidiaries will have a senior claim on the assets of such unrestricted subsidiary and its subsidiaries. _The Collateral may not be valuable enough to satisfy all of the obligations secured by such Collateral._ The Notes, our Existing Secured Notes and our Existing Credit Facilities are secured on a first-priority lien basis (subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens) by substantially all of the assets of the Company and any existing and future Guarantors, including all of the capital stock of the Company and each restricted subsidiary, but excluding all of the assets of our non-guarantor subsidiaries. The actual value of the Collateral at any time will depend upon market and other economic conditions. In addition, the asset sale covenant and the definition of asset sale in the Indenture will have a number of significant exceptions pursuant to which we will be able to sell Collateral securing the Notes without being required to reinvest the proceeds of such sale into assets that will comprise Collateral or to make an offer to the holders of the Notes to repurchase the Notes. The value of the Collateral in the event of a liquidation will depend upon market and economic conditions, the availability of buyers and similar factors. No independent appraisals of any of the Collateral have been prepared by or on behalf of us in connection with the offering of the Notes. Accordingly, we cannot assure holders of the Notes that the proceeds of any sale of the Collateral following an acceleration to maturity with respect to the Notes would be sufficient to satisfy, or would not be substantially less than, amounts due on the Notes and the other debt secured thereby. If the proceeds of any sale of the Collateral were not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes, the holders of the Notes (to the extent their Notes were not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the pledged assets) would have only an unsecured claim against our remaining assets. By their nature, some or all of the Collateral may 29 ----- be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Likewise, we cannot assure holders of the Notes that the Collateral will be saleable or, if saleable, that there will not be substantial delays in their liquidation. To the extent that liens, rights and easements granted to third parties encumber assets located on property owned by us or constitute subordinate liens on the pledged assets, those third parties may have or may exercise rights and remedies with respect to the property subject to such encumbrances (including rights to require marshalling of assets) that could adversely affect the value of the Collateral located at that site and the ability of the Collateral Agent to realize or foreclose on the Collateral at that site. Moreover, the Indenture will permit us to issue additional secured debt, including debt secured equally and ratably by the same assets pledged for the benefit of the holders of the Notes, subject to certain limitations. This could reduce amounts payable to holders of the Notes from the proceeds of any sale of the Collateral. _The Collateral will be subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections that may exist in respect of the security interests required with respect to the Existing Credit Agreement._ The Collateral will be subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections that may exist in respect of the security interests required with respect to the Existing Credit Agreement. In addition, there will be no requirement to make any foreign security filings outside of the United States in respect of the Collateral. The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections or lack of filings could adversely affect the value of the Collateral as well as the ability of the Collateral Agent to realize or foreclose on the Collateral for the benefit of the holders of the Notes. The initial purchasers have neither analyzed the effect of, nor participated in any negotiations relating to, such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and imperfections, including the lack of any such filing in foreign jurisdictions outside of the United States, and the existence thereof could adversely affect the value of the Collateral as well as the ability of the Collateral Agent to realize or foreclose on the Collateral for the benefit of the holders of the Notes. _Rights of the holders of the Notes in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect liens on certain Collateral acquired in the future._ Applicable law requires that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest, such as real property, equipment subject to a certificate and certain proceeds, can only be perfected at the time such property and rights are acquired and identified. Furthermore, in certain jurisdictions, “blanket” or “floating” liens will not be available to secure any Collateral. Neither the Collateral Agent nor the Trustee will monitor, and we may not inform the Collateral Agent or the Trustee of, the future acquisitions of property and rights that constitute Collateral, and necessary action may not be taken to properly perfect the security interest in such after-acquired Collateral. Neither the Collateral Agent nor the Trustee has any obligation to monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights that constitute Collateral or the perfection of any security interest in favor of the Notes against third parties. As a result, the inability or failure of the Issuer or any Guarantor to promptly take all actions necessary to create properly perfected security interests in the Collateral may result in the loss of the priority, or a defect in the perfection, of the security interest for the benefit of the holders of the Notes to which they would have been otherwise entitled. In addition, as described further herein, even if the liens on Collateral acquired in the future are properly perfected, such liens may potentially be avoidable as a preference in any bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding under certain circumstances. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to this Offering and the Notes—Federal and state statutes allow courts, under specific circumstances, to avoid the Notes and the guarantees, to require holders of the Notes to return payments received from us or the Guarantors, and to take other actions detrimental to the holders of the Notes.” _The Collateral is subject to casualty risks._ Although we maintain insurance policies to insure against losses, there are certain losses that may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable, in whole or in part. As a result, it is possible that the insurance proceeds will not compensate us fully for our losses in the event of a catastrophic loss. If there is a total or partial loss of any of the Collateral, we cannot assure you that any insurance proceeds received by us will be sufficient to satisfy all the secured obligations, including the Notes. 30 ----- _We will, in most cases, have control over the Collateral, and the sale of particular assets by us could reduce the pool of assets securing the Notes and any future guarantees. In addition, certain assets, including Excluded Assets, will be excluded from the Collateral, and certain other liens will be permitted to exist on our assets, including the Collateral._ The terms of the Security Documents, the Existing Credit Agreement, the Secured Notes Indenture allow, and the Indenture will allow, us to remain in possession of, retain exclusive control over, freely operate, and collect, invest and dispose of any income from, the Collateral. For example, in accordance with the Security Documents, the Existing Credit Agreement, the Secured Notes Indenture and the Indenture, we may, among other things, without approval or consent of the Collateral Agent or the Trustee, conduct activities with respect to Collateral, such as selling, factoring, abandoning or otherwise disposing of Collateral and making cash payments (including repayments of indebtedness). The lien on any Collateral will be automatically released upon any permitted disposition thereof to a person that is not an Issuer or a Guarantor and, in such event, will no longer secure the obligations under the Indenture. See “Description of Notes—Security—Release of Liens.” In addition, certain assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors, including Excluded Assets, will be excluded from the Collateral, and other liens will be permitted to exist on our assets, including the Collateral, in each case as provided in the Indenture and the Security Documents. See “Description of Notes—Security.” _To the extent lien searches are performed, such searches may not reveal all existing liens on the Collateral._ We cannot guarantee that any lien searches conducted on the Collateral will reveal all existing liens on the Collateral. Any existing undiscovered lien could be significant, could be prior in ranking to the liens securing the Notes or the guarantees and could have an adverse effect on the ability of the Collateral Agent to realize or foreclose upon the Collateral. In addition, certain statutory priority liens may also exist that cannot be discovered by lien searches. _Rights of the holders of the Notes in the Collateral may be adversely affected by bankruptcy and insolvency proceedings and the holders of the Notes may not be entitled to post-petition interest, fees, or expenses in any bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding._ The right of the Collateral Agent to repossess and dispose of the Collateral is likely to be significantly impaired, and at a minimum delayed, if U.S. bankruptcy proceedings are commenced by or against us prior to or possibly even after the Collateral Agent has repossessed and disposed of the Collateral. Under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, pursuant to the automatic stay imposed upon a bankruptcy filing, secured creditors, such as the Collateral Agent, are prohibited from repossessing its security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from disposing of security repossessed from a debtor, without prior bankruptcy court approval (which may not be given under the circumstances). Moreover, U.S. bankruptcy law permits the debtor to continue to retain and to use collateral, and the proceeds, products, rents or profits of collateral, even though the debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments, provided that the secured creditor is given “adequate protection.” The meaning of the term “adequate protection” may vary according to circumstances, but it is intended in general to protect the value of the secured creditor’s interest in Collateral and may include cash payments or the granting of additional or replacement security, if and at such time as the court in its discretion determines, for any diminution in the value of Collateral as a result of the stay of repossession or disposition or any use of collateral by the debtor during the pendency of the bankruptcy case. A bankruptcy court may determine that a secured creditor does not require compensation for diminution in the value of its collateral if the value of such collateral exceeds the debt it secures. In view of the lack of a precise definition of the term “adequate protection” and the broad discretionary powers of a U.S. bankruptcy court, it is impossible to predict whether or when payments under the Notes could be delayed following the commencement of a bankruptcy case (or the length of the delay in making any such payments), whether or when the Collateral Agent would repossess or dispose of the Collateral, or whether or to what extent the holders of the Notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the Collateral through the requirements of “adequate protection.” Furthermore, in the event a U.S. bankruptcy court determines that the value of the Collateral is not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes, the Existing Secured Notes the Existing Credit Agreement and any additional obligations of the Company or any guarantor secured by the Collateral on a first-priority basis, the holders of the Notes would have “undersecured claims” as to the difference. Generally, U.S. bankruptcy laws do not permit the payment or accrual of post-petition interest, costs, expenses and attorneys’ fees for “undersecured claims” during the debtor’s bankruptcy case. Other consequences of a finding of under-collateralization would include, among other things, a lack of entitlement to receive “adequate protection” under U.S. bankruptcy laws with respect to any unsecured portion of 31 ----- the Notes. In addition, if any payments of post-petition interest had been made at the time of such a finding of undercollateralization, those payments could be recharacterized by a U.S. bankruptcy court as a reduction of the principal amount of the Notes. The rights of the Collateral Agent with respect to the Collateral may also be impaired, delayed or otherwise affected by the insolvency laws of the other jurisdictions in which we and the Guarantors are incorporated or organized. _In the event of a bankruptcy of us or any of the Guarantors, holders of the Notes may be deemed to have an unsecured claim to the extent that our obligations in respect of the Notes exceed the fair market value of the Collateral securing the Notes._ In any bankruptcy proceeding with respect to us or any of the Guarantors, it is possible that the bankruptcy trustee, the debtor-in-possession or competing creditors will assert that the fair market value of the Collateral with respect to the Notes on the date of the bankruptcy filing was less than the then-current principal amount of the Notes. Upon a finding by the bankruptcy court that the Notes are under-collateralized, the claims in the bankruptcy proceeding with respect to the Notes would be bifurcated between a secured claim and an unsecured claim, and the unsecured claim would not be entitled to the benefits of security in the Collateral. Other consequences of a finding of undercollateralization would be, among other things, a lock of entitlement on the part of the Notes to receive post-petition interest and a lock of entitlement on the part of the unsecured portion of the Notes to receive other “adequate protection” under federal bankruptcy laws. In addition, if any payments of post-petition interest had been made at the time of such a finding of under-collateralization, those payments could be recharacterized by the bankruptcy court as a reduction of the principal amount of the secured claim with respect to the Notes. 32 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,148

The Existing Credit Agreement provided for (a) the incurrence by the Company of (1) a senior secured term A facility in an aggregate principal amount of (i) $1,000.0 million denominated in U.S. dollars and (ii) €2,035.0 million denominated in euros and (2) a senior secured term B facility in an aggregate principal amount of (i) $1,400.0 million denominated in U.S. dollars and (ii) €850.0 million denominated in euros; and (b) the incurrence by the Company and Coty B.V., a Dutch subsidiary of the Company (the “Dutch Borrower”), of a senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $3,250.0 million denominated in U.S. dollars, specified alternative currencies or other currencies freely convertible into U.S. dollars and readily available in the London interbank market. Initial borrowings under the senior secured term B facility were issued at a 0.250% discount. The Existing Credit Agreement was modified by each of the 2019 Amendment, the 2020 Amendment and the 2021 Amendment described below. The Existing Credit Agreement provides that with respect to the then existing revolving credit facility, up to $150.0 million is available for letters of credit and up to $150.0 million is available for swing line loans. The Existing Credit Agreement also permits, subject to certain terms and conditions, the incurrence of incremental facilities thereunder in an aggregate amount of (i) $1,700.0 million plus (ii) an unlimited amount if the First Lien Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement), at the time of incurrence of such incremental facilities and after giving effect thereto on a pro forma basis, is less than or equal to 3.00 to 1.00. The obligations of the Company under the Existing Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the Guarantors and the obligations of the Company and the Guarantors under the Existing Credit Agreement are secured by a perfected firstpriority lien on substantially all of the assets of the Company and the Guarantors, subject to certain exceptions. The Dutch Borrower does not guarantee the obligations of the Company under the Existing Credit Agreement or grant any liens on its assets to secure any obligations under the Existing Credit Agreement. On June 27, 2019, the Company entered into an amendment (the “2019 Amendment”) to the Existing Credit Agreement. The 2019 Amendment modified the Existing Credit Agreement by (x) amending the financial covenant to (i) delay until the test period ending March 31, 2022 the “Total Net Leverage Ratio” step down from 5.25 to 5.00, (ii) extend the applicable window for certain cost savings add-backs in the calculation of “Adjusted EBITDA” for purposes of determining the “Total Net Leverage Ratio,” and (iii) amend the determination of the exchange rate to be used in the calculation of “Total Indebtedness” for purposes of determining the “Total Net Leverage Ratio,” and (y) decreasing the total commitments under the then existing revolving credit facility by $500.0 million to $2,750.0 million. On April 29, 2020, the Company entered into an additional amendment (the “2020 Amendment”) to further modify the Existing Credit Agreement by, among other things, (i) providing a financial covenant “holiday” through the test period ended March 31, 2021, (ii) establishing a minimum liquidity covenant through March 31, 2021 of $350.0 million, which increased to $500.0 million as a result of the prepayment event related to the sale of the Wella Business, and (iii) placing limitations on our ability to make certain investments and restricted payments (including our ability to pay dividends in cash) and to incur additional secured indebtedness, in each case through March 31, 2021. The 2020 Amendment did not modify the applicable funding costs during the period through March 31, 2021. The limitations on the Company’s activities imposed by the 2020 Amendment and the financial covenant “holiday” are no longer applicable. On June 4, 2021, the Company entered into an additional amendment (the “2021 Amendment”) to further modify the Existing Credit Agreement by, among other things, creating the New Revolving Credit Facility as a new class of revolving commitments in an aggregate principal amount of $700.0 million, which commitments will mature in April 2025.

The Controlling Authorized Representative shall have the sole right to act or refrain from acting with respect to enforcement proceedings in respect of the Common Collateral. The Controlling Authorized Representative shall not follow any instructions with respect to such Common Collateral from any Authorized Representative of any NonControlling Secured Party or First-Priority Secured Party (other than the requisite Controlling Secured Parties under the applicable Secured Credit Documents), and no Authorized Representative of any Non-Controlling Secured Party or other First-Priority Secured Party (other than the requisite Controlling Secured Parties under the applicable Secured Credit Documents) will instruct the Controlling Authorized Representative to commence any judicial or non-judicial foreclosure proceedings with respect to, seek to have a trustee, receiver, liquidator or similar official appointed for or over, attempt any action to take possession of, exercise any right, remedy or power with respect to, or otherwise take any action to enforce its security interest in or realize upon, or take any other action available to it in respect of, the Common Collateral. Notwithstanding the equal priority of the Liens on the Common Collateral, the Controlling Authorized Representative, acting on the instructions of the requisite Controlling Secured Parties under the applicable Secured Credit Documents, may deal with the Common Collateral as if such Controlling Authorized Representative had a senior Lien on such Collateral. No Authorized Representative of any Non-Controlling Secured Party or any NonControlling Secured Party may contest, protest or object to any foreclosure proceeding or action brought by the Controlling Authorized Representative. The Collateral Agent and each other Authorized Representative will agree 45 ----- that it will not accept any Lien on any Common Collateral for the benefit of the holders of Notes or of any other series of First-Priority Obligations, as applicable (other than funds deposited for the discharge or defeasance of the Indenture or the agreement governing such other series of First-Priority Obligations, as applicable), other than pursuant to the Security Documents and the security documents governing any other series of First-Priority Obligations (collectively, the “First-Priority Collateral Documents”). Each of the First-Priority Secured Parties also will agree (and pursuant to the Indenture the Trustee will be instructed to agree) that it will not (and will waive any right to) contest or support any other person in contesting, in any proceeding (including any insolvency or liquidation proceeding), the perfection, priority, validity or enforceability of a Lien held by or on behalf of any of the First-Priority Secured Parties in all or any part of the Collateral, or the enforceability of the Intercreditor Agreement. The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, if any Common Collateral is transferred to a third party or otherwise disposed of in connection with any enforcement by the Controlling Authorized Representative thereunder and in accordance with the terms thereof and the applicable First-Priority Collateral Documents, the Liens in favor of each Authorized Representative for the benefit of each series of First-Priority Secured Parties upon such Common Collateral will be automatically released and discharged. If an Event of Default or any event of default with respect to any other First-Priority Obligations has occurred and is continuing and the Controlling Authorized Representative or any First-Priority Secured Party is taking action to enforce rights in respect of any Common Collateral, or any distribution is made in respect of any Common Collateral in any bankruptcy case of the Company or any Guarantor or any First-Priority Secured Party receives any payment pursuant to any intercreditor agreement (other than the Intercreditor Agreement) with respect to any Common Collateral, the proceeds of any sale, collection or other liquidation of any such Collateral by any First-Priority Secured Party or received by the Controlling Authorized Representative or any First-Priority Secured Party pursuant to any such intercreditor agreement with respect to such Common Collateral and proceeds of any such distribution (subject, in the case of any such distribution, to the paragraph immediately following) to which the First-Priority Obligations are entitled under any other intercreditor agreement shall be applied among the First-Priority Obligations as set forth under “—Control over Collateral and Enforcement of Liens” above. None of the First-Priority Secured Parties may institute any suit or assert in any suit, bankruptcy, insolvency or other proceeding any claim against the Controlling Authorized Representative or any other First-Priority Secured Party seeking damages from or other relief by way of specific performance, instructions or otherwise with respect to any Common Collateral. In addition, none of the First-Priority Secured Parties may seek to have any Common Collateral or any part thereof marshaled upon any foreclosure or other disposition of such Collateral. If any FirstPriority Secured Party obtains possession of any Common Collateral or realizes any proceeds or payment in respect thereof, at any time prior to the discharge of each series of First-Priority Obligations, then it must hold such Common Collateral, proceeds or payment in trust for the other First-Priority Secured Parties and promptly transfer such Common Collateral, proceeds or payment to the Controlling Authorized Representative to be distributed in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement.",N/A,as_expected,2021,148

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event or conditional upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control Triggering Event at the time the Change of Control Offer is made. In the event that holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes accept a Change of Control Offer and the Company (or any third party making such Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Company as described above) purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, the Company or such third party will have the right, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 60 days following the repurchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer described above, to redeem all of the Notes that remain outstanding following such repurchase at a redemption price equal to the Change of Control Payment, plus to the extent not included in the Change of Control Payment, accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes that remain outstanding to, but excluding, the date of repurchase. In determining whether the holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes accept a Change of Control Offer, Notes owned by an Affiliate of the Company shall be deemed to be outstanding for the purposes of such Change of Control Offer. The Credit Agreement provides that the occurrence of certain change of control events with respect to the Company will constitute a default thereunder. Other indebtedness that the Company or its Subsidiaries has incurred or may incur may contain prohibitions on the occurrence of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or require the repurchase of such indebtedness upon a Change of Control Triggering Event. Moreover, the exercise by the holders of their right to require the Company to repurchase their Notes could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Company. Finally, the Company’s ability to pay cash to the holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be limited by its then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control Triggering Event, the Indenture will contain no provisions that permit the holders of the Notes to require that the Company repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The definition of Change of Control includes a phrase relating to the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of “all or substantially all” of the properties or assets of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of Notes to require the Company to repurchase its Notes as a result of a sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of less than all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole to another Person or group may be uncertain. 53 ----- The Change of Control Triggering Event repurchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make it more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of the Company and thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control Triggering Event repurchase feature is a result of negotiations between the initial purchasers and the Company. As of the Issue Date, the Company has no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control, although it is possible that it could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Company could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect the Company’s capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on the Company’s ability to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness.” Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford holders of the Notes protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Company’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event with respect to such Notes may be waived or modified with the written consent of a majority in principal amount of the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2021,148

Holders may present Notes for exchange or for registration of transfer at the Corporate Trust Office or at the office of any transfer agent designated for that purpose. The registrar or designated transfer agent will exchange or transfer the Notes if it is satisfied with the documents of title and identity of the Person making the request; provided that such transfer complies with the restrictions specified in the section of this offering memorandum titled “Transfer Restrictions.” The Company will not charge a service charge for any exchange or registration of transfer of Notes. However, the Company and the registrar may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable for the registration of transfer or exchange. The Company has initially appointed the Trustee as registrar in respect of the Notes. At any time the Company may (i) designate additional transfer agents; (ii) rescind the designation of any transfer agent; or (iii) approve a change in the office of any transfer agent. However, the Company is required to maintain a transfer agent in each place of payment for the Notes at all times.

Until otherwise designated by the Company, the Company’s office or agency will be the office of the paying agent maintained for such purpose in London, United Kingdom. The Company will initially designate Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch as paying agent for the Notes. The Company may at any time appoint new paying agents, transfer agents and registrars. At any time, the Company may designate additional paying agents or rescind the designation of any paying agents. However, the Company is required to maintain a paying agent in each place of payment for the Notes at all times. In addition, as long as the Notes remain outstanding, the Company has also agreed that it will, to the extent permitted as a matter of law, ensure that there is a paying agent with respect to the Notes in a European Union Member State that is not obliged to withhold or deduct tax pursuant to the European Union Council Directive 2003/48/EC (as amended) on the taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments which was adopted by the ECOFIN Council on June 3, 2003, and amended by Council Decision on July 19, 2004, or any law implementing or complying with, or introduced to conform to, such Directive. Any money deposited with the Trustee or any paying agent for the payment of principal or premium, if any, and interest on the Notes that remains unclaimed for the earlier of (i) two years after the date the payments became due and (ii) such time as the money escheats to the state, may be repaid to the Company upon its request.

The principal amount of any non-interest bearing Indebtedness or other discount security constituting Indebtedness at any date shall be the principal amount thereof that would be shown on a consolidated balance sheet of the Company dated such date prepared in accordance with GAAP. Notwithstanding the above, if any Indebtedness is incurred as Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness originally incurred pursuant to this covenant, and such Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness would cause any applicable Dollardenominated or Adjusted EBITDA restriction described under this “Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness” to be exceeded if calculated on the date of such Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness, such Dollar-denominated or Adjusted EBITDA restriction, as applicable, shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness is permitted to be incurred pursuant to the definition of “Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness.” If Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock originally incurred in reliance upon a percentage of Adjusted EBITDA under this covenant is being refinanced and such refinancing would cause the maximum amount of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock thereunder to be exceeded at such time, then such refinancing will nevertheless be permitted thereunder and such additional Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock will be deemed to have been incurred under the applicable provision so long as the principal amount or liquidation preference of such refinancing Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock does not exceed the principal amount or liquidation preference of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock being refinanced, plus additional Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock incurred to pay accrued but unpaid interest or dividends, premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance costs, underwriting or initial purchaser discounts, fees, costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) in connection with such refinancing. The principal amount or liquidation preference of any Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, if incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such respective Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing. The Indenture will not treat (1) unsecured Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to Secured Indebtedness merely because it is unsecured or (2) Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to any other Indebtedness merely because it has 63 ----- a junior priority with respect to the same collateral or because it is secured by different collateral or issued or guaranteed by other obligors.",N/A,as_expected,2021,148

To the extent that the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Company may use any remaining Excess Proceeds (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) (the “Declined Amounts”) for any purpose, subject to the paragraph below and the other covenants contained in the Indenture. If the aggregate amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of Notes and the Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered in an Asset Sale Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Trustee shall select the Notes and the Company or the agent for such Pari Passu Indebtedness shall select such Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased (a) if the Notes or such Pari Passu Indebtedness are listed on any national securities exchange, in compliance with the requirements of the principal national securities exchange on which the Notes or such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, are listed, (b) on a pro rata basis based on the amount (determined as set forth above) of the Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered or (c) by lot or such similar method in accordance with the procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable; provided that no Notes of €100,000 or less shall be repurchased in part.

An Asset Sale Offer or Advance Offer may be made at the same time as consents are solicited with respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture, Notes and/or Note Guarantees (but the Asset Sale Offer or Advance Offer may not condition tenders on the delivery of such consents). Pending the final application of any Net Proceeds pursuant to this covenant, the holder of such Net Proceeds may apply such Net Proceeds temporarily to reduce Indebtedness outstanding under a revolving credit facility or otherwise use such Net Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture. The Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. 66 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,148

In any case in which the Holder is the common depositary of Euroclear and Clearstream or its nominee, any Position Representation or Verification Covenant required hereunder shall be provided by the beneficial owner of the Notes in lieu of the common depositary of Euroclear and Clearstream or its nominee. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to the acceleration of the Notes, the Company determines in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder providing such Noteholder Direction was, at any relevant time, in breach of its Position Representation and provides to the Trustee evidence that the Company has filed papers with a court of competent jurisdiction seeking a determination that such Directing Holder was, at such time, in breach of its Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect to such Event of Default shall be automatically stayed pending a final and non-appealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction on such matter. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Company provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that a Directing Holder failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant, the cure period with respect to any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction shall be automatically stayed pending satisfaction of such Verification Covenant.

With their acquisition of the Notes, each Holder and subsequent purchaser of the Notes consents to the delivery of its Position Representation by the Trustee to the Company in accordance with the terms of this section. Each Holder and subsequent purchaser of the Notes waives in the Indenture any and all claims, in law and/or in equity, against the Trustee and agrees in the Indenture not to commence any legal proceeding against the Trustee in respect of, and agrees in the Indenture that the Trustee will not be liable for any action that the Trustee takes in accordance with this section, or arising out of or in connection with following instructions or taking actions in accordance with a Noteholder Direction.

The Additional Interest will accrue on all outstanding Notes from and including the date on which such failure first 104 ----- occurs until such violation is cured or waived and shall be payable on each interest payment date to holders of record on the regular record date immediately preceding the interest payment date. On the 181st day after such failure (if such violation is not cured or waived prior to such 181st day), such failure will then constitute an Event of Default without any further notice or lapse of time and the Notes will be subject to acceleration as provided above. The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default (the “Initial Default”) occurs, then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default that resulted solely because of that Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “Provision of Financial Information” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or such notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture.

No such rescission shall affect any subsequent Default under the Indenture or impair any right consequent thereto. The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes issued and then outstanding under the Indenture may waive any existing Default or Event of Default under the Indenture, and its consequences, except a default in the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the Notes or a covenant or provision of the Indenture which cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the holder of each outstanding Note affected. Holders of the Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture. The Trustee is under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Indenture at the request, order or direction of any of the holders of the Notes, unless such holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity or security satisfactory to the Trustee. Subject to all provisions of the Indenture and applicable law, the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Trustee may withhold from holders of the Notes notice of any continuing Default or Event of Default if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest, except a Default or Event of Default relating to the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the Notes. The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding compliance with the Indenture.

The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that settlement system and may be changed at any time. Neither we, the Trustee, nor the initial purchasers take any responsibility for those operations or procedures, and we and the initial purchasers urge investors to contact the system or their participants directly to discuss these matters. Euroclear and Clearstream have established procedures to facilitate transfers of interests in global notes among participants in those settlement systems.

Neither we nor the Trustee will have any 111 ----- responsibility for the performance by Euroclear or Clearstream or their participants or indirect participants of their obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations. Euroclear has advised us that it was created in 1968 to hold securities for its participants and to clear and settle transactions between Euroclear participants through simultaneous electronic book-entry delivery against payment, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of certificates and any risk from lack of simultaneous transfers of securities and cash. Euroclear provides various other services, including securities lending and borrowing and interfaces with domestic markets in several countries.

The Euroclear Terms and Conditions govern transfers of securities and cash within Euroclear, withdrawals of securities and cash from Euroclear and receipts of payment with respect to securities in Euroclear. All securities in Euroclear are held on a fungible basis without attribution of specific certificates to specific securities clearance accounts.

U.S. Holders using the cash method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes will be required to include in income the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency payment on a Note when the payment of interest is received (including a payment attributable to accrued but unpaid interest upon the sale, exchange, redemption, repurchase or other taxable disposition of a Note). The U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency payment is determined by translating the foreign currency received at the spot rate for such foreign currency on the date the payment is received, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to U.S. dollars at that time. The U.S. dollar value will be the U.S. Holder’s tax basis in the foreign currency received. A U.S. Holder will not recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such payment. U.S. Holders using the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes will be required to include in income the U.S. dollar value of the amount of interest income that has accrued and is otherwise required to be taken into account with respect to a Note during an accrual period. The U.S. dollar value of the accrued income will be determined by translating the income at the average rate of exchange for the accrual period or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average rate for the partial period within the taxable year. A U.S. Holder may elect, however, to translate the accrued interest income using the spot rate on the last day of the accrual period or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, using the exchange rate on the last day of the taxable year. If the last day of an accrual period is within five business days of the date of receipt of the accrued interest, a U.S. Holder may translate the interest using the spot rate on the date of receipt. The above election will apply to all other debt obligations held by the U.S. Holder and may not be changed without the consent of the IRS. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors before making the above election. Upon receipt of an interest payment (including upon the sale, exchange, redemption or other taxable disposition of the Notes, the receipt of proceeds which include amounts attributable to accrued interest previously included in income), the holder will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of such payment (determined by translating the foreign currency received at the spot rate for such foreign currency on the date such payment is received) and the U.S. dollar value of the interest income previously included in income with respect to such payment.

Upon a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, a","U.S. Holder will recognize taxable gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the disposition and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Note, which will generally equal the cost of the Note. The amount realized will be equal to the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency on the date the payment is received or the Notes are disposed of (or deemed disposed of as a result of a material change in the terms of the Notes), less any portion allocable to any accrued and unpaid stated interest, which portion will be taxed as ordinary interest income. The amount of any payment in or adjustments measured by foreign currency will be equal to the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency on the date of the purchase or adjustment. If, however, a Note is traded on an established securities market, and the U.S. Holder uses the cash basis method of tax accounting, the U.S. dollar value of the amount realized will be determined by translating the foreign currency payment at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition. A U.S. Holder that uses the accrual basis method of tax accounting may elect the same treatment with respect to the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of Notes traded on an established securities market, provided that the election is applied consistently. Except with respect to the foreign currency rules discussed below, gain or loss realized on the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note will generally be capital gain or loss and will be longterm capital gain or loss if at the time of the disposition the Note has been held for more than one year. Long-term capital gains recognized by noncorporate taxpayers are subject to reduced tax rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. A portion of the gain or loss with respect to the principal amount of a Note may be treated as foreign currency exchange gain or loss. Foreign currency exchange gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss. For these purposes, the principal amount of the Notes is the purchase price for the Notes calculated in the foreign currency on the date of purchase, and the amount of exchange gain or loss recognized is equal to the difference between (i) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount determined on the date of the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of the Note and (ii) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount determined on the date the Note was purchased. The amount of foreign currency exchange gain or loss will be limited to the amount of overall gain or loss realized on the disposition of the Notes. The tax basis in foreign currency received on the sale, exchange, retirement, or other disposition of a Note will be equal to the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency, determined at the time of the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition. As discussed above, if the Notes are traded on an established securities market, a cash basis U.S. Holder (or, upon election, an accrual basis U.S. Holder) will determine the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency by translating the foreign currency received at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition. Accordingly, in such case, no foreign currency exchange gain or loss will result from currency fluctuations between the trade date and settlement date of a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition. Any gain or loss recognized on a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption, or other taxable disposition of foreign currency (including its exchange for U.S. dollars or its use to purchase debt securities) will be ordinary income or loss. Information reporting and backup withholding._** Information returns generally will be filed with the IRS in connection with payments on the Notes and the proceeds from a sale or other disposition of the Notes. A U.S. Holder will be subject to backup withholding on these payments if the U.S. Holder fails to provide its correct taxpayer identification number to the applicable withholding agent and comply with certain certification procedures or otherwise establish an exemption from backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. The amount of any backup withholding from a payment to a U.S. Holder will be allowed as a credit against the U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle the U.S. Holder to a refund, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.",N/A,as_expected,2021,148

Accordingly, the entity through which the Notes are held will affect the determination of whether such withholding is required. Similarly, interest payable on the Notes held by or through an entity that is a non-financial non-U.S. entity that does not qualify under certain exemptions generally will be subject to withholding at a rate of 30%, unless such entity either (x) certifies that such entity does not have any “substantial United States owners”, (y) provides certain information regarding the entity’s “substantial United States owners,” which we will in turn provide to the United States Department of the Treasury, or (z) otherwise qualifies for an exemption from withholding under FATCA. Current provisions of the Code and Treasury Regulations would also treat gross proceeds from the disposition of the Notes as subject to FATCA withholding. However, proposed Treasury Regulations, if finalized in their current form, would eliminate FATCA withholding on gross proceeds entirely. Taxpayers generally may rely on those proposed regulations until final Treasury Regulations are issued. If withholding under FATCA is required on any payment related to the Notes, investors not otherwise subject to withholding (or that otherwise would be entitled to a reduced rate of withholding) on such payment may be required to seek a refund or credit from the IRS to obtain the benefit of such exemption (or reduction).

Certain employee benefit plans, including governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), certain church plans (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA) and non-U.S. plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA), are not subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, but may be subject to state, local, federal, non-U.S. or other laws or regulations substantively similar to such provisions of ERISA or the Code (“Similar Laws”). Any fiduciary or other person making a decision to invest assets of a Plan or a plan subject to Similar Law in the Notes should review carefully with their legal advisers and determine, among other things, whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing such Plan or plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Laws relating to a fiduciary’s duties to such Plan or plan, including the prudence and diversification provisions of ERISA, and whether the acquisition, holding or disposition of the Notes (or any interest in a Note) could constitute or give rise to a non-exempt prohibited transaction under ERISA or the Code, (as discussed below) or a violation of any Similar Law. A violation of the prohibited transaction rules may result, among other possible effects, in imposition of an excise tax or other penalties or liabilities under ERISA and the Code. Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit Plans from engaging in specified transactions involving Plan assets with persons or entities who are “parties in interest” within the meaning of ERISA or “disqualified persons” within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless an exemption is available. The acquisition or holding of the Notes (or any interest in a Note) by or on behalf of a Plan could give rise to a prohibited transaction if the transaction is with a party in interest or disqualified person with respect to that Plan. For example, the acquisition or holding of the Notes (or any interest in a Note) by or on behalf of a Plan could be considered to constitute or give rise to a prohibited transaction if persons such as the Issuer, an initial purchaser, the trustee or any of their respective affiliates (collectively, the “Transaction Parties”) is or becomes a party in interest or disqualified person with respect to the Plan. In that regard, certain exemptions from the prohibited transaction rules could be applicable to the acquisition and holding of the Notes (or any interest in a Note) by a Plan, depending on the circumstances. Included among these prohibited transaction exemptions are: the statutory exemption under Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code, regarding transactions with certain non-fiduciary service providers to Plans; prohibited transaction class exemption (“PTCE”) 90-1, regarding investments by insurance company pooled separate accounts; PTCE 95-60, as amended by PTCE 2002-13, regarding investments by insurance company general accounts; PTCE 91-38, as amended by PTCE 2002-13, regarding investments by bank collective investment funds; PTCE 96-23, regarding transactions effected by in-house asset managers; and PTCE 84-14, as amended by PTCE 2002-13, regarding transactions effected by “qualified professional asset managers.” However, the scope of relief under these prohibited transaction exemptions might not cover all acts that could be considered prohibited transactions in connection with investment in the Notes by Plans. No assurance can be given that any of the above exemptions, or any other exemptions, would cover any or all prohibited transactions that might arise in connection with a Plan’s acquisition, holding and disposition of the Notes (or any interest in a Note). Accordingly, each purchaser or transferee of the Notes (or any interest in a Note) will be deemed to represent and warrant that either (i) it is not, and is not directly or indirectly acquiring the Notes (or any interest in a Note) for, on behalf of or with any assets of, a Plan or a plan subject to Similar Law or (ii) its acquisition, holding and disposition of the Notes (or any interest in a Note) will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a violation of Similar Law and none of the Transaction Parties are or will be a fiduciary with respect to the acquisition, holding or disposition of the Notes by any Plan or any plan subject to Similar Law. 118 ----- Each purchaser and holder of the Notes has the exclusive responsibility for ensuring that its purchase, holding and subsequent disposition of the Notes do not violate the fiduciary or prohibited transaction rules of ERISA or the Code or provisions of any applicable Similar Laws.

Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by Regulation S under the Securities Act. Resales of the Notes are restricted as described under “Transfer Restrictions.” In addition, until 40 days after the commencement of the offering, an offer or sale of Notes within the United States by a broker/dealer (whether or not it is participating in the offering) may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than pursuant to Rule 144A. We and the Guarantors have agreed to indemnify the initial purchasers against liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, or to contribute to payments that they may be required to make in that respect.

TISE is not a regulated market for the purposes of MiFID II. Certain of the initial purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by applicable law. They are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes, and any market-making may be discontinued with respect to any or all series at any time at their sole discretion. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the development or liquidity of any market for the Notes. If an active trading market for the Notes does not develop, the market price and liquidity of the Notes may be adversely affected. If the Notes are traded, they may trade at a discount from their initial offering price, depending on prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities, our operating performance and financial condition, general economic conditions and other factors. You should be aware that the laws and practices of certain countries require investors to pay stamp taxes and other charges in connection with purchases of securities. In connection with the issue of the Notes, the Stabilizing Manager or persons acting on its behalf may over-allot Notes or effect transactions with a view to supporting the market price of the Notes at a level that is higher than that which might otherwise prevail. However, we cannot assure you that the Stabilizing Manager or persons acting on its behalf will undertake stabilization action. Any stabilization action may begin on or after the date on which adequate public disclosure of the terms of the offer of Notes is made and, if begun, may be ended at any time, but it must end no later than the earlier of 30 days after the issue date of the Notes and 60 days after the date of the allotment of the Notes. In the ordinary course of their respective businesses, the initial purchasers and certain of their respective affiliates have in the past and may in the future engage in commercial or investment banking or other transactions of a financial nature with us, including the provision of certain advisory services and the making of loans to us and our affiliates, for which they have received (or will receive) customary compensation. In particular, affiliates of certain of the initial purchasers act as lenders under our Existing Credit Facilities, which are expected to be prepaid with the proceeds of the offering of the Notes described herein. As a result, certain of the initial purchasers or their affiliates may receive a portion of the net proceeds from this offering, and/or customary compensation for acting in such capacities.

In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the initial purchasers and their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of ours or our affiliates (including the Notes). Certain of the initial purchasers or their affiliates that have a lending relationship with us or our affiliates routinely hedge, and certain other of those initial purchases or their affiliates are likely to hedge, their credit exposure to us and/or our affiliates consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, such initial purchaser and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in securities (including potentially the Notes). Any such credit default swaps or short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes. The initial purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.",N/A,as_expected,2021,148
