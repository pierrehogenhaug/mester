**PRELIMINARY OFFERING MEMORANDUM** **CONFIDENTIAL**

# Coty Inc.


## €500,000,000        % SENIOR SECURED NOTES DUE 2026 

We are offering €500 million principal amount of     % Senior Secured Notes due 2026 (the “Notes”). The
Notes will bear interest at a rate of      % per year, payable on     and      of each year, beginning     , 2021.
The Notes will mature on     , 2026.

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering to repay a portion of the term loans outstanding under our
existing senior secured credit facilities (the “Existing Credit Facilities”) and repay any related premiums, fees and
expenses thereto. See “Use of Proceeds.”

At any time prior to       , 2023, we may redeem some or all of the Notes at a price equal to 100% of the
principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the
redemption date, plus a “make-whole” premium, as described in this offering memorandum. On or after        ,
2023, we may redeem some or all of the Notes at the applicable redemption prices set forth in this offering
memorandum, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. At any time on or prior
to       , 2023, we may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes using the net cash
proceeds from certain equity offerings at the applicable redemption price set forth in this offering memorandum, plus
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. See “Description of Notes—Optional
Redemption.” We may also redeem the Notes in whole but not in part, at any time, upon the occurrence of certain tax
events. See “Description of Notes—Redemption for Tax Reasons.”

If we experience a change of control triggering event with respect to the Notes as described in this offering
memorandum under the heading “Description of Notes—Repurchase of Notes Upon a Change of Control Triggering
Event,” we will be required to offer to repurchase any and all of the Notes from the holders.

The Notes will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior secured basis (the
“guarantees”) by our existing and future wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries (the “Guarantors”) that guarantee our
obligations under the Existing Credit Facilities and certain other material indebtedness. The Notes and the guarantees
will be our and the Guarantors’ senior obligations and will be secured, subject to permitted liens and certain other
exceptions, by first-priority liens on the same Collateral (as defined herein) that secures the obligations under the
Existing Credit Facilities and our 5.000% senior secured notes due 2026 (the “Existing Secured Notes”). See
“Description of Notes—Security.” The guarantees and liens on the Collateral will be subject to release under certain
circumstances. See “Description of Notes—Guarantees” and “Description of Notes—Security.”

The Notes and the guarantees will be equal in right of payment with our and the Guarantors’ respective existing
and future senior indebtedness and will be senior to all of our and the Guarantors’ existing and future indebtedness
that is, by its terms, expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or the guarantees, as the case may be. The
Notes and the guarantees will be effectively pari passu with our and the Guarantors’ respective existing and future
indebtedness that is secured by a first-priority lien on the Collateral (including the obligations under the Existing
Credit Facilities and the Existing Secured Notes) to the extent of the value of the Collateral, and effectively senior to
our and the Guarantors’ respective existing and future indebtedness that is unsecured, including our existing unsecured
senior notes (the “Existing Unsecured Notes” and, together with the Existing Secured Notes, the “Existing Notes”)
and the guarantees thereof, or that is secured by junior liens on the Collateral, to the extent of the value of the
Collateral. In addition, the Notes and the guarantees will be structurally subordinated to all liabilities of any of our


-----

subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes and will be effectively junior to any indebtedness of ours or the Guarantors
that is secured by assets that are not Collateral, to the extent of the value of such assets.

**See “Risk Factors” beginning on page 18 and in our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our**
**subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q (as such risk factors may be updated from time to time in our**
**public filings) for a discussion of certain risks that you should consider in connection with an investment in the**
**Notes.**

**Notes issue price:   % plus accrued interest, if any, from      , 2021**

**The Notes and related guarantees have not been registered, and we will not be required to register the**
**Notes and related guarantees, under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or the**
**securities laws of any other jurisdiction, and are being offered and sold only to qualified institutional buyers**
**(“QIBs”) in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act (“Rule 144A”) and outside the United States**
**to non-U.S. persons in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act (“Regulation S”) and, if investors**
**are residents of a member state of the European Economic Area (the “EEA”) or the United Kingdom (the**
**“UK”), not to retail investors. Prospective purchasers that are QIBs are hereby notified that the seller of the**
**Notes may be relying on the exemption from the registration requirements under the Securities Act provided**
**by Rule 144A. For a description of certain information about eligible offerees and restrictions on transfers of**
**the Notes, see “Notice to Investors,” “Plan of Distribution” and “Transfer Restrictions.”**

Application will be made to The International Stock Exchange Authority (the “Authority” or “TISEA”) for the
listing of and permission to deal in the Notes on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange (“TISE”). No
application has been made for the Notes to be listed on any other stock exchange. TISE is not a regulated market for
the purposes of Directive 2014/65/EU or Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, as amended (“MiFID II”). This
offering memorandum constitutes a “Listing Document” for the purposes of the Listing Rules maintained by the
Authority.

We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made to investors in book-entry form through the facilities of
Clearstream Banking, S.A. (“Clearstream, Luxembourg”) and Euroclear Bank SA/NV (“Euroclear”) on or

**NOTICE TO INVESTORS**

This document may only be used where it is legal to sell these securities.

This offering memorandum is highly confidential and has been prepared by us solely for use in connection with
the offering of the Notes. Its use for any other purpose is not authorized. This offering memorandum is personal to the
offeree to whom it has been delivered by the initial purchasers and does not constitute an offer to any other person or
to the public generally. Distribution of this offering memorandum to any person other than the offeree and any person
retained to advise such offeree is unauthorized and any disclosure of the contents of this offering memorandum without
our prior written consent is prohibited. By accepting delivery of this offering memorandum, you agree to the foregoing
and to make no photocopies of this offering memorandum or any documents referred to herein. If you do not purchase
any Notes or this offering is terminated for any reason, you must return this offering memorandum and all documents
referred to herein to the initial purchasers, at: BNP Paribas, 10 Harewood Avenue, London NW1 6AA, England,
Attention: Fixed Income Syndicate.

Upon receiving this offering memorandum, you acknowledge that (1) you have been afforded an opportunity to
request from us, and to review, all additional information considered by you to be necessary to verify the accuracy of,
or to supplement, the information contained herein, (2) you have not relied on the initial purchasers or any person
affiliated with any initial purchaser in connection with any investigation of the accuracy of such information or your
investment decision and (3) we have not authorized any person to deliver any information different from that contained
in this offering memorandum. The offering is being made on the basis of this offering memorandum. Any decision to
purchase the Notes in the offering must be based on the information contained in this document. In making an
investment decision, investors must rely on their own examination of Coty and the terms of this offering, including
the merits and risks involved.

We have prepared this offering memorandum and we are solely responsible for its contents. The information
contained in and incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum has been furnished by us and other sources
we believe to be reliable. The initial purchasers make no representations or warranty, express or implied, as to the
accuracy or completeness of any of the information set forth in or incorporated by reference in this offering
memorandum, and you should not rely on anything contained in this offering memorandum as a promise or
representation by the initial purchasers, whether as to the past or the future. This offering memorandum contains
summaries, believed to be accurate, of the terms we consider material of certain documents, but reference is made to
the actual documents. All such summaries are qualified in their entirety by this reference. See “Where You Can Find
More Information; Incorporation by Reference.”

We reserve the right to withdraw the offering of the Notes at any time and we and the initial purchasers reserve
the right to reject any commitment to subscribe for the Notes in whole or in part and to allot to you less than the full
amount of Notes subscribed for by you.

The initial purchasers are not acting for the investors or any potential investors in connection with the transaction
referred to in this offering memorandum and will not be responsible to anyone for providing the protections offered
to clients of the initial purchasers nor for providing advice in relation to the transaction, this document or any
arrangement or other matter referred to herein.

Neither the initial purchasers nor any of their respective affiliates have authorized the whole or any part of this
offering memorandum and none of them makes any representation or warranty or accepts any responsibility as to the
accuracy or completeness of the information contained in this offering memorandum or any responsibility for any act
or omission of the Issuer, the Guarantors or any other person (other than the relevant initial purchaser) in connection
with the issue and offering of the Notes. Neither the delivery of this offering memorandum nor the offering, sale or
delivery of any Note shall in any circumstances create any implication that there has been no adverse change, or any
event reasonably likely to involve any adverse change, in the condition (financial or otherwise) of the Issuer since the
date of this offering memorandum.

This offering memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy the Notes to any
person in any jurisdiction where it is unlawful to make such offer or solicitation. You are not to construe the contents
of this offering memorandum as investment, legal or tax advice. You should consult your own counsel, accountant
and other advisors as to legal, tax, business, financial and related aspects of a purchase of the Notes. We are not, and

ii


-----

the initial purchasers are not, making any representation to you regarding the legality of an investment in the Notes
by you under applicable legal investment or similar laws.

**None of the Notes or the related guarantees have been registered with, recommended by or approved by**
**the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) or any other federal or state securities commission**
**or regulatory authority, nor has the SEC or any state securities commission or regulatory authority passed**
**upon the accuracy or adequacy of this offering memorandum. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal**
**offense.**

The offering is being made in reliance upon an exemption from registration under the Securities Act for an offer
and sale of securities that does not involve a public offering. In making your purchase, you will be deemed to have
made certain acknowledgments, representations and agreements set forth in this offering memorandum under the
caption “Transfer Restrictions.” The Notes are subject to restrictions on transferability and resale and may not be
transferred or resold except as permitted under the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws pursuant to
registration or an exemption from registration. You should be aware that you may be required to bear the financial
risks of this investment for an indefinite period of time.

You must comply with all laws and regulations that apply to you in any place in which you buy, offer or sell any
Notes or possess this offering memorandum. You must also obtain any consents, permission or approvals that you
need in order to purchase any Notes. We and the initial purchasers are not responsible for your compliance with these
legal requirements. We are not making any representation to you regarding the legality of your investment in the Notes
under any legal investment or similar law or regulation.

The distribution of this offering memorandum and the offer and the sale of the Notes may be restricted by law in
certain jurisdictions. Persons into whose possession this offering memorandum or any of the Notes come must inform
themselves about, and observe, any such restrictions. See “Plan of Distribution.”

We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefor on or about the settlement date
specified on the cover page of this offering memorandum, which will be the      business day following the date of
pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle being referred to as “T+    ”). Under SEC Rule 15c6-1 under the U.S.
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), trades in the secondary market generally are
required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly,
purchasers who wish to trade their Notes more than two business days prior to the scheduled settlement date will be
required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes initially will settle in T+    , to specify an alternate settlement cycle at
the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement and should consult their own advisors. See “Plan of
Distribution.”

**PROHIBITION OF SALES TO EEA RETAIL INVESTORS—The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold**
or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in
the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in
point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that
customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a
qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129. Consequently, no key information document
required by Regulation (EU) No. 1286/2014, as amended, (the “EU PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the
Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or
selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the EU
PRIIPs Regulation.

**PROHIBITION OF SALES TO UK RETAIL INVESTORS—The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold**
or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in
the UK. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in
point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European
Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“EUWA”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the Financial
Services and Markets Act 2000, as amended (“FSMA”) and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to
implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point
(8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (iii)
not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue

iii

of the EUWA. Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 as it forms
part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or
otherwise making them available to retail investors in the UK has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the
Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs
Regulation.

**EU MIFID II product governance/Professional investors and ECPs only target market – Solely for the**
purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the Notes has
led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible counterparties and professional clients only,
each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and
professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a
“distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor
subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either
adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**UK MiFIR product governance/Professional Investors and ECPs only target market –Solely for the**
purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the Notes has
led to the conclusion that (i) the target market for the Notes is only eligible counterparties, as defined in the FCA
Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook, and professional clients as defined in Regulation (EU) No. 600/2014 as
it forms part of domestic law of the UK by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“UK MiFIR”); and
(ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any
person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the
manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to the FCA Handbook Product Intervention
and Product Governance Sourcebook (the “UK MiFIR Product Governance Rules”) is responsible for undertaking its
own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers target market
assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**Stabilization**

IN CONNECTION WITH THE ISSUANCE OF THE NOTES, BNP PARIBAS (THE “STABILIZING
MANAGER”) (OR ANY PERSON ACTING ON BEHALF OF THE STABILIZING MANAGER) MAY OVERALLOT NOTES OR EFFECT TRANSACTIONS WITH A VIEW TO SUPPORTING THE MARKET PRICE OF
THE NOTES AT A LEVEL HIGHER THAN THAT WHICH MIGHT OTHERWISE PREVAIL. HOWEVER,
STABILIZATION MAY NOT NECESSARILY OCCUR. ANY STABILIZATION ACTION MAY BEGIN ON OR
AFTER THE DATE ON WHICH ADEQUATE PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF THE TERMS OF THE OFFER OF
THE NOTES IS MADE AND, IF BEGUN, MAY CEASE AT ANY TIME, BUT IT MUST END NO LATER THAN
THE EARLIER OF 30 DAYS AFTER THE ISSUE DATE OF THE NOTES AND 60 DAYS AFTER THE DATE
OF THE ALLOTMENT OF THE NOTES.

**Guarantors ....................................................................** Each of our wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries that

Facilities and certain other material indebtedness will
fully and unconditionally guarantee the Notes on a joint
and several basis.

Each of the guarantees will be a senior secured
obligation of each Guarantor and will be:

                            - equal in right of payment with all existing and
future senior indebtedness of such Guarantor,
including its guarantees of the Existing Credit
Facilities and the Existing Notes;

                            - effectively _pari passu with all existing and_
future indebtedness of such Guarantor that is
secured by a first-priority lien on the Collateral,
including its obligations under its guarantees of
the Existing Credit Facilities and the Existing
Secured Notes, to the extent of the value of the
Collateral;

                            - senior in right of payment to any future
subordinated indebtedness of such Guarantor;

-----

                            - effectively senior to all existing and future
indebtedness of such Guarantor that is
unsecured, including its guarantees of, or that
is secured by junior liens on the Collateral, to

                            - effectively junior to any indebtedness of such
Guarantor that is secured by assets that are not
Collateral, to the extent of the value of such
assets.

The guarantees will be subject to release under certain
circumstances. See “Description of Notes—

**Security .........................................................................** The Notes and the guarantees will be secured on a first
lien basis by substantially all tangible and intangible
assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors, other than
Excluded Assets (as defined in “Description of Notes—
Security”) (collectively, the “Collateral”), subject to
permitted liens. See “Description of Notes—Security.”

No appraisal of the value of the Collateral has been
made in connection with this offering, and the value of
the Collateral in the event of liquidation may be
materially different from its book value. The fair market
value of the Collateral is subject to fluctuations based on
factors that include, among others, the condition of our
industry, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly
sale, general economic conditions and the availability of
buyers. The amount to be received upon a sale of the
Collateral would also be dependent on numerous
factors, including, but not limited to, the actual fair
market value of the Collateral at such time and the
timing and the manner of the sale. By its nature, portions
of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily
ascertainable market value. Accordingly, there can be
no assurance that the Collateral can be sold in a short
period of time or in an orderly manner. In addition, in
the event of a bankruptcy, your ability to realize upon
any of the Collateral may be subject to certain
bankruptcy law limitations. The liens on all or a portion
of the Collateral may also be released in certain
circumstances. As a result, in the event of a liquidation
of the Collateral, the proceeds may not be sufficient to
satisfy the obligations under the Notes, the Existing
Secured Notes and the Existing Credit Facilities. See
“Description of Notes—Security—General.”

will become a party to the intercreditor agreement (the
“Intercreditor Agreement”) with the collateral agent

Existing Secured Notes. The Intercreditor Agreement

to the Collateral of the Credit Agreement Agent on
behalf of itself, the administrative agent and the lenders
under the Existing Credit Facilities, the collateral agent
for and the holders of the Existing Secured Notes, the
Collateral Agent and the holders of the Notes and the
holders of any other first-priority obligations. See
“Description of Notes—Security—Intercreditor
Agreement.”
**Priority ..........................................................................** The Notes will be secured senior obligations of the
Issuer and will be:

                            - equal in right of payment with all existing and
future senior indebtedness of the Issuer,
including its obligations under the Existing
Credit Facilities and the Existing Notes;

                            - effectively _pari passu with all existing and_
future indebtedness of the Issuer that is secured
by a first-priority lien on the Collateral,
including its obligations under the Existing
Credit Facilities and the Existing Secured
Notes, to the extent of the value of the
Collateral;

                            - senior in right of payment to any future
subordinated indebtedness of the Issuer;

                            - effectively senior to all existing and future
indebtedness of the Issuer that is unsecured,
including the Issuer’s obligations under the
existing Unsecured Notes, or that is secured by
junior liens on the Collateral, to the extent of
the value of the Collateral;

                            - structurally subordinated to all liabilities of any
of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the
Notes; and

                            - effectively junior to any indebtedness of the
Issuer that is secured by assets that are not

assets.

As of March 31, 2021, after giving effect to the offering
of the Notes offered hereby, the issuance and sale of the
Existing Secured Notes, in each case the use of proceeds
therefrom, and the creation of the New Revolving Credit
Facility, our total consolidated indebtedness would have
been approximately $5.4 billion (none of which would
have been subordinated), of which approximately $3.9
billion would have been secured indebtedness. We
would also have had $2.1 billion of secured borrowings
available under our revolving credit facilities.

required to offer to repurchase all or part of the Notes at
101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to but excluding the date of redemption.
See “Description of Notes—Repurchase of Notes Upon
a Change of Control Triggering Event.”

**Asset Sales .....................................................................** If the Issuer or its restricted subsidiaries engage in
certain asset sales, the Issuer or its restricted subsidiaries
generally must either invest the net proceeds from such
asset sales in its business within a specific period of
time, prepay certain of its or Guarantors’ debt or make
an offer to purchase a principal amount of the Notes with
the specified excess net proceeds, subject to certain
exceptions. The purchase price of the Notes in any such
offer will be 100% of their principal amount plus
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the
repurchase date. See “Description of Notes —Certain
Covenants—Asset Sales.”

**Certain Covenants ........................................................** The Notes will be issued under an indenture (the
“Indenture”) that contains covenants that, among other
things, limit the Issuer’s ability, and the ability of its
restricted subsidiaries, to:

                            - incur additional indebtedness, guarantee
indebtedness or issue disqualified stock or, in
the case of such subsidiaries, preferred stock;

                            - pay dividends on, repurchase or make
distributions in respect of their capital stock or
make other restricted payments;

                            - make certain investments or acquisitions;

                            - sell, transfer or otherwise convey certain
assets;

                            - create liens and enter into sale and leaseback
transactions;

                            - enter into agreements restricting certain
subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends or make
other intercompany transfers;

                            - consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of
all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer
and its restricted subsidiaries;

                            - enter into certain transactions with affiliates;
and

                            - prepay certain kinds of indebtedness.

The covenants will be subject to a number of exceptions
and qualifications. For more details, see “Description of
Notes—Certain Covenants.” In addition, most of these
covenants will be suspended if the Notes have
investment grade ratings from at least two of Moody’s,
S&P and Fitch and no default has occurred and is
continuing.

**No Prior Market / No Listing ......................................** The Notes are a new issue of securities for which there
currently is no market. In addition, the Notes are subject
to certain restrictions on resale and transfer as described
under “Transfer Restrictions.” We intend to apply for
the listing of a permission to deal in the Notes on the
Official List of TISE. However, we cannot guarantee
that the application to list the Notes on the Official List
of TISE will be approved as of the issue date or any date
thereafter, that the permission to deal in the Notes will
be granted or that the listing of the Notes will be
maintained, and settlement of the Notes is not
conditioned on obtaining this listing. TISE is not a
regulated market for the purposes of MiFID II. This
offering memorandum and the document constituting
the Notes together form a “Listing Document” for the
purposes of the Listing Rules maintained by the
Authority. Certain of the initial purchasers have advised
us that they intend to make a market in the Notes as
permitted by applicable law. They are not obligated,
however, to make a market in the Notes and any marketmaking may be discontinued at any time at their sole
discretion. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to
the development or liquidity of any market for the
Notes.

defined in Regulation S) except in a transaction exempt
from, or not subject to, the registration requirements of
the Securities Act. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

repay a portion of the term loans outstanding under the
Existing Credit Facilities and to pay any related
premiums, fees and expenses. See “Use of Proceeds.”
Certain of the initial purchasers or their respective
affiliates may hold a portion of the term loans and
therefore may receive a portion of the proceeds of this
offering. See “Plan of Distribution” for more

**SUMMARY HISTORICAL CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

The following tables set forth our summary historical consolidated financial information as of the dates and for
the periods indicated. The summary historical consolidated financial information as of June 30, 2020 and 2019 and
for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018 has been derived from our audited consolidated financial
statements incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum. The summary historical consolidated financial
information as of June 30, 2018 has been derived from our audited consolidated financial statements not included or
incorporated by reference herein. The summary historical consolidated financial information as of March 31, 2021
and for the nine months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 has been derived from our unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum. The unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements have been prepared on a basis consistent with the basis on which our audited consolidated
financial statements have been prepared and, in the opinion of our management, reflect all adjustments, of a normal
recurring nature, considered necessary for a fair presentation of such data. Our results for the nine months ended
March 31, 2021 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year or for any other periods.

The summary financial information for the twelve months ended March 31, 2021 was derived by subtracting the
unaudited condensed consolidated financial information of the Company for the nine months ended March 31, 2020
from the audited consolidated financial information of the Company for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, and
adding the difference to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial information of the Company for the nine
months ended March 31, 2021. The unaudited financial information for the twelve months ended March 31, 2021 has
been prepared solely for the purposes of this offering memorandum, is for illustrative purposes only and is not
necessarily indicative of the Company’s results of operations for any future period or the Company’s financial
condition at any future date.

The summary historical consolidated financial information set forth below should be read in conjunction with the
historical consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto referred to above. For more information, see the

**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**

To supplement the financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, we use non-GAAP financial measures
including free cash flow, adjusted operating income, adjusted EBITDA and covenant adjusted EBITDA. See the
applicable discussion below for the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly
comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial
measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures reported
in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect
all the items associated with the operations of the business as determined in accordance with GAAP. Other companies,
including companies in the beauty industry, may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures differently
than we do, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.

Despite the limitations of these non-GAAP financial measures, our management uses them as key metrics in the
evaluation of our performance and annual budgets and to benchmark performance of our business against our
competitors. The following are examples of how these non-GAAP financial measures are utilized by our management:
(i) for strategic plans and preparing annual budgets, (ii) senior management receives a monthly analysis comparing
budget to actual operating results that is prepared using the non-GAAP financial measures and (iii) senior
management’s annual compensation is calculated, in part, by using some of the non-GAAP financial measures. We
believe that the non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in their assessment of our operating performance
and the valuation of the Company. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures address questions we routinely
receive from analysts and investors and, in order to ensure that all investors have access to the same data, we have
determined that it is appropriate to make this data available to all investors. The non-GAAP financial measures exclude
the impact of certain items (as further described below) and provide supplemental information regarding our operating
performance. By disclosing these non-GAAP financial measures, we intend to provide investors with a supplemental
comparison of our operating results and trends for the periods presented. We believe these measures are also useful to
investors as such measures allow investors to evaluate our performance using the same metrics that our management
uses to evaluate past performance and prospects for future performance. We provide disclosure of the effects of these
non-GAAP financial measures by presenting the corresponding measure prepared in conformity with GAAP in our
financial statements, and by providing a reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP measures so that investors may
understand the adjustments made in arriving at the non-GAAP financial measures and use the information to perform
their own analyses.

Adjusted operating income from continuing operations excludes restructuring costs and business structure
realignment programs, amortization, acquisition- and divestiture-related costs and acquisition accounting impacts,
asset impairment charges and other adjustments as described below. We do not consider these items to be reflective
of our core operating performance due to the variability of such items from period-to-period in terms of size, nature
and significance. They are primarily incurred to realign our operating structure and integrate new acquisitions, and
exclude divestitures, and fluctuate based on specific facts and circumstances. Additionally, adjusted net income
attributable to Coty Inc. and adjusted net income attributable to Coty Inc. per common share are adjusted for certain
interest and other (income) expense as described below and the related tax effects of each of the items used to derive
adjusted net income as such charges are not used by our management in assessing our operating performance periodto-period.

Non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on the following items:

  - Costs related to acquisition and divestiture activities: We have excluded acquisition- and divestiture-related
costs and the accounting impacts such as those related to transaction costs and costs associated with the
revaluation of acquired inventory in connection with business combinations because these costs are unique
to each transaction. Additionally, for divestitures, we exclude write-offs of assets that are no longer
recoverable and contract related costs due to the divestiture. The nature and amount of such costs vary
significantly based on the size and timing of the acquisitions and divestitures, and the maturities of the
businesses being acquired or divested. Also, the size, complexity and/or volume of past transactions, which

12


-----

often drives the magnitude of such expenses, may not be indicative of size, complexity and/or volume of any
future acquisitions or divestitures.

- Restructuring and other business realignment costs: We have excluded costs associated with restructuring
and business structure realignment programs to allow for comparable financial results to historical operations
and forward-looking guidance. In addition, the nature and amount of such charges vary significantly based
on the size and timing of the programs. By excluding the referenced expenses from our non-GAAP financial
measures, we are able to further evaluate our ability to utilize existing assets and estimate their long-term
value. Furthermore, we believe that the adjustment of these items supplement the GAAP information with a
measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance

- Asset impairment charges: We have excluded the impact of asset impairments as such non-cash amounts are
inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and/or size of acquisitions.
Our management believes that the adjustment of these items supplement the GAAP information with a
measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance.

- Amortization Expense: We have excluded the impact of amortization of finite-lived intangible assets, as such
non-cash amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing
and/or size of acquisitions. We believe that the adjustment of these items supplement the GAAP information
with a measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance. Although we
exclude amortization of intangible assets from our non-GAAP expenses, we believe that it is important for
investors to understand that such intangible assets contribute to revenue generation. Amortization of
intangible assets that relate to past acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have
been fully amortized. Any future acquisitions may result in the amortization of additional intangible assets.

- Loss/(Gain) on divestitures and sale of brand assets: We have excluded the impact of Loss/(gain) on
divestitures and sale of brand assets as such amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are
significantly impacted by the size of divestitures. We believe that the adjustment of these items supplement
the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of our operating
performance.

- Interest (income) expense: We have excluded foreign currency impacts associated with acquisition-related
and debt financing-related forward contracts, as well as debt financing transaction costs as the nature and
amount of such charges are not consistent and are significantly impacted by the timing and size of such
transactions.

- Other expense (income): We have excluded the impact of costs incurred for legal and advisory services
rendered in connection with the tender offer that was in fiscal 2019 initiated by certain of our shareholders.
Additionally, we have excluded the write-off of deferred financing fees and discounts that resulted from the
pay down of our term debt from the proceeds of the sale of the Wella Business, due to the requirements of
the Existing Credit Agreement (as defined below). We believe these costs do not reflect our underlying
ongoing business, and the adjustment of such costs helps investors and others compare and analyze
performance from period to period. We have also excluded the impact of pension curtailment (gains) and
losses and pension settlement as such events are triggered by our restructuring and other business realignment
activities and the amount of such charges vary significantly based on the size and timing of the programs.
Further, we have excluded the change in fair value of the investment in Wella, as our management believes
these unrealized (gains) and losses do not reflect our underlying ongoing business, and the adjustment of
such impact helps investors and others compare and analyze performance from period to period.

- Loss on early extinguishment of debt: We have excluded loss on extinguishment of debt as this represents a
non-cash charge, and the amount and frequency of such charges is not consistent and is significantly impacted
by the timing and size of debt financing transactions.

- Noncontrolling interest: This adjustment represents the after-tax impact of the non-GAAP adjustments
included in Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests based on the relevant non-controlling interest
percentage.

13


-----

  - Tax: This adjustment represents the impact of the tax effect of the pretax items excluded from adjusted net
income. The tax impact of the non-GAAP adjustments is based on the tax rates related to the jurisdiction in
which the adjusted items are received or incurred. Additionally, adjustments are made for the tax impact of
any intra-entity transfer of assets and liabilities.

While acquiring brands and licenses comprises a part of our overall growth strategy, along with targeting organic
growth opportunities, we have excluded acquisition-related costs and acquisition accounting impacts in connection
with business combinations because these costs are unique to each transaction and the amount and frequency are not
consistent and are significantly impacted by the timing and size of our acquisitions. We assess the success of an
acquisition as a component of performance using a variety of indicators depending on the size and nature of the
acquisition, including:

  - The scale of the combined company be evaluating consolidated and segment financial metrics;

  - The expansion of product offerings by evaluating segment, brand and geographic performance and the
respective strength of the brands;

  - The evaluation of share expansion in categories and geographies;

  - The earnings per share accretion and substantial incremental free cash flow generation providing financial
flexibility for us; and

  - The comparison of actual and projected results, including achievement of projected synergies, post
integration; provided that timing for any such comparison will depend on the size and complexity of the
acquisition.

(1) Adjusted operating income is defined as operating income excluding restructuring and other business realignment costs, amortization

expense, acquisition- and divestiture-related costs, and asset impairment charges.  Adjusted EBITDA is defined as adjusted operating
income excluding depreciation and non-cash stock-based compensation. Covenant adjusted EBITDA is defined as adjusted EBITDA further
adjusted to include covenant synergy credit and other items permitted under our Existing Credit Facilities, the Secured Notes Indenture, the
Unsecured Notes Indenture and the Indenture. A reconciliation of Adjusted operating (loss) income, Adjusted EBITDA and covenant
adjusted EBITDA to operating income is presented in the tables below.

(2) As adjusted total debt is defined as total debt, after giving effect to this offering and the application of the proceeds therefrom described

under “Use of Proceeds.” As of March 31, 2021, as adjusted total debt would have been $5,421.9 and the ratio of as adjusted total debt to
covenant adjusted EBITDA would have been 4.7x.

(3) As adjusted net debt is defined as total debt, less cash and cash equivalents, after giving effect to this offering and the application of the

proceeds therefrom described under “Use of Proceeds.” As of March 31, 2021, as adjusted net debt would have been $5,106.6 and the ratio
of as adjusted net debt to covenant adjusted EBITDA would have been 4.4x.

(4) As adjusted secured debt is defined as total debt, that is secured by collateral, after giving effect to this offering and the application of the

proceeds therefrom described under “Use of Proceeds.” As of March 31, 2021, as adjusted secured debt would have been $3,934.8 and the
ratio of as adjusted secured debt to covenant adjusted EBITDA would have been 3.4x.

(5) As adjusted secured net debt is defined as total debt, that is secured by collateral, less cash and cash equivalents, after giving effect to this

offering and the application of the proceeds therefrom described under “Use of Proceeds.” As of March 31, 2021, as adjusted secured net
debt would have been $3,619.5 and the ratio of as adjusted secured net debt to covenant adjusted EBITDA would have been 3.1x.

(6) We are presenting covenant adjusted EBITDA to help investors evaluate our ability to comply with our covenants, as covenant adjusted

EBITDA has been a key component of the covenants in our Existing Credit Facilities and the Secured Notes Indenture, the Unsecured
Notes Indenture and will continue to be a key component of the Indenture that will govern the Notes offered hereby. While the Existing
Credit Facilities and the Secured Notes Indenture and the Unsecured Notes Indenture permit, and Indenture will permit covenant adjusted
EBITDA to be calculated inclusive of potential synergies and estimated EBITDA from acquired entities, the inclusion of such synergies and
EBITDA should not be viewed as a projection of future results, but is simply provided to permit investors to understand how covenant
adjusted EBITDA is calculated under these debt instruments.

(7) Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. We are presenting free cash flow to

**RISK FACTORS**

Investing in the Notes involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below (as
such risk factors may be updated from time to time in our public filings), as well as the other information included in
or incorporated by reference into this offering memorandum, before making a decision to invest in the Notes. The
risks described below and incorporated by reference are not the only risks that we face. Additional risks and
uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations.
Any of these risks may have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, results of
operations, profitability, cash flows or liquidity. In such a case, you may lose all or part of your investment in the
Notes.


**Risks Relating to the Company’s Business**

_Our operations and sales have been adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and we must successfully manage_
_the demand, supply, operational and financial challenges associated with the actual or perceived effects of COVID-_
_19 and the related widespread public health crisis._

The COVID-19 pandemic is having widespread, rapidly evolving, and unpredictable impacts on global society,
economies, financial markets and business practices. Our business has been, and may continue to be, negatively
impacted by the fear of exposure to or actual effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in countries where we operate or our
customers are located, such as reduced travel or recommendations or mandates from governmental authorities to avoid
large gatherings or to self-quarantine, as well as temporary closures of our facilities or the facilities of our customers
or suppliers. Easing of containment measures and recovery of the impacted sectors of the economy has been, and may
continue to be, gradual and uneven, as regions face resurgence of COVID-19 and related uncertainties, and the
availability and widespread distribution of a safe and effective vaccine varies across regions. The impacts include, but
are not limited to: significant reductions in demand or significant volatility in demand for one or more of our products,
which may be caused by, among other things, the temporary inability of consumers to purchase our products due to
illness, quarantine or other travel restrictions, store closures, or financial hardship, shifts in demand away from one or
more of our discretionary or higher priced products to lower priced products, or stockpiling or similar activity, supply
chain and shipping constraints, reduced options for marketing and promotion of products or other restrictions in
connection with COVID-19; if prolonged, such impacts can further increase the difficulty of operating our business,
including accurately planning and forecasting, and may adversely impact our results; the inability to meet our
customers’ needs and achieve costs targets due to disruptions in our manufacturing and supply arrangements caused
by the loss or disruption of essential manufacturing and supply elements such as raw materials or other finished
product components, transportation, workforce, or other manufacturing and distribution capability, or the allocation
of manufacturing capacity towards medical supplies such as hydro-alcoholic gel (which is used in hand sanitizer);
failure of third parties on which we rely, including our suppliers, our customers, contract manufacturers, distributors,
contractors, commercial banks, joint venture partners and external business partners, to meet their obligations to the
Company or to timely meet those obligations, or significant disruptions in their ability to do so, which may be caused
by their own financial or operational difficulties and may adversely impact our operations; or significant changes in
the political conditions in markets in which we manufacture, sell or distribute our products, including quarantines,
governmental or regulatory actions, closures or other restrictions that limit or close our operating and manufacturing
facilities, restrict our employees’ ability to travel or perform necessary business functions, restrict or prevent
consumers from having access to our products, or otherwise prevent our third-party partners, suppliers, or customers
from sufficiently staffing operations, including operations necessary for the production, distribution, sale and support
of our products, which could adversely impact our results.

These impacts have had and could continue to have a negative effect on our business, financial condition, results
of operations and cash flows, as well as the trading price of our securities, and the duration and extent to which our
future results of operations and overall financial performance will be impacted remains uncertain. In light of the
adverse impact on our near-term revenues, earnings, liquidity and cash flows, we have taken and expect to continue
to implement measures to reduce discretionary expenses and manage costs. These measures may not achieve results
in accordance with our expectations or on the timelines we anticipate. Despite our efforts to manage and remedy these
impacts to the Company, their ultimate impact also depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control, including
the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as third-party actions taken to contain its spread and
mitigate its public health effects.

**Risks Relating to this Offering and the Notes**

_We have taken on significant debt, which may adversely affect our business._

We have a substantial amount of indebtedness. As of March 31, 2021, after giving effect to the offering of the
Notes offered hereby, the issuance and sale of the Existing Secured Notes, in each case the use of proceeds therefrom,
and the creation of the New Revolving Credit Facility, our total consolidated indebtedness would have been
approximately $5.4 billion, all of which we will need to refinance or repay. We would also have had $0.7 billion of
secured borrowings drawn under our revolving credit facilities. There can be no assurances we will be able to refinance
our indebtedness in the future (1) on commercially reasonable terms, (2) on terms, including with respect to interest
rates, as favorable as our current debt or (3) at all.

Our debt burden could have important consequences, including increasing our vulnerability to general adverse
economic and industry conditions; limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and
our industry; requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of any cash flow from operations to the payment of
principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to fund our
operations, growth strategy, working capital, capital expenditures, future business opportunities and other general
corporate purposes; exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates with respect to any borrowings that are at variable
rates of interest; restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;
limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, research and development,
debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; limiting our ability to adjust to
changing market conditions; and placing us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors who are less
highly leveraged. In addition, a significant portion of our cash and investments are held outside the United States, and
we may not be able to service our debt without undergoing the costs of repatriating those funds.

_The instruments that govern, or will govern, our debt contain, or will contain, various covenants that impose_
_restrictions on us that may affect our ability to operate our business._

Instruments that govern, or will govern, our indebtedness, including the Existing Credit Agreement, the indenture
governing the Existing Unsecured Notes (the “Unsecured Notes Indenture”), the indenture governing the Existing
Secured Notes (the “Secured Notes Indenture”) and the Indenture, impose or will impose operating and financial
restrictions on our activities. These restrictions limit or prohibit our ability and the ability of us and our restricted
subsidiaries to, among other things:

  - incur indebtedness or grant liens on our property to secure indebtedness;

  - dispose of assets or equity;

  - make acquisitions or investments;

  - make dividends, distributions or other restricted payments;

  - effect affiliate transactions;

  - enter into sale and leaseback transactions; and

  - enter into mergers, consolidations or sales of substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries.

In addition, the Existing Credit Agreement includes a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a total net
leverage ratio (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement) equal to or less than certain levels set forth in the Existing
Credit Agreement.

These restrictions on our ability to operate our business could seriously harm our business by, among other things,
limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, merger and acquisition and other corporate opportunities.

Further, various risks, uncertainties and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with these
covenants. Failure to comply with any of the covenants in our financing agreements could result in an event of default
under those agreements and under any other agreements containing cross-default provisions. Such an event of default,
if not waived or cured, would permit lenders to accelerate the maturity of the debt under these agreements and to

19


-----

foreclose upon any collateral securing the debt (including the Collateral securing the Notes offered hereby, the Existing
Secured Notes and the Existing Credit Facilities). Under these circumstances, we might not have sufficient funds or
other resources to satisfy all of our obligations, including our obligations under the Existing Credit Agreement. the
Unsecured Notes Indenture, the Secured Notes Indenture and the Indenture. In addition, the limitations imposed by
financing agreements on our ability to incur additional debt and to take other actions might significantly impair our
ability to obtain other financing. We cannot assure you that we will be granted waivers or amendments to these
agreements if for any reason we are unable to comply with these agreements or that we will be able to refinance our
debt on terms acceptable to us, or at all.

_If we default on our obligations under our other indebtedness, we may not be able to make payments on the Notes._

Any default under the agreements governing our indebtedness, including a default under the Indenture, the
Existing Credit Agreement, the Unsecured Notes Indenture or the Secured Notes Indenture that is not waived by the
required percentage of noteholders or lenders, as applicable, could impede our ability to pay principal and premium
amounts, if any, and interest on the Notes and substantially decrease the market value of the Notes. If we are unable
to generate sufficient cash flow and are otherwise unable to obtain funds necessary to meet required payments of
principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, or if we otherwise fail to comply with the various
covenants, including financial and operating covenants, in the agreements governing our indebtedness, we could be
in default under the terms of the agreements governing such indebtedness. In the event of such a default, the holders
of such indebtedness in the applicable required percentage could elect to declare all the funds borrowed thereunder to
be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, lenders under our revolving credit facilities in the
applicable required percentage could elect to terminate their commitments and lenders under the Existing Credit
Facilities and the holders of the Notes offered hereby and the Existing Notes in the applicable required percentage
could institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets that constitute the Collateral, and we may seek protection
under the bankruptcy code.

If we breach our covenants under the Indenture, the Existing Credit Agreement, the Unsecured Notes Indenture,
the Secured Notes Indenture or under any agreements governing future senior credit facilities or other indebtedness,
we may need to request waivers from the required percentage of lenders or required percentage of noteholders to avoid
being in default. If we are unable to obtain a waiver from the lenders or noteholders, we would be in default under the
instrument governing that indebtedness, the lenders or noteholders could exercise their rights as described above, and
we may seek protection under the bankruptcy code.

_Our ability to service and repay the Notes will be dependent on the cash flow generated by our subsidiaries and events_
_beyond our control._

The Issuer’s only material asset is its interest in its subsidiaries. The Issuer conducts its operations through, and
most of its assets are owned by, its subsidiaries, and its operating income and cash flow are generated by its
subsidiaries. As a result, repayment of the Notes will depend on our subsidiaries’ generation of cash flow, which will,
in turn, depend principally upon future operating performance, and our subsidiaries’ ability to make such cash
available to us, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. If our operating subsidiaries experience sufficiently adverse
changes in its financial position or results of operations, or we otherwise become unable to pay our debts as they
become due and obtain further credit, this could result in the commencement of insolvency proceedings. Any such
proceedings would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control,
will affect our ability to make payments on our debt. In particular, due to the seasonal nature of the beauty industry,
with the highest levels of consumer demand generally occurring during the holiday buying season in our second fiscal
quarter, our subsidiaries’ cash flow in the second half of the fiscal year may be less than in the first half of the fiscal
year, which may affect our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations, including to service the Notes offered hereby.
In addition, we earn a significant amount of our operating income, and hold a significant portion of our cash and
investments, in our foreign subsidiaries outside the United States. As of March 31, 2021, the amount of cash and cash
equivalents held outside of the United States by our foreign subsidiaries was $258.3 million. If our U.S. subsidiaries
are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations, including to service the Notes
offered hereby, we may need to repatriate additional earnings and we may be subject to a higher effective tax rate. If
we do not generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations, including payments on the Notes, we
may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as refinancing or restructuring our debt, selling assets,
reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital. Our ability to restructure or refinance

20


-----

our debt will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could
result in higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict
our business operations. The terms of the Indenture, the Existing Credit Agreement, the Unsecured Notes Indenture,
the Secured Notes Indenture or any existing debt instruments or future debt instruments that we may enter into may
restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. The inability of our subsidiaries to generate sufficient cash flow
to satisfy our debt service obligations, including the inability to service the Notes offered hereby, or to refinance our
obligations on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations, profitability, cash flows or liquidity financial and may impact our ability to satisfy
our obligations in respect of the Notes.

_We may incur substantially more debt, including secured debt, or take other actions that may affect our ability to_
_satisfy our obligations under the Notes._

Although the terms of the Indenture will restrict, and the terms of the Existing Credit Agreement, the Unsecured
Notes Indenture and Secured Notes Indenture restrict, our and our subsidiaries’ ability to incur additional indebtedness
and liens securing indebtedness, such restrictions are subject to several exceptions and qualifications. Accordingly,
we will be able to incur additional indebtedness, including secured debt, as permitted by the terms of the Indenture,
the Existing Credit Agreement, the Unsecured Notes Indenture and the Secured Notes Indenture. Such additional
indebtedness may be substantial. Our ability to recapitalize, incur additional debt and take a number of other actions
that are not prohibited by the terms of the Indenture, the Existing Credit Agreement, the Unsecured Notes Indenture
and the Secured Notes Indenture could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on the Notes when
due, and may also require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our
other indebtedness, which would reduce the availability of cash flow to fund our operations, working capital and
capital expenditures. In addition, if we incur any additional indebtedness that ranks pari passu in right of payment to
the Notes, the holders of that debt will be able to share ratably with the holders of such series of the Notes in any
proceeds distributed in connection with any insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding up
of us. If our subsidiaries that are not guaranteeing the Notes incur any indebtedness, all of such debt will be structurally
senior to the Notes, and the holders of that debt will benefit prior to the holders of the Notes in any proceeds distributed
in connection with any insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding up of any such entity.

_Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to_
_increase._

Borrowings under our Existing Credit Facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk.
As of March 31, 2021, after giving effect to the offering of the Notes offered hereby, the issuance and sale of the
Existing Secured Notes, in each case the use of proceeds therefrom and the creation of the New Revolving Credit
Facility, $1.0 billion, or approximately 18% of our total debt, would have been at variable rates of interest. We would
also have had $2.1 billion of secured borrowings available under our revolving credit facilities. If interest rates were
to increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness referred to above would increase even though
the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing
our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease. For every 10% increase or decrease in our interest rates, our (Loss)
income before income taxes for the twelve month period ended March 31, 2021 would have changed by approximately
$3.4 million, assuming that all other variables stayed the same. We are currently party to, and in the future, we may
enter into additional, interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments, in order
to reduce interest rate volatility. However, we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable
rate indebtedness, and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk.

_Our credit ratings may not reflect the risks of investing in the Notes._

Our credit ratings are an assessment by rating agencies of our ability to pay our debts when due and include many
subjective factors. Consequently, real or anticipated changes in our credit ratings will generally affect the value of the
Notes. Also, these credit ratings may not reflect the potential impact of risks relating to structure or marketing of the
Notes. Agency ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any security and may be revised or withdrawn at
any time by the issuing organization. Each agency’s rating should be evaluated independently of any other agency’s
rating. There can be no assurance that our credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such
ratings will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency, if, in that rating agency’s judgment,
circumstances so warrant. There can also be no assurance that our credit ratings will reflect all of the factors that would
be important to holders of the Notes. Actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any

21


-----

announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade, could affect the value of the Notes, may
increase our borrowing costs and may negatively impact our ability to incur additional debt. The reports of the rating
agencies do not form a part of, and are not incorporated by reference into, this offering memorandum.

_Redemption may adversely affect your return on the Notes._

The Notes are redeemable at our option, and therefore we may choose to redeem the Notes at times when
prevailing interest rates are relatively low. As a result, you may not be able to reinvest the proceeds you receive from
the redemption in a comparable security at an effective interest rate as high as the interest rate on your Notes being
redeemed.

_We may not be able to purchase the Notes upon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event, which would_
_result in a default under the Indenture and would adversely affect our business and financial condition._

Upon the occurrence of a “Change of Control Triggering Event” within the meaning of the Indenture with respect
to the Notes, we will be required to repurchase all or any part of such holder’s Notes of such series at 101% of the
principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but excluding the purchase date. We may not
have sufficient funds available to make any required repurchases of the Notes, and we may be unable to receive
distributions or advances from our subsidiaries in the future sufficient to meet such repurchase obligation. In addition,
a change of control triggering event may also accelerate obligations to repurchase amounts outstanding under our and
our subsidiaries’ indebtedness and require us (or our subsidiaries), among other things, to make similar offerings in
respect of our and their outstanding indebtedness. In addition, restrictions under future debt instruments may not
permit us to repurchase the Notes. If we fail to repurchase the Notes in that circumstance, we will be in default under
the Indenture. If, due to a default, the repayment of related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable
notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay such indebtedness or the Notes. See “Description
of Notes—Repurchase of Notes Upon a Change of Control Triggering Event.”

_Some significant restructuring transactions may not constitute a change of control triggering event, in which case we_
_would not be obligated to offer to purchase the affected Notes._

Upon the occurrence of a “Change of Control Triggering Event” within the meaning of the Indenture with respect
to the Notes, holders of the Notes have the right to require us to purchase their Notes. However, the “Change of Control
Triggering Event” provisions will not afford protection to holders of Notes in the event of certain transactions. For
example, transactions such as leveraged recapitalizations, refinancings, restructurings or acquisitions initiated by us
may not constitute a “Change of Control Triggering Event” requiring us to purchase the Notes. Further, various
transactions might not constitute a “Change of Control Triggering Event” under the Notes but could constitute a
change of control triggering event as defined under our other debt. In the event of any such transaction, the holders
would not have the right to require us to purchase the Notes, even though such transaction could increase the amount
of our indebtedness, or otherwise adversely affect our capital structure or any credit ratings, thereby adversely
affecting the holders of Notes.

_The ability of holders of the Notes to require us to repurchase the Notes as a result of a disposition of “substantially_
_all” assets may be uncertain._

The definition of “Change of Control Triggering Event” in the Indenture will include a phrase relating to sale,
lease, transfer or other conveyance, in one or a series of related transactions, of “all or substantially all” of the assets
of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the
phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly,
the ability of a holder of the Notes to require us to repurchase such Notes as a result of a sale, transfer, conveyance or
other disposition of less than all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries taken as a whole to another person or
group may be uncertain.

_Many of the covenants in the Indenture will not apply to us if the Notes have investment grade ratings from at least_
_two of Moody’s, S&P and Fitch and no default has occurred and is continuing._

Many of the covenants in the Indenture will not apply to us if the Notes have investment grade ratings from at
least two of Moody’s, S&P and Fitch and no default has occurred and is continuing. There can be no assurance that
the Notes will ever be rated investment grade, or that if they are rated investment grade, that the Notes will maintain

22


-----

these ratings. However, suspension of these covenants would allow us to engage in certain transactions that would not
be permitted while these covenants were in effect. To the extent the covenants are subsequently reinstated, any such
actions taken while the covenants were suspended would not result in an event of default under the Indenture. See
“Description of Notes—Covenant Suspension.”

_A trading market for the Notes may not develop._

The Notes are a new issue of securities for which there currently is no market. In addition, the Notes are subject
to certain restrictions on resale and transfer as described under “Transfer Restrictions.” We intend to apply for the
listing of and permission to deal in the Notes on the Official List of TISE. However, we cannot guarantee that the
application to list the Notes on the Official List of TISE will be approved as of the issue date or any date thereafter,
that the permission to deal in the Notes will be granted or that the listing of the Notes will be maintained, and settlement
of the Notes is not conditioned on obtaining this listing. TISE is not a regulated market for the purposes of MiFID II.

The initial purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by applicable
law. They are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes and any market-making may be discontinued at
any time at their sole discretion. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the development or liquidity of any
market for the Notes. If a market develops, the Notes could trade at prices that may be lower than the initial offering
price of the Notes. Further, if an active market does not develop or is not maintained, the price and liquidity of the
Notes may be adversely affected. Historically, debt markets have been subject to disruptions that have caused
substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. The market, if any, for the Notes may not be free
from similar disruptions, and any such disruptions may adversely affect the prices at which holders of the Notes may
sell their Notes. In addition, subsequent to their initial issuance, the Notes may trade at a discount from their initial
offering price, depending upon prevailing interest rates, the market for similar notes, our performance and other
factors.

_Not all of our subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes, and your right to receive payment on the Notes will be structurally_
_subordinated to the liabilities of our non-guarantor subsidiaries._

Not all of our subsidiaries will be required to guarantee the Notes. The Notes will be guaranteed by the Issuer and
the Guarantors, which do not include foreign subsidiaries and certain U.S. subsidiaries excepted from providing
guarantees under the terms of the Existing Credit Agreement. Creditors of our non-guarantor subsidiaries will
generally be entitled to payment from the assets of those subsidiaries before those assets can be distributed for the
benefit of noteholders. As a result, the Notes will be structurally subordinated to the prior payment of all of the existing
and future debt and other liabilities of our non-guarantor subsidiaries. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or
reorganization of any of our non-guarantor subsidiaries, holders of their indebtedness will generally be entitled to
payment of their claims from the assets of those subsidiaries before any assets are made available for distribution to
the Issuer or the Guarantors of the Notes. Our guarantor subsidiaries, under our Existing Credit Agreement, include
our United States subsidiaries other than Younique, LLC (sold in August 2019) and King Kylie, LLC (acquired in
January 2020). For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 and nine months ended March 31, 2021, the U.S. Subsidiaries
had net revenues to third parties from continuing operations of $1,234 million and $1,069 million, respectively. In
addition, as of June 30, 2020 and March 31, 2021, the U.S. Subsidiaries had Long-lived Assets of $3,118 million and
$2,979 million, respectively. Long-lived Assets include property and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets.

Unless they are Guarantors, our subsidiaries will not have any obligation to pay amounts due on the Notes or to
make funds available for that purpose. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make
distributions or debt repayments to enable us to make payments in respect of the Notes. Each such subsidiary is a
distinct legal entity and may be subject to legal or contractual restrictions that, under certain circumstances, may limit
our ability to obtain cash from them. In the event that we do not receive sufficient cash from our subsidiaries, we will
be unable to make required principal, premium, if any, and interest payments on the Notes.

_There are restrictions on your ability to transfer or resell the Notes. In addition, holders of the Notes will not be_
_entitled to registration rights, and we do not currently intend to register the Notes under applicable securities laws._

The Notes are being offered and sold pursuant to exemptions from registration under the Securities Act and
applicable state securities laws. Therefore, you may transfer or resell the Notes in the United States only in a
transaction registered under or exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state
securities laws, and you may be required to bear the risk of your investment for an indefinite period of time. You may

23


-----

not offer or sell the Notes except under an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration
requirements of the Securities Act, and we do not intend to register the Notes for resale or to offer to exchange the
Notes for registered notes under the Securities Act. By purchasing the Notes, you will be deemed to have made certain
acknowledgements, representations and agreements as set forth under “Transfer Restrictions.”

_Federal and state statutes allow courts, under specific circumstances, to avoid the Notes and the guarantees, to require_
_holders of the Notes to return payments received from us or the Guarantors, and to take other actions detrimental to_
_the holders of the Notes._

Federal and state fraudulent transfer and conveyance statutes may apply to the issuance of the Notes, the delivery
of any guarantees of the Notes, including the guarantees by the Guarantors entered into upon issuance of the Notes,
and any subsidiary guarantees that may be entered into thereafter under the terms of the Indenture. Under federal
bankruptcy law and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer or conveyance laws, which may vary from state
to state, the issuance of the Notes and the delivery of guarantees could be avoided (that is, canceled) as fraudulent
transfers or conveyances if a court determined that we, at the time we issued the Notes, or any of the Guarantors, at
the time it delivered the applicable guarantee (or, in some jurisdictions, at the time payment became due under the
Notes or a guarantee),

(I) issued the Notes or provided the applicable guarantee, as the case may be, with the intent of hindering,

delaying or defrauding any present or future creditor; or

(II) (A) received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for issuing the Notes or providing

such guarantee, as the case may be, and

(B) (1) was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such issuance or provision,

(2) was engaged in a business or transaction for which the Issuer’s or such Guarantor’s remaining assets

constituted unreasonably small capital, or

(3) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they

matured.

A court would likely find that the Issuer or a Guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair
consideration for the Notes or the applicable guarantee if the Issuer or such Guarantor did not benefit directly or
indirectly from the issuance of the Notes or such guarantee. As a general matter, subject to the standards noted above,
value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or obligation, property is transferred or an
antecedent debt is secured or satisfied. If the Notes or guarantees are avoided or limited under fraudulent transfer or
other laws, any claim you may make against the Issuer or the Guarantors for amounts payable on the Notes or
guarantees, as the case may be, will be unenforceable to the extent of such avoidance or limitation.

We cannot be certain as to the standards a court would use to determine whether the Issuer or a Guarantor was
solvent at the relevant time that, if applicable in a particular jurisdiction, may be when payment became due under the
Notes or a guarantee. Regardless of the actual standard applied by the court, we cannot be certain that the issuance of
the Notes or a guarantee would not be avoided.

The measures of insolvency for purposes of these fraudulent transfer laws will vary depending upon the law
applied in any proceeding to determine whether a fraudulent transfer has occurred. Generally, however, the Issuer or
a Guarantor would be considered insolvent if:

  - the sum of its debts, including contingent and unliquidated liabilities, was greater than the value of its
property, at a fair valuation;

  - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable
liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or

  - it could not pay its debts as they become due.

To the extent that a court avoids or otherwise finds the Notes or a guarantee unenforceable for any other reason,
your claims against the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor would be eliminated or limited. In addition, the court might

24


-----

direct you to repay any amounts already received from the Issuer or such Guarantor. Further, the avoidance of the
Notes or a related guarantee could result in an event of default with respect to our other debt that, in turn, could result
in acceleration of such debt.

In certain circumstances, a court may subordinate claims in respect of the Notes or a guarantee to all other debts
of an Issuer or a Guarantor, or take other actions detrimental to the noteholders, based on equitable or other grounds.
We cannot be certain as to the standards that a court might apply and whether it might find such subordination or other
actions appropriate.

If a guarantee were legally challenged, such guarantee could also be subject to the claim that, since the guarantee
was incurred for the Issuer’s benefit, and only indirectly for the benefit of the Guarantor, the obligations of the
Guarantor were incurred for less than fair consideration. A court could thus avoid the obligations under the guarantee.
Although each guarantee will contain a provision intended to limit that Guarantor’s liability to the maximum amount
that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its guarantee to be a fraudulent transfer, that
provision may not be effective to protect those guarantees from being avoided under fraudulent transfer law, or may
reduce that Guarantor’s obligation to an amount that effectively makes its guarantee worthless.

Even if the guarantees of the Notes remain in force, the remaining amount due and collectible under the guarantee
may not be sufficient to pay the Notes in full when due.

_Because each Guarantor’s liability under its guarantees may be reduced to zero, avoided or released under certain_
_circumstances, you may not receive any payments from some or all of the Guarantors._

You have the benefit of the guarantees of the Guarantors. However, the guarantees by the Guarantors are limited
to the maximum amount that the Guarantors are permitted to guarantee under applicable law. As a result, a Guarantor’s
liability under its guarantee could be reduced to zero, depending on the amount of other obligations of such Guarantor.
Further, under the circumstances discussed more fully above, a court under Federal or state fraudulent conveyance
and transfer statutes could void the obligations under a guarantee or further subordinate it to all other obligations of
the Guarantor. In addition, you will lose the benefit of a particular guarantee if it is released under certain
circumstances described under “Description of Notes—Guarantees.”

_Holders of the Notes may be subject to the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, as well as possible_
_exchange controls, relating to the U.S. dollar and the euro._

The initial investors in the Notes will be required to pay for the Notes in euro. Neither we nor the initial purchasers
will be obligated to assist the initial investors in obtaining euro or in converting other currencies into euro to facilitate
the payment of the purchase price for the Notes. An investment in any security denominated in, and all payments with
respect to which are to be made in, a currency other than the currency of the country in which an investor in the Notes
resides or the currency in which an investor conducts its business or activities (the “investor’s home currency”), entails
significant risks not associated with a similar investment in a security denominated in the investor’s home currency.
In the case of the Notes offered hereby, these risks may include the possibility of:

  - significant changes in rates of exchange between the euro and the investor’s home currency; and

  - the imposition or modification of foreign exchange controls with respect to the euro or the investor’s home
currency.

We have no control over a number of factors affecting the Notes offered hereby and foreign exchange rates,
including economic, financial and political events that are important in determining the existence, magnitude and
longevity of these risks and their effects. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates between two currencies result
from the interaction over time of many factors directly or indirectly affecting economic and political conditions in the
countries issuing such currencies, and economic and political developments globally and in other relevant countries.
Foreign currency exchange rates may be affected by, among other factors, existing and expected rates of inflation,
existing and expected interest rate levels, the balance of payments between countries, and the extent of the
governmental surpluses or deficits in various countries. All of these factors are, in turn, sensitive to the monetary,
fiscal and trade policies pursued by the governments of various countries important to international trade and finance.
Moreover, the recent global economic volatility and the actions taken or to be taken by various national governments

25


-----

in response to the volatility could significantly affect the exchange rates between the euro and the investor’s home
currency.

The exchange rate of an investor’s home currency for euro and the fluctuations in the exchange rate that have
occurred in the past are not necessarily indicative of the exchange rates or the fluctuations therein that may occur in
the future. Depreciation of the euro against the investor’s home currency would result in a decrease in the investor’s
home currency equivalent yield on a Note, in the investor’s home currency equivalent of the principal payable at the
maturity of that Note and generally in the investor’s home currency equivalent market value of that Note. Appreciation
of the euro in relation to the investor’s home currency would have the opposite effects. The European Union or one
or more of its member states may, in the future, impose exchange controls and modify any exchange controls imposed,
which controls could affect exchange rates, as well as the availability of the euro at the time of payment of principal
of, interest on, or any redemption or additional amounts with respect to, the Notes.

This description of foreign exchange risks does not describe all the risks of an investment in securities, including,
in particular, the Notes, that are denominated or payable in a currency other than an investor’s home currency. You
should consult your own financial and legal advisors as to the risks involved in an investment in the Notes.

_Trading in the clearing system is subject to minimum denomination requirements._

The Notes will be issued with a minimum denomination of €100,000 and multiple of €1,000 in excess of
€100,000. It is possible that the clearing systems may process trades that could result in amounts being held in
denominations smaller than the minimum denominations. If definitive Notes are required to be issued in relation to
such Notes in accordance with the provisions of the relevant global notes, a holder who does not have the minimum
denomination or a multiple of €1,000 in excess of €100,000, as applicable, in its account with the relevant clearing
stem at the relevant time may not receive all of its entitlement in the form of definitive Notes unless and until such
time as its holding satisfies the minimum denomination requirement.

_In a lawsuit for payment on the Notes, an investor may bear currency exchange risk._

The Notes will be governed by New York law. Under New York law, a New York state court rendering a judgment
on the Notes would be required to render the judgment in euro. However, the judgment would be converted into U.S.
dollars at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of entry of the judgment. Consequently, in a lawsuit for payment
on the Notes, investors would bear currency exchange risk until a New York state court judgment is entered, which
could be a long time from the date the judgment is rendered. In courts outside of New York, investors may not be able
to obtain a judgment in a currency other than U.S. dollars. For example, a judgment for money in an action based on
the Notes in many other U.S. federal or state courts ordinarily would be enforced in the United States only in U.S.
dollars. The date used to determine the rate of conversion of euro into U.S. dollars will depend upon various factors,
including which court renders the judgment.

_The Notes permit us to make payments in U.S. dollars if we are unable to obtain euro._

We will pay the principal of and interest on each Note to the registered holder in euro in immediately available
funds, provided that, if on or after the issuance of the Notes, the euro is unavailable to us due to the imposition of
exchange controls or other circumstances beyond our control or if the euro is no longer being used by the then-member
states of the European Monetary Union that have adopted the euro as their currency or for the settlement of transactions
by public institutions of or within the international banking community, then all payments in respect of the Notes will
be made in U.S. dollars until the euro is again available to us or so used. In such circumstances, the amount payable
on any date in euro will be converted into U.S. dollars at the rate mandated by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board as the
close of business on the second business day prior to the relevant payment date or, in the event of the U.S. Federal
Reserve Board has not mandated a rate of conversion, on the basis of the then-most recent U.S. dollar/euro exchange
rate available on or prior to the second business day prior to the relevant payment date as determined by us in our sole
discretion. Any payment in respect of the Notes so made in U.S. dollars will not constitute an event of default under
the Notes or the Indenture. See “Description of Notes—Terms of the Notes.” This exchange rate may be materially
less favorable than the rate in effect at the time the Notes were issued or as would be determined by applicable law.
Such developments, or market perceptions concerning these and related issues, could materially adversely affect the
value of the Notes and you may lose a significant amount of your investment in the Notes.

26


-----

_Certain considerations relating to book-entry interests._

The Notes will initially only be issued in global certificated form and held through Euroclear and Clearstream.
Interests in the Global Notes (as such term is defined in “Book-Entry, Settlement and Clearance”) will trade in bookentry form only. Unless and until the Notes in definitive registered form are issued in exchange for book-entry
interests, owners of book-entry interests will not be considered owners or holders of the Notes. The common
depositary (or its nominee) for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream will be the registered holder of the Global
Notes. Payments in respect of the Global Notes representing the Notes (including principal, premium, interest and
additional amounts, if any) will be made to the paying agent. The paying agent will then make such payments to the
common depositary (or its nominee) for Euroclear and Clearstream. The common depositary (or its nominee) will in
turn distribute such payments to participants in accordance with its procedures. After payment to the common
depositary (or its nominee), we, the Trustee and the paying agent will have no responsibility or liability for the payment
of interest, principal or other amounts to the owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly, if you own a book-entry
interest, you must rely on the procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, and if you are not a participant
in Euroclear or Clearstream, on the procedures of the participant through which you own your interest, to exercise any
rights and obligations of a holder of notes under the Indenture. See “Book-Entry, Settlement and Clearance.”

Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right to act
upon our solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes. Instead, if you
own a book-entry interest, you will be permitted to act only to the extent you have received appropriate proxies to do
so from Euroclear or Clearstream or, if applicable, a participant. There can be no assurance that procedures
implemented for the granting of such proxies will be sufficient to enable you to vote on any request actions on a timely
basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture, unless and until notes in definitive
registered form are issued in respect of all book entry interests, if you own a book entry interest, you will be restricted
to acting through Euroclear or Clearstream. We, the Trustee and the paying agent cannot assure you that the procedures
to be implemented through Euroclear or Clearstream will be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of rights under the
Notes. See “Book-Entry, Settlement and Clearance.”

**Risks related to the Collateral**

_Even though the holders of the Notes will benefit from a lien on the Collateral that secures our Existing Credit_
_Facilities and the Existing Secured Notes, the representative of the lenders under our Existing Credit Agreement_
_initially controls actions with respect to the Collateral. If required to do so pursuant to applicable law, the Collateral_
_Agent may release the Collateral securing the Notes automatically, without your consent or the consent of the Trustee._

On the closing date of this offering, the Notes will be secured by liens on the same Collateral that secures our
obligations under the Existing Credit Facilities and the Existing Secured Notes. Under the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement, however, the ability to cause the commencement of enforcement proceedings against such Collateral, to
control such proceedings and certain decisions in a bankruptcy proceeding will be at the direction of the authorized
representative of the lenders under the Existing Credit Agreement governing our Existing Credit Facilities until the
expiration of a standstill period.

In addition, subject to certain limitations, the Existing Credit Agreement, the Secured Notes Indenture permit,
and the Indenture will permit, us to issue up to a certain amount of additional debt that also has a first-priority lien on
the same Collateral. At any time that the representative of the lenders under our Existing Credit Agreement does not
have the right to take actions with respect to the Collateral pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, that right passes
to the authorized representative of the holders of the next largest outstanding principal amount of indebtedness secured
by a first-priority lien on the Collateral. Our Existing Credit Facilities will be the largest portion as of the issue date.
The authorized representative for such indebtedness would be next in line to exercise rights under the Intercreditor
Agreement, rather than the authorized representative for the Notes.

Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the authorized representative of the holders of the Notes may not object
following the filing of a bankruptcy petition to any debtor-in-possession financing or to the use of any cash collateral
to secure that financing, in each case that has been consented to by the representative of the lenders under the Existing
Credit Agreement governing the Existing Credit Facilities or the applicable authorized representative, subject to

27


-----

conditions and limited exceptions. After such a filing, the value of this Collateral could materially deteriorate, and the
holders of the Notes would be unable to raise an objection.

In addition, under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Collateral Agent may be required to release or subordinate
liens pursuant to applicable law under a final and nonappealable order or judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction,
without your consent or the consent of the Trustee.

_It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral._

No appraisal of the value of the Collateral securing the Notes has been made in connection with this offering and
the fair market value of the Collateral is subject to fluctuations based on factors that include, among others, market
and other economic conditions, including the availability of suitable buyers. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral
may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. We cannot assure you that the fair market value
of the Collateral as of the date of this offering memorandum exceeds, or at any other point in time will exceed, the
principal amount of the debt secured thereby. The value of the Collateral and the guarantees could be impaired in the
future as a result of changing economic conditions, our failure to implement our business strategy, competition,
liabilities and other future events. Accordingly, there may not be sufficient Collateral to pay all or any of the amounts
due on the Notes or the other debt secured by first-priority liens on the Collateral, including the obligations under our
Existing Credit Agreement and Existing Secured Notes. Any claim for the difference between the amount, if any,
realized by holders of the Notes and the other holders of first-priority liens on the Collateral from the sale of the
Collateral and the obligations of the Issuer and Guarantors under the Notes will be equal in right of payment with all
of our other unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness and other obligations, including trade payables. Additionally, in
the event that a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding is commenced by or against us, if the value of the Collateral is
less than the amount of principal and accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes and all other pari passu senior secured
obligations, interest may cease to accrue on the Notes from and after the date such proceedings are commenced or
initiated. Also, any disposition of the Collateral during a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding outside of the ordinary
course of our business would require approval from the bankruptcy court (which may not be given under certain
circumstances).

To the extent that third parties enjoy prior liens on any of the Collateral or are able to attach liens to any of the
Collateral, such third parties may have rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral that, if exercised, could
adversely affect the value of the Collateral. Additionally, the terms of the Indenture will allow us to (i) issue additional
secured indebtedness, including additional debt that may be _pari passu in the Collateral with the Notes, and (ii) to_
incur refinancing indebtedness in certain circumstances. The Indenture will not require that we maintain the current
level of Collateral value or maintain a specific ratio of indebtedness to asset values. Under the Indenture, any such
additional secured indebtedness may be pari passu in the Collateral with the Notes and be entitled to the same rights
and priority with respect to the Collateral. Thus, the issuance of any such additional debt and refinancing indebtedness
may have the effect of significantly diluting your ability to recover payment in full of the Notes from the then-existing
pool of Collateral. Releases of Collateral from the liens securing the Notes will be permitted under certain
circumstances. See “Description of Notes—Security—Release of Liens.”

In the future, the obligation to grant additional security over assets, or a particular type or class of assets, whether
as a result of the acquisition or creation of future assets or subsidiaries, the designation of a previously unrestricted
subsidiary or otherwise, will be subject to the provisions of the Indenture and the Security Documents (as defined
below), including the Intercreditor Agreement. Furthermore, upon enforcement against any Collateral or during a
bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding, under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the claims of the holders of the
Notes to the proceeds thereof will rank equally with the claims of the holders of obligations under the Existing Credit
Agreement, the Existing Secured Notes and any other indebtedness that is secured on a first-priority basis by the
Collateral. The security interest of the Collateral Agent on behalf of the holders of the Notes is subject to practical
problems generally associated with the realization of security interests in collateral. For example, the consent of a
third party may be necessary to obtain or enforce a security interest in a contract and such consent may not be provided.
Also, the consents of any third parties may not necessarily be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure or
realization on the Collateral. Accordingly, the Collateral Agent may not have the ability to foreclose or realize upon
those assets and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease.

28


-----

_Holders of the Notes may not be able to fully realize the value of their liens._

The security interests and liens for the benefit of holders of the Notes may be released without such holders’
consent in specified circumstances. In particular, the Security Documents generally provide for an automatic release
of all liens on any asset securing the Notes, the Existing Secured Notes or our Existing Credit Facilities on a firstpriority basis that is disposed of in compliance with the provisions of the Existing Credit Agreement governing our
Existing Credit Facilities, the Secured Notes Indenture and the Indenture. As a result, we cannot assure holders of the
Notes that the Notes will continue to be secured by a substantial portion of our assets.

Moreover, the Collateral Agent may need to evaluate the impact of potential liabilities before determining to
foreclose on Collateral consisting of real property because secured creditors that hold a security interest in real property
may be held liable under environmental laws for the costs of remediating or preventing the release or threatened
release of hazardous substances at such real property. Consequently, the Collateral Agent may decline to foreclose on
such Collateral or exercise remedies available in respect thereof if it does not receive indemnification to its satisfaction
from the holders of the Notes.

In addition, all or a portion of the Collateral may be released:

  - to enable the sale, transfer or other disposal of such Collateral in a transaction not prohibited under the
Indenture, the Secured Notes Indenture or the Existing Credit Agreement governing our Existing Credit
Facilities, including the sale of assets in accordance with the asset sale covenant and the sale of any entity in
its entirety that owns or holds such Collateral; and

  - with respect to Collateral held by a Guarantor, upon the release of such Guarantor from its guarantee.

In addition, the guarantee of a Guarantor will be released in connection with a transfer of such Guarantor in a
transaction not prohibited by the Indenture or upon certain other events. See “Description of Notes—Certain
Covenants—Asset Sales” and “Description of Notes—Security—Release of Liens.”

The Indenture will permit us to designate one or more of our restricted subsidiaries as an unrestricted subsidiary.
If we designate a Guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary, all of the liens on any Collateral owned by such subsidiary
or any of its subsidiaries and any guarantees of the Notes by such subsidiary or any of its subsidiaries will be released
under the Indenture. Designation of a subsidiary as unrestricted will reduce the aggregate value of the Collateral to
the extent that liens on the assets of the unrestricted subsidiary and its subsidiaries are released. In addition, the
creditors of the unrestricted subsidiary and its subsidiaries will have a senior claim on the assets of such unrestricted
subsidiary and its subsidiaries.

_The Collateral may not be valuable enough to satisfy all of the obligations secured by such Collateral._

The Notes, our Existing Secured Notes and our Existing Credit Facilities are secured on a first-priority lien basis
(subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens) by substantially all of the assets of the Company and any existing
and future Guarantors, including all of the capital stock of the Company and each restricted subsidiary, but excluding
all of the assets of our non-guarantor subsidiaries. The actual value of the Collateral at any time will depend upon
market and other economic conditions.

In addition, the asset sale covenant and the definition of asset sale in the Indenture will have a number of
significant exceptions pursuant to which we will be able to sell Collateral securing the Notes without being required
to reinvest the proceeds of such sale into assets that will comprise Collateral or to make an offer to the holders of the
Notes to repurchase the Notes.

The value of the Collateral in the event of a liquidation will depend upon market and economic conditions, the
availability of buyers and similar factors. No independent appraisals of any of the Collateral have been prepared by
or on behalf of us in connection with the offering of the Notes. Accordingly, we cannot assure holders of the Notes
that the proceeds of any sale of the Collateral following an acceleration to maturity with respect to the Notes would
be sufficient to satisfy, or would not be substantially less than, amounts due on the Notes and the other debt secured
thereby. If the proceeds of any sale of the Collateral were not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes, the
holders of the Notes (to the extent their Notes were not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the pledged assets)
would have only an unsecured claim against our remaining assets. By their nature, some or all of the Collateral may

29


-----

be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Likewise, we cannot assure holders of the Notes that
the Collateral will be saleable or, if saleable, that there will not be substantial delays in their liquidation. To the extent
that liens, rights and easements granted to third parties encumber assets located on property owned by us or constitute
subordinate liens on the pledged assets, those third parties may have or may exercise rights and remedies with respect
to the property subject to such encumbrances (including rights to require marshalling of assets) that could adversely
affect the value of the Collateral located at that site and the ability of the Collateral Agent to realize or foreclose on
the Collateral at that site.

Moreover, the Indenture will permit us to issue additional secured debt, including debt secured equally and ratably
by the same assets pledged for the benefit of the holders of the Notes, subject to certain limitations. This could reduce
amounts payable to holders of the Notes from the proceeds of any sale of the Collateral.

_The Collateral will be subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections that_
_may exist in respect of the security interests required with respect to the Existing Credit Agreement._

The Collateral will be subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections that
may exist in respect of the security interests required with respect to the Existing Credit Agreement. In addition, there
will be no requirement to make any foreign security filings outside of the United States in respect of the Collateral.
The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections or lack of filings could
adversely affect the value of the Collateral as well as the ability of the Collateral Agent to realize or foreclose on the
Collateral for the benefit of the holders of the Notes. The initial purchasers have neither analyzed the effect of, nor
participated in any negotiations relating to, such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and imperfections, including
the lack of any such filing in foreign jurisdictions outside of the United States, and the existence thereof could
adversely affect the value of the Collateral as well as the ability of the Collateral Agent to realize or foreclose on the
Collateral for the benefit of the holders of the Notes.

_Rights of the holders of the Notes in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect liens on certain_
_Collateral acquired in the future._

Applicable law requires that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest, such
as real property, equipment subject to a certificate and certain proceeds, can only be perfected at the time such property
and rights are acquired and identified. Furthermore, in certain jurisdictions, “blanket” or “floating” liens will not be
available to secure any Collateral. Neither the Collateral Agent nor the Trustee will monitor, and we may not inform
the Collateral Agent or the Trustee of, the future acquisitions of property and rights that constitute Collateral, and
necessary action may not be taken to properly perfect the security interest in such after-acquired Collateral. Neither
the Collateral Agent nor the Trustee has any obligation to monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights that
constitute Collateral or the perfection of any security interest in favor of the Notes against third parties. As a result,
the inability or failure of the Issuer or any Guarantor to promptly take all actions necessary to create properly perfected
security interests in the Collateral may result in the loss of the priority, or a defect in the perfection, of the security
interest for the benefit of the holders of the Notes to which they would have been otherwise entitled. In addition, as
described further herein, even if the liens on Collateral acquired in the future are properly perfected, such liens may
potentially be avoidable as a preference in any bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding under certain circumstances. See
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to this Offering and the Notes—Federal and state statutes allow courts, under specific
circumstances, to avoid the Notes and the guarantees, to require holders of the Notes to return payments received from
us or the Guarantors, and to take other actions detrimental to the holders of the Notes.”

_The Collateral is subject to casualty risks._

Although we maintain insurance policies to insure against losses, there are certain losses that may be either
uninsurable or not economically insurable, in whole or in part. As a result, it is possible that the insurance proceeds
will not compensate us fully for our losses in the event of a catastrophic loss. If there is a total or partial loss of any of
the Collateral, we cannot assure you that any insurance proceeds received by us will be sufficient to satisfy all the
secured obligations, including the Notes.

30


-----

_We will, in most cases, have control over the Collateral, and the sale of particular assets by us could reduce the pool_
_of assets securing the Notes and any future guarantees. In addition, certain assets, including Excluded Assets, will be_
_excluded from the Collateral, and certain other liens will be permitted to exist on our assets, including the Collateral._

The terms of the Security Documents, the Existing Credit Agreement, the Secured Notes Indenture allow, and the
Indenture will allow, us to remain in possession of, retain exclusive control over, freely operate, and collect, invest
and dispose of any income from, the Collateral. For example, in accordance with the Security Documents, the Existing
Credit Agreement, the Secured Notes Indenture and the Indenture, we may, among other things, without approval or
consent of the Collateral Agent or the Trustee, conduct activities with respect to Collateral, such as selling, factoring,
abandoning or otherwise disposing of Collateral and making cash payments (including repayments of indebtedness).
The lien on any Collateral will be automatically released upon any permitted disposition thereof to a person that is not
an Issuer or a Guarantor and, in such event, will no longer secure the obligations under the Indenture. See “Description
of Notes—Security—Release of Liens.”

In addition, certain assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors, including Excluded Assets, will be excluded from the
Collateral, and other liens will be permitted to exist on our assets, including the Collateral, in each case as provided
in the Indenture and the Security Documents. See “Description of Notes—Security.”

_To the extent lien searches are performed, such searches may not reveal all existing liens on the Collateral._

We cannot guarantee that any lien searches conducted on the Collateral will reveal all existing liens on the
Collateral. Any existing undiscovered lien could be significant, could be prior in ranking to the liens securing the
Notes or the guarantees and could have an adverse effect on the ability of the Collateral Agent to realize or foreclose
upon the Collateral. In addition, certain statutory priority liens may also exist that cannot be discovered by lien
searches.

_Rights of the holders of the Notes in the Collateral may be adversely affected by bankruptcy and insolvency_
_proceedings and the holders of the Notes may not be entitled to post-petition interest, fees, or expenses in any_
_bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding._

The right of the Collateral Agent to repossess and dispose of the Collateral is likely to be significantly impaired,
and at a minimum delayed, if U.S. bankruptcy proceedings are commenced by or against us prior to or possibly even
after the Collateral Agent has repossessed and disposed of the Collateral. Under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, pursuant
to the automatic stay imposed upon a bankruptcy filing, secured creditors, such as the Collateral Agent, are prohibited
from repossessing its security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from disposing of security repossessed from a
debtor, without prior bankruptcy court approval (which may not be given under the circumstances). Moreover, U.S.
bankruptcy law permits the debtor to continue to retain and to use collateral, and the proceeds, products, rents or
profits of collateral, even though the debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments, provided that the
secured creditor is given “adequate protection.” The meaning of the term “adequate protection” may vary according
to circumstances, but it is intended in general to protect the value of the secured creditor’s interest in Collateral and
may include cash payments or the granting of additional or replacement security, if and at such time as the court in its
discretion determines, for any diminution in the value of Collateral as a result of the stay of repossession or disposition
or any use of collateral by the debtor during the pendency of the bankruptcy case. A bankruptcy court may determine
that a secured creditor does not require compensation for diminution in the value of its collateral if the value of such
collateral exceeds the debt it secures. In view of the lack of a precise definition of the term “adequate protection” and
the broad discretionary powers of a U.S. bankruptcy court, it is impossible to predict whether or when payments under
the Notes could be delayed following the commencement of a bankruptcy case (or the length of the delay in making
any such payments), whether or when the Collateral Agent would repossess or dispose of the Collateral, or whether
or to what extent the holders of the Notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the
Collateral through the requirements of “adequate protection.”

Furthermore, in the event a U.S. bankruptcy court determines that the value of the Collateral is not sufficient to
repay all amounts due on the Notes, the Existing Secured Notes the Existing Credit Agreement and any additional
obligations of the Company or any guarantor secured by the Collateral on a first-priority basis, the holders of the Notes
would have “undersecured claims” as to the difference. Generally, U.S. bankruptcy laws do not permit the payment
or accrual of post-petition interest, costs, expenses and attorneys’ fees for “undersecured claims” during the debtor’s
bankruptcy case. Other consequences of a finding of under-collateralization would include, among other things, a lack
of entitlement to receive “adequate protection” under U.S. bankruptcy laws with respect to any unsecured portion of

31


-----

the Notes. In addition, if any payments of post-petition interest had been made at the time of such a finding of undercollateralization, those payments could be recharacterized by a U.S. bankruptcy court as a reduction of the principal
amount of the Notes.

The rights of the Collateral Agent with respect to the Collateral may also be impaired, delayed or otherwise
affected by the insolvency laws of the other jurisdictions in which we and the Guarantors are incorporated or
organized.

_In the event of a bankruptcy of us or any of the Guarantors, holders of the Notes may be deemed to have an unsecured_
_claim to the extent that our obligations in respect of the Notes exceed the fair market value of the Collateral securing_
_the Notes._

In any bankruptcy proceeding with respect to us or any of the Guarantors, it is possible that the bankruptcy trustee,
the debtor-in-possession or competing creditors will assert that the fair market value of the Collateral with respect to
the Notes on the date of the bankruptcy filing was less than the then-current principal amount of the Notes. Upon a
finding by the bankruptcy court that the Notes are under-collateralized, the claims in the bankruptcy proceeding with
respect to the Notes would be bifurcated between a secured claim and an unsecured claim, and the unsecured claim
would not be entitled to the benefits of security in the Collateral. Other consequences of a finding of undercollateralization would be, among other things, a lock of entitlement on the part of the Notes to receive post-petition
interest and a lock of entitlement on the part of the unsecured portion of the Notes to receive other “adequate
protection” under federal bankruptcy laws. In addition, if any payments of post-petition interest had been made at the
time of such a finding of under-collateralization, those payments could be recharacterized by the bankruptcy court as
a reduction of the principal amount of the secured claim with respect to the Notes.

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

We expect to receive net proceeds of approximately €490 million from the sale of the Notes, after deducting the
initial purchasers’ discount and other offering expenses payable by us. We intend to use the net proceeds of this
offering to repay a portion of the term loans outstanding under the Existing Credit Facilities and to pay any related
premiums, fees and expenses thereto. We will use cash on hand to pay the offering expenses payable by us in
connection with this offering.

As of June 1, 2021, we had approximately $3,388 million aggregate principal amount outstanding under our
Existing Credit Facilities, including $960 million of outstanding term A loans, $1,483 million of outstanding term B
loans and $945 million under our revolving credit facilities. The existing term loans mature by April 2023 and April
2025. The weighted average interest rate for the loans outstanding under the existing term loans is currently 2.1%.

Certain of the initial purchasers or their respective affiliates may hold a portion of the outstanding term loans
under the Existing Credit Facilities and therefore may receive a portion of the proceeds of this offering. See
“Description of Other Indebtedness” and “Plan of Distribution” for more information.

**DESCRIPTION OF OTHER INDEBTEDNESS**

_The following section summarizes the terms of our principal indebtedness. It does not purport to be complete and_
_is subject to, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, the underlying documents._

**The Existing Credit Agreement**

On April 5, 2018, the Company entered into a new credit agreement (including subsequent amendments described
below, if applicable, the “Existing Credit Agreement”), which amended and restated its prior credit agreement. The
Existing Credit Agreement provided for (a) the incurrence by the Company of (1) a senior secured term A facility in
an aggregate principal amount of (i) $1,000.0 million denominated in U.S. dollars and (ii) €2,035.0 million
denominated in euros and (2) a senior secured term B facility in an aggregate principal amount of (i) $1,400.0 million
denominated in U.S. dollars and (ii) €850.0 million denominated in euros; and (b) the incurrence by the Company and
Coty B.V., a Dutch subsidiary of the Company (the “Dutch Borrower”), of a senior secured revolving credit facility
in an aggregate principal amount of $3,250.0 million denominated in U.S. dollars, specified alternative currencies or
other currencies freely convertible into U.S. dollars and readily available in the London interbank market. Initial
borrowings under the senior secured term B facility were issued at a 0.250% discount. The Existing Credit Agreement
was modified by each of the 2019 Amendment, the 2020 Amendment and the 2021 Amendment described below.

The Existing Credit Agreement provides that with respect to the then existing revolving credit facility, up to
$150.0 million is available for letters of credit and up to $150.0 million is available for swing line loans. The Existing
Credit Agreement also permits, subject to certain terms and conditions, the incurrence of incremental facilities
thereunder in an aggregate amount of (i) $1,700.0 million plus (ii) an unlimited amount if the First Lien Net Leverage
Ratio (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement), at the time of incurrence of such incremental facilities and after
giving effect thereto on a pro forma basis, is less than or equal to 3.00 to 1.00.

The obligations of the Company under the Existing Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the Guarantors and the
obligations of the Company and the Guarantors under the Existing Credit Agreement are secured by a perfected firstpriority lien on substantially all of the assets of the Company and the Guarantors, subject to certain exceptions. The
Dutch Borrower does not guarantee the obligations of the Company under the Existing Credit Agreement or grant any
liens on its assets to secure any obligations under the Existing Credit Agreement.

On June 27, 2019, the Company entered into an amendment (the “2019 Amendment”) to the Existing Credit
Agreement. The 2019 Amendment modified the Existing Credit Agreement by (x) amending the financial covenant
to (i) delay until the test period ending March 31, 2022 the “Total Net Leverage Ratio” step down from 5.25 to 5.00,
(ii) extend the applicable window for certain cost savings add-backs in the calculation of “Adjusted EBITDA” for
purposes of determining the “Total Net Leverage Ratio,” and (iii) amend the determination of the exchange rate to be
used in the calculation of “Total Indebtedness” for purposes of determining the “Total Net Leverage Ratio,” and (y)
decreasing the total commitments under the then existing revolving credit facility by $500.0 million to $2,750.0
million.

On April 29, 2020, the Company entered into an additional amendment (the “2020 Amendment”) to further
modify the Existing Credit Agreement by, among other things, (i) providing a financial covenant “holiday” through
the test period ended March 31, 2021, (ii) establishing a minimum liquidity covenant through March 31, 2021 of
$350.0 million, which increased to $500.0 million as a result of the prepayment event related to the sale of the Wella
Business, and (iii) placing limitations on our ability to make certain investments and restricted payments (including
our ability to pay dividends in cash) and to incur additional secured indebtedness, in each case through March 31,
2021. The 2020 Amendment did not modify the applicable funding costs during the period through March 31, 2021.
The limitations on the Company’s activities imposed by the 2020 Amendment and the financial covenant “holiday”
are no longer applicable.

On June 4, 2021, the Company entered into an additional amendment (the “2021 Amendment”) to further modify
the Existing Credit Agreement by, among other things, creating the New Revolving Credit Facility as a new class of
revolving commitments in an aggregate principal amount of $700.0 million, which commitments will mature in April
2025. The effectiveness of such new class of commitments is conditioned upon the reduction of the commitments
under the Company’s then existing revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $700.0 million.

35


-----

**Existing Unsecured Notes**

On April 5, 2018, the Company issued, at par, $550 million of 6.50% senior unsecured notes due 2026 (the “2026
Dollar Notes”), €550.0 million of 4.00% senior unsecured notes due 2023 (the “2023 Euro Notes”) and €250.0 million
of 4.75% senior unsecured notes due 2026 (the “2026 Euro Notes” and, together with the 2023 Euro Notes, the “Euro
Notes”) in a private offering.

The Existing Unsecured Notes are senior unsecured debt obligations of the Company and are pari passu in right
of payment with all of the Company’s existing and future senior indebtedness (including the Existing Credit Facilities,
the Existing Secured Notes and the Notes offered hereby). The Existing Unsecured Notes are guaranteed, jointly and
severally, on a senior basis by the Guarantors. The Existing Unsecured Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the
Company and are effectively junior to all existing and future indebtedness of the Company to the extent of the value
of the collateral securing such secured indebtedness. The related guarantees are senior unsecured obligations of each
Guarantor and are effectively junior to all existing and future secured indebtedness of such Guarantor to the extent of
the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness.

The 2026 Dollar Notes mature on April 15, 2026. Interest on the 2026 Dollar Notes is payable semi-monthly in
arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year. The 2023 Euro Notes mature on April 15, 2023 and the 2026 Euro
Notes mature on April 15, 2026. Interest on the Euro Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on April 15 and October
15 of each year. Upon the occurrence of certain change of control triggering events with respect to a series of Existing
Unsecured Notes, the Company will be required to offer to repurchase all or part of such series at 101% of their
principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the purchase date applicable to such
Existing Unsecured Notes. The Unsecured Notes Indenture contains customary covenants that place restrictions in
certain circumstances on, among other things, incurrence of liens, entry into sale or leaseback transactions, sale of all
or substantially all of the Company’s assets and certain merger or consolidation transactions. The Unsecured Notes
Indenture also provides for customary events of default.

**Existing Secured Notes**

On April 21, 2021, the Company issued, at par, $900 million of 5.000% senior secured notes due 2026 in a private
offering.

The Existing Secured Notes are senior secured obligations of the Company and are guaranteed on a senior secured
basis by each of the Company’s wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries that guarantees the Company’s obligations under the
Existing Credit Facilities and are secured by first-priority liens on the same collateral that secures the Company’s
obligations under the Existing Credit Facilities. The Existing Secured Notes and the guarantees are equal in right of
payment with all of the Company’s and its guarantors’ respective existing and future senior indebtedness (including
the Existing Unsecured Notes, Existing Credit Facilities and the Notes offered hereby) and are pari passu with all of
the Company’s and the guarantors’ respective existing and future indebtedness that is secured by a first priority lien
on the collateral, including the Existing Credit Facilities and the Notes offered hereby, to the extent of the value of the
such collateral.

The Existing Secured Notes are redeemable at the option of the Company, in whole or in part, at any time on or
prior to April 15, 2023 at 100% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus a “make-whole” premium and accrued
and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. The redemption price for the Existing Secured
Notes that are redeemed on or after April 15, 2023 will be equal to the redemption prices set forth in the Secured Notes
Indenture, together with any accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. In addition, the Company may redeem
up to 40% of the Existing Secured Notes using the proceeds of certain equity offerings completed before April 15,
2023. Upon the occurrence of certain change of control triggering events with respect to the Existing Secured Notes,
the Company will be required to offer to repurchase such Existing Secured Notes at a purchase price equal to 101%
of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the purchase date applicable
to the Notes.

The Secured Notes Indenture contains covenants that limit the ability of the Company and any of its restricted
subsidiaries to, among other things:

  - sell, transfer or otherwise convey any assets;

36


-----

- incur additional indebtedness, guarantee indebtedness or issue disqualified stock or, in the case of such
subsidiaries, preferred stock;

- pay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect of their capital stock or make other restricted
payments;

- make certain investments or acquisitions;

- sell, transfer or otherwise convey certain assets;

- create liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions;

- enter into agreements restricting certain subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany
transfers;

- consolidate, merger, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its
restricted subsidiaries;

- enter into certain transactions with affiliates; and

- prepay certain kinds of indebtedness.

The Secured Notes Indenture also provides for customary events of default.

**DESCRIPTION OF NOTES**

_The terms of the Notes (as defined below) will include those set forth in the Indenture (as defined below). You_
_should carefully read the summary below and the provisions of the Indenture that may be important to you before_
_investing in the Notes. This summary is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Indenture, the_
_Notes and the Security Documents. We urge you to read the Indenture, the Notes and the Security Documents because_
_they, not this description, define your rights as holders of the Notes._

Certain terms used in this description are defined under the subheading “—Certain Definitions.” In this
description, references to “Coty,” “us,” “we,” “our” or the “Company” refer only to Coty Inc. and not to any of its
Subsidiaries.

**General**

The Company will issue €500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of % Senior Secured Notes due 2026 (the
“Notes”) under an indenture (the “Indenture”), to be entered into by and among the Company, the Guarantors,
Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee (in such capacity, the “Trustee”), the Collateral Agent (as defined
below), and Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as paying agent. The registered holder of a Note will be treated as
its owner for all purposes. Only registered holders will have rights under the Indenture.

Unless previously redeemed or repurchased and cancelled, the Company will repay the Notes in cash at 100% of
their principal amount together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon at maturity.

The Notes will be the senior secured debt obligations of the Company and will be pari passu in right of payment
with all of the Company’s other existing and future senior Indebtedness.

The Notes will be entitled to the benefits of the Note Guarantees described under “—Guarantees.”

The Notes will be redeemable by the Company at any time prior to maturity at the redemption prices and in the
manner described below under “—Optional Redemption.” Not later than 30 days following a Change of Control
Triggering Event with respect to the Notes, the Company will be required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes at
a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes on the date of repurchase plus accrued and unpaid interest,
if any, to, but excluding, the Change of Control Payment Date.

The Company may from time to time, without notice to or the consent of the holders or beneficial owners of the
Notes, but subject to compliance with the covenants described below, create and issue additional Notes (“Additional
Notes”) of the same series as the Notes offered hereby, having the same terms (except for the Issue Date and, in some
case, the initial issue price and the first interest payment date) and be equal with the Notes in all respects (or in all
respects other than the payment of interest accruing prior to the Issue Date of such Additional Notes except for the
first payment of interest following the Issue Date of such Additional Notes); provided that if such Additional Notes
are not fungible with the Notes offered hereby for U.S. federal income tax purposes, then such Additional Notes will
have a separate CUSIP number. Such Additional Notes will be consolidated and form a single series with the Notes
offered hereby and be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture, including, without limitation,
waivers, consents, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase. Unless expressly stated or the context otherwise
requires, references in this “Description of Notes” to the “Notes” include any Additional Notes issued under the
Indenture that are treated as a single class with the Notes described herein.

The Notes will not be subject to a sinking fund. The Notes, the Indenture and the Note Guarantees will be subject
to defeasance as described under “—Defeasance” and the Indenture will be subject to satisfaction and discharge as
described under “—Satisfaction and Discharge.”

If the scheduled maturity date or interest payment date for the Notes falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the
payment of interest and principal will be made on the next succeeding Business Day as if made on the date such
payment was due, and no interest on such payment shall accrue for the period from and after the scheduled maturity
date or interest payment date, as the case may be on account of such delay.

Interest on the Notes will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.

38


-----

The Notes will not be entitled to any registration rights, and the Company does not intend to register the Notes
for resale or to offer to exchange the Notes for registered Notes under the U.S. federal or state securities laws or the
securities laws of any other jurisdiction.

**_Terms of the Notes_**

The Notes will mature on, 2026.

Initial holders of the Notes will be required to pay for the Notes in euro, and the Company will pay principal of,
premium, if any, and interest, including payments made upon any redemption or offer to purchase, on the Notes in
euro. If, on or after the issuance of the Notes, the euro is unavailable to the Company due to the imposition of exchange
controls or other circumstances beyond its control or if the euro is no longer being used by the then member states of
the EMU that have adopted the euro as their currency or for the settlement of transactions by public institutions of or
within the international banking community, then all payments in respect of the Notes will be made in U.S. dollars
until the euro is again available to the Company or so used. In such circumstances, the amount payable on any date in
euro will be converted into U.S. dollars at the rate mandated by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board as of the close of
business on the second Business Day prior to the relevant payment date or, in the event the U.S. Federal Reserve
Board has not mandated a rate of conversion, on the basis of the then most recent U.S. dollar/euro exchange rate
available on or prior to the second Business Day prior to the relevant payment date as determined by the Company in
its sole discretion. Any payment in respect of the Notes so made in U.S. dollars will not constitute an event of default
under the Notes or the Indenture. Neither the Trustee nor the paying agent shall have any responsibility for any
calculation or conversion in connection with the foregoing. Investors will be subject to foreign exchange risks as to
payments of principal and interest, including payments made upon any redemption of Notes, that may have important
economic and tax consequences to them. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to this Offering and the Notes” in this
offering memorandum. In the circumstances described above, the Company and the Trustee shall be permitted, without
the consent of any other Person, to amend the terms of the Indenture and the Notes to change the currency in which
the obligations of the Company hereunder are payable in a manner consistent with then-prevailing market practice for
similarly situated issuers. See “—Modification and Waiver.”

The Notes will be issued in registered, book-entry form only without interest coupons in minimum denominations
of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

The Notes will bear interest at a rate of % per annum. Interest on the Notes will accrue from the Issue Date, or
from the most recent interest payment date to which interest has been paid or provided for, to, but excluding, the
relevant interest payment date. The Company will make interest payments on the Notes semi-annually in arrears on
and of each year (each an “interest payment date”), beginning on    , 2021, to the Person in whose
name such Notes are registered at the close of business on the immediately preceding or (each a “record
date”), as applicable.

The Company intends to apply to The International Stock Exchange Authority for the listing of the Notes on the
Official List of The International Stock Exchange (the “TISE”). There can be no assurance that the Notes will be listed
on the TISE and admitted for trading on the exchange market. Accordingly, the Company cannot assure you that any
active trading market for the Notes will develop or be maintained. There is currently no market for the Notes. This
offering of the Notes is not contingent upon obtaining this listing.

**Guarantees**

The Company’s Subsidiaries that Guarantee the Credit Agreement will initially Guarantee the Company’s
obligations under the Indenture and the Notes.

Each of the Guarantors will jointly and severally Guarantee the Company’s obligations under the Indenture and
the Notes on a senior secured basis. The obligations of each Guarantor under its Note Guarantee will be limited as
necessary to prevent its Note Guarantee from constituting fraudulent conveyances or fraudulent transfers under
applicable law; this limitation, however, may not be effective to prevent such Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent
conveyance. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to this Offering and the Notes—Federal and state statutes allow courts,
under specific circumstances, to avoid the Notes and the guarantees, to require holders of the Notes to return payments
received from us or the Guarantors, and to take other actions detrimental to the holders of the Notes.”

39


-----

Each Guarantor may consolidate with or merge into or sell its assets to the Company or another Guarantor without
limitation, or with, into or to any other Persons upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Indenture. See “—
Certain Covenants—Consolidation, Merger and Conveyance, Transfer and Lease of Assets.”

The Note Guarantee of a Guarantor will be automatically and unconditionally released without any further action
by any Person in the event that:

(1) there is a sale, disposition or other transfer (including through merger or consolidation) of all of the Capital

Stock (or any sale, disposition or other transfer of Capital Stock (including through merger or consolidation)
following which the applicable Guarantor is no longer a Subsidiary, including by way of a dividend of the
Capital Stock of such Guarantor to the stockholders of the Company), or all or substantially all the assets, of
the applicable Guarantor to a Person that is not a Subsidiary of the Company where such sale, disposition or
other transfer is not prohibited by the Indenture;

(2) if the Company exercises its legal defeasance option or its covenant defeasance option as described under

“—Defeasance” or if its obligations under the Indenture are discharged in accordance with the terms of the
Indenture as described under “—Satisfaction and Discharge”;

(3) in the case of the Note Guarantees issued on the Issue Date, upon the release or discharge of the Guarantee

by such Guarantor of Indebtedness under the Credit Agreement, or, in all other cases, the release or discharge
of such other Guarantee that resulted in the creation of such Note Guarantee, except, in each case, a discharge
or release by or as a result of payment under such Guarantee (it being understood that a release subject to a
contingent reinstatement is still a release, and that if any such Guarantee is so reinstated, such Note Guarantee
shall also be reinstated to the extent that such Subsidiary would then be required to provide a Note Guarantee
pursuant to the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants— Additional Guarantees”); provided that
the Guarantees by such Guarantor of the Existing Notes are also released at or prior to such time; or

(4) the proper designation of any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary.

For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 and nine months ended March 31, 2021, our Guarantors (which include
our Subsidiaries in the United States other than Younique (sold in August 2019) and Kylie (acquired in January 2020)),
had net revenues to third parties from continuing operations of $1,234 million and $1,069 million, respectively. In
addition, as of June 30, 2020 and March 31, 2021, such Guarantors had Long-lived Assets of $3,118 million and
$2,818 million, respectively. Long-lived Assets include property and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets.
See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to this Offering and the Notes—Not all of our subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes,
and your right to receive payment on the Notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of our non-guarantor
subsidiaries.”

**Priority**

The Notes:

  - will be senior secured obligations of the Company, secured by a perfected first-priority Lien (subject to
Permitted Liens) on the Collateral referred to below;

  - will be _pari passu_ in right of payment with all existing and future senior Indebtedness of the Company
(including the Credit Agreement and the Existing Notes);

  - will be effectively pari passu with all existing and future Indebtedness secured by a first-priority Lien on the
Collateral (including the Credit Agreement and the Existing Secured Notes);

  - will be effectively senior to all existing and future unsecured Indebtedness of the Company (including the
Existing Unsecured Notes) to the extent of the value of the Collateral;

  - will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future Indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade
payables) of the Company’s Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors; and

40


-----

  - will be senior in right of payment to all existing and future Indebtedness of the Company that is expressly
subordinated to the Notes.

The Note Guarantees of each Guarantor:

  - will be senior secured obligations of such Guarantor;

  - will be pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future senior Indebtedness of such Guarantor
(including its respective Guarantees of the Credit Agreement and the Existing Notes);

  - will be effectively _pari passu_ with all existing and future Indebtedness of such Guarantor secured by a
perfected first-priority Lien (subject to Permitted Liens) on the Collateral (including its respective Guarantees
of the Credit Agreement and the Existing Secured Notes);

  - will be effectively senior to all existing and future unsecured Indebtedness of such Guarantor (including its
respective Guarantee of the Existing Unsecured Notes) to the extent of the value of the Collateral;

  - will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future Indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade
payables) of such Guarantor’s Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors; and

  - will be senior in right of payment to all existing and future Indebtedness of such Guarantor that is expressly
subordinated to the Note Guarantee of such Guarantor.

At March 31, 2021, after giving effect to this offering and the use of proceeds therefrom, and the other transactions
described under “Use of Proceeds” in this offering memorandum:

(1) the Company and the Guarantors would have had outstanding $5.4 billion in aggregate principal amount of

Indebtedness (including the Notes and the Existing Notes), of which $3.9 billion in aggregate principal
amount would have been secured Indebtedness, including the Notes and the Existing Secured Notes, and
approximately $2.1 billion of additional secured borrowings would have been available and undrawn under
the Credit Agreement (excluding $10.3 million of outstanding letters of credit); and

(2) the Company and the Guarantors would have had $1.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior

unsecured Indebtedness outstanding, including the Existing Unsecured Notes.

**Security**

**_General_**

The Notes and the Note Guarantees of the Guarantors will be secured by a perfected First-Priority Lien (subject
to Permitted Liens) on all tangible and intangible assets of the Company and each Guarantor, other than Excluded
Assets (collectively, the “Collateral”).

The Collateral will be pledged to Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as collateral agent (together with any
successor or assign, the “Collateral Agent”), on a first-priority basis (subject to Permitted Liens), for the benefit of the
Trustee under the Indenture and the holders of the Notes (and the other secured parties contemplated by the
Intercreditor Agreement). The Indenture will permit the Company and the Guarantors to create additional Liens under
specified circumstances, including certain additional Liens on the Collateral that may rank equally with the Liens
securing the Notes or, in certain circumstances, senior to such Liens. See the definition of “Permitted Liens.”

The Collateral will not include (collectively, “Excluded Assets”), in each case so long as not pledged to secure
the Credit Agreement:

(a) (x) any fee owned real property and (y) any real property leasehold rights and interests;

(b) motor vehicles, aircraft and other assets subject to certificates of title;

(c) commercial tort claims that, in the reasonable determination of the Company, are not expected to result in a

judgment in excess of $10,000,000;

41


-----

(d) letter of credit rights (other than to the extent consisting of supporting obligations that can be perfected solely

by the filing of a Uniform Commercial Code financing statement (it being understood that no actions shall
be required to perfect a security interest in letter of credit rights other than filing of a Uniform Commercial
Code financing statement));

(e) any governmental licenses or state or local franchises, charters and authorizations, to the extent a security

interest in any such license, franchise, charter or authorization is prohibited or restricted thereby (excluding
any prohibition or restriction that is ineffective under the Uniform Commercial Code);

(f) assets to the extent the pledge thereof or grant of security interests therein (x) is prohibited or restricted by

applicable law, rule or regulation, (y) would cause the destruction, invalidation or abandonment of such asset
under applicable law, rule or regulation, or (z) requires any consent, approval, license or other authorization
of any third party or governmental authority (excluding any prohibition or restriction that is ineffective under
the Uniform Commercial Code);

(g) any “Excluded Equity Interest,” which shall be defined to include (i) margin stock, (ii) Equity Interests of

any Person other than the Company or any Wholly Owned Subsidiary that is a Material Subsidiary and that
is a Restricted Subsidiary directly owned by the Company or any Guarantor (other than any Equity Interests
in King Kylie, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, owned by the Company or any Guarantor), (iii)
Equity Interests of any Material Subsidiary that is a Wholly Owned Foreign Subsidiary or CFC Holdco
directly owned by the Company or any Guarantor in excess of 65% of such Material Subsidiary’s issued and
outstanding Equity Interests, (iv) any Equity Interest to the extent the pledge thereof would be prohibited by
any law or contractual obligation (excluding any prohibition or restriction that is ineffective under the
Uniform Commercial Code), (v) any Equity Interests with respect to which the Company and the Collateral
Agent have reasonably determined that the cost or other consequences (including material adverse tax
consequences) of pledging or perfecting a security interest in such Equity Interests are excessive in relation
to the benefit to the secured parties of the security to be afforded thereby, (vi) the Equity Interests of any
Excluded Subsidiary (other than any Foreign Subsidiary or CFC Holdco), and (vii) any other Equity Interests
that otherwise constitute Excluded Assets;

(h) Excluded Accounts;

(i) any lease, license or agreement, or any property subject to a purchase money security interest, capital lease

obligation or similar arrangement, in each case to the extent that a grant of a security interest therein would
violate or invalidate such lease, license or agreement or purchase money or similar arrangement or create a
right of termination in favor of any other party thereto (other than the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary)
or otherwise require consent thereunder (other than from the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary) after giving
effect to the applicable anti-assignment provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code, other than proceeds
and receivables thereof, the assignment of which is expressly deemed effective under the Uniform
Commercial Code notwithstanding such prohibition;

(j) any assets to the extent a security interest in such assets would result in material adverse tax consequences

as reasonably determined by the Company;

(k) any intent-to-use application trademark application prior to the filing, and acceptance by the U.S. Patent and

Trademark Office, of a “Statement of Use” or “Amendment to Allege Use” with respect thereto, to the extent,
if any, that, and solely during the period, if any, in which, the grant of a security interest therein would impair
the validity or enforceability of such intent-to-use trademark application under applicable federal law;

(l) assets where the cost of obtaining a security interest therein is excessive in relation to the practical benefit to

the holders of the Notes afforded thereby as reasonably determined between the Company and the Collateral
Agent; and

(m) any acquired property (including property acquired through acquisition or merger of another entity) if at the

time of such acquisition the granting of a security interest therein or the pledge thereof is prohibited by any
contract or other agreement (in each case, not created in contemplation thereof) to the extent and for so long
as such contract or other agreement prohibits such security interest or pledge (excluding any prohibition or
restriction that is ineffective under the Uniform Commercial Code).

42


-----

The Company shall not be required to create or perfect pledges of, or security interests in, or taking other actions
with respect, to any Excluded Assets.

The Collateral Agent shall, at the written direction of the holders, grant extensions of time for the perfection of
security interests in particular assets and the delivery of assets where perfection cannot be accomplished without undue
effort or expense by the time or times at which it would otherwise be required and any extensions of time or waivers
as are granted by the Credit Agreement Agent (as defined below) or the administrative agent under the Credit
Agreement for the comparable requirement under the Credit Agreement or any related loan document shall
automatically be granted under the Indenture and the Security Documents.

No actions required by the laws of any non-U.S. jurisdiction shall be required in order to create any security
interests in any assets or to perfect or make enforceable such security interests (including any intellectual property
registered in any non-U.S. jurisdiction) (it being understood that there shall be no security agreements or pledge
agreements governed under the laws of any non-U.S. jurisdiction or any requirement to make any filings in any foreign
jurisdiction including with respect to foreign intellectual property).

No actions shall be required with respect to assets requiring perfection through control agreements or perfection
by “control” (as defined in the UCC) (other than in respect of Indebtedness for borrowed money (other than
intercompany Indebtedness)) owing to the Company or any Guarantor that is evidenced by a note in excess of
$7,500,000, Indebtedness of any Non-Guarantor Subsidiary that is owing to the Company or any Guarantor and
certificated Equity Interests of wholly owned Restricted Subsidiaries that are Material Subsidiaries otherwise required
to be pledged pursuant to the Security Agreement. In addition, neither the Company nor any Guarantor shall be
required to take any action not taken for the Credit Agreement (so long as such Credit Agreement is in place).

**_After-Acquired Property_**

If property (other than Excluded Assets) is acquired by the Company or any Guarantor that is not automatically
subject to a perfected security interest under the applicable Security Documents or a Restricted Subsidiary (including
a newly created one) becomes a Guarantor, then the Company or such Guarantor will, as applicable, promptly (but in
any event within 60 days after such property’s acquisition or such Subsidiary becoming a Guarantor provide security
over such property (or, in the case of a new Guarantor, all of its assets except Excluded Assets)) in favor of the
Collateral Agent, cause the Liens to be duly perfected and deliver certain certificates, opinions, title insurance and
surveys in respect thereof as and to the extent required by the Indenture and the Security Documents; provided that
any extensions of time or waivers as are granted by the Credit Agreement Agent for the comparable requirement under
the Credit Agreement or any related loan document shall automatically be granted under the Indenture and the Security
Documents.

**_Control over Collateral; Value of Collateral and Enforcement of Liens_**

The Security Documents will provide that, subject to certain terms and conditions, the Company and the
Guarantors are entitled to remain in possession and retain exclusive control over the Collateral (other than as set forth
in the Security Documents).

Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Security Documents will provide that
the Collateral Agent may foreclose upon and sell the applicable Collateral and distribute the net proceeds of any such
sale to the Trustee and the holders of the Notes and other First-Priority Obligations, subject to the Security Documents,
the Intercreditor Agreement (as defined below), applicable laws and applicable governmental requirements.

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, proceeds realized from the Collateral or in an insolvency proceeding
will be applied:

  - _first, to amounts owing to the Collateral Agent and one or more Authorized Representatives (as defined_
below), in their capacities as such in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement until such
amounts are paid in full;

  - _second, to amounts owing to the holders of all First-Priority Obligations on a ratable basis in accordance with_
their respective terms; and

43


-----

  - _third, to the Company and the Guarantors and/or other persons entitled thereto._

The Collateral has not been appraised in connection with this offering. The fair market value of the Collateral is
subject to fluctuations based on factors that include, among others, the condition of the industry in which the Company
operates, its ability to implement its business strategy, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, general
economic conditions and similar factors. The amount to be received upon a sale of the Collateral would be dependent
on numerous factors, including but not limited to the actual fair market value of the Collateral at such time, the timing
and the manner of the sale and certain regulatory limits. By its nature, portions of the Collateral may be illiquid and
may have no readily ascertainable market value. Likewise, there can be no assurance that the Collateral will be
saleable, or, if saleable, that there will not be substantial delays in its liquidation. In the event of a foreclosure,
liquidation, receivership, bankruptcy or similar proceeding, the Company cannot assure you that the proceeds from
any sale or liquidation of the Collateral will be sufficient to pay the Company’s and the Guarantors’ obligations under
the Notes.

To the extent that Liens (including Permitted Liens), rights or easements granted to third parties encumber assets
owned by the Company or the Guarantors, including the Collateral, such third parties may exercise rights and remedies
with respect to the property subject to such Liens that could adversely affect the value of the Collateral and the ability
of the Collateral Agent, the Trustee or the holders of the Notes to realize or foreclose on Collateral.

**_Intercreditor Agreement_**

The collateral agent under the Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement Agent”) and the collateral agent for the
Existing Secured Notes (the “Existing Secured Notes Collateral Agent”) entered into an intercreditor agreement with
respect to the Collateral, and the Collateral Agent, as an Authorized Representative, will enter into a joinder thereto
(as hereafter amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time (including by such joinder),
the “Intercreditor Agreement”). The Intercreditor Agreement may be amended from time to time, without the consent
of the Trustee and the holders of the Notes, to add other parties holding First-Priority Obligations permitted to be
incurred under the Indenture, the indentures governing the Existing Notes and the Credit Agreement.

The Intercreditor Agreement will govern the relative rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral of the
Credit Agreement Agent on behalf of itself, the administrative agent and the lenders under the Credit Agreement, the
Existing Secured Notes Collateral Agent on behalf of the trustee under the indenture governing the Existing Secured
Notes and the holders of the Existing Secured Notes, the Collateral Agent on behalf of the Trustee and the holders of
the Notes and the holders of any other First-Priority Obligations.

**_Control over Collateral and Enforcement of Liens_**

Under the Intercreditor Agreement, as described below, the “Controlling Authorized Representative” will have
the right to direct foreclosures and take other actions with respect to the Common Collateral, and the Authorized
Representatives of other series of First-Priority Obligations will have no right to take actions with respect to the
Common Collateral. The Controlling Authorized Representative will initially be the Credit Agreement Agent and
none of the Existing Secured Notes Collateral Agent, the Collateral Agent for the Trustee and the holders of the Notes,
as Authorized Representative in respect of the Notes, or the Authorized Representative of the holders of any other
First-Priority Obligations will initially have any rights to take any action with respect to the Common Collateral under
the Intercreditor Agreement. The Controlling Authorized Representative may, with the prior written consent of the
Company and the Guarantors, additionally enter into any amendment (and, upon request by the Controlling Authorized
Representative, the applicable Authorized Representative shall sign a consent to such amendment) to any Security
Document solely as such Security Document relates to a particular series of First-Priority Obligations (including,
without limitation, to release Liens securing such series of First-Priority Obligations); _provided_ that any such
amendment is in accordance with the agreements governing the First-Priority

Obligations pursuant to which such series of First-Priority Obligations was incurred and such amendment does
not adversely affect the First-Priority Secured Parties of any other series. The Controlling Authorized Representative
shall provide a copy of such amendment to the Trustee. The Controlling Authorized Representative shall provide a
copy of such amendment to each Non-Controlling Authorized Representative and to the Trustee.

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that if, in connection with any sale, lease, exchange, transfer or other
disposition of any Common Collateral permitted under the terms of the Secured Credit Documents (whether or not an

44


-----

Event of Default thereunder, and as defined therein, has occurred and is continuing), the Controlling Authorized
Representative, for itself or on behalf of the applicable First-Priority Secured Parties, releases any of its Liens on any
part of the Common Collateral (but not the proceeds thereof which shall be subject to the priorities set forth in the
Intercreditor Agreement), then the Liens, if any, of each Non-Controlling Authorized Representative on such Common
Collateral shall be automatically, unconditionally and simultaneously released, and each Non-Controlling Authorized
Representative promptly shall execute, if applicable, and deliver to the Controlling Authorized Representative or the
Company such termination statements, releases, authorizations and other documents and instruments, and shall take
or authorize the Controlling Authorized Representative or the Company to take such action (including any recordation,
filing or giving of notice), as the Controlling Authorized Representative or the Company may reasonably request to
effectively confirm such release.

The Credit Agreement Agent will remain the Controlling Authorized Representative until the earlier of (1) the
payment of Obligations under the Credit Agreement (other than contingent Obligations under the Credit Agreement
in respect of which no claim has been made) and (2) the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement
Date (provided that if there shall occur more than one Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date,
the applicable Authorized Representative shall be the Authorized Representative that is the Major Non-Controlling
Authorized Representative in respect of the most recent Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement
Date) (such earlier date, the “Applicable Authorized Agent Date”). From and after the Applicable Authorized Agent
Date, the Controlling Authorized Representative will be the Authorized Representative of the Non-Controlling
Secured Parties of the series of First-Priority Obligations that constitutes the largest outstanding principal amount of
any then outstanding series of First-Priority Obligations with respect to the Common Collateral (the “Major NonControlling Authorized Representative”).

The “Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date” is the date that is 180 days (throughout
which 180-day period the applicable Non-Controlling Authorized Representative was the Major Non-Controlling
Authorized Representative) after the occurrence of both (a) an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture or other
applicable indenture or agreement for that series of First-Priority Obligations, and (b) the Controlling Authorized
Representative’s and each other Authorized Representative’s receipt of written notice from that Authorized
Representative certifying that (i) such Non-Controlling Authorized Representative is the Major Non-Controlling
Authorized Representative and that an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture or other applicable indenture or
agreement for that series of First-Priority Obligations, has occurred and is continuing and (ii) the First-Priority
Obligations of that series are currently due and payable in full (whether as a result of acceleration thereof or otherwise)
in accordance with the Indenture or other applicable indenture or agreement for that series of First-Priority
Obligations; provided that the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date shall be stayed and shall
not occur and shall be deemed not to have occurred with respect to any Common Collateral (1) at any time the
Controlling Authorized Representative has commenced and is diligently pursuing any enforcement action with respect
to such Common Collateral or (2) at any time the Company or any Guarantor that has granted a security interest in
such Common Collateral is then a debtor under or with respect to (or otherwise subject to) any insolvency or
liquidation proceeding.

The Controlling Authorized Representative shall have the sole right to act or refrain from acting with respect to
enforcement proceedings in respect of the Common Collateral. The Controlling Authorized Representative shall not
follow any instructions with respect to such Common Collateral from any Authorized Representative of any NonControlling Secured Party or First-Priority Secured Party (other than the requisite Controlling Secured Parties under
the applicable Secured Credit Documents), and no Authorized Representative of any Non-Controlling Secured Party
or other First-Priority Secured Party (other than the requisite Controlling Secured Parties under the applicable Secured
Credit Documents) will instruct the Controlling Authorized Representative to commence any judicial or non-judicial
foreclosure proceedings with respect to, seek to have a trustee, receiver, liquidator or similar official appointed for or
over, attempt any action to take possession of, exercise any right, remedy or power with respect to, or otherwise take
any action to enforce its security interest in or realize upon, or take any other action available to it in respect of, the
Common Collateral.

Notwithstanding the equal priority of the Liens on the Common Collateral, the Controlling Authorized
Representative, acting on the instructions of the requisite Controlling Secured Parties under the applicable Secured
Credit Documents, may deal with the Common Collateral as if such Controlling Authorized Representative had a
senior Lien on such Collateral. No Authorized Representative of any Non-Controlling Secured Party or any NonControlling Secured Party may contest, protest or object to any foreclosure proceeding or action brought by the
Controlling Authorized Representative. The Collateral Agent and each other Authorized Representative will agree

45


-----

that it will not accept any Lien on any Common Collateral for the benefit of the holders of Notes or of any other series
of First-Priority Obligations, as applicable (other than funds deposited for the discharge or defeasance of the Indenture
or the agreement governing such other series of First-Priority Obligations, as applicable), other than pursuant to the
Security Documents and the security documents governing any other series of First-Priority Obligations (collectively,
the “First-Priority Collateral Documents”). Each of the First-Priority Secured Parties also will agree (and pursuant to
the Indenture the Trustee will be instructed to agree) that it will not (and will waive any right to) contest or support
any other person in contesting, in any proceeding (including any insolvency or liquidation proceeding), the perfection,
priority, validity or enforceability of a Lien held by or on behalf of any of the First-Priority Secured Parties in all or
any part of the Collateral, or the enforceability of the Intercreditor Agreement. The Intercreditor Agreement provides
that, if any Common Collateral is transferred to a third party or otherwise disposed of in connection with any
enforcement by the Controlling Authorized Representative thereunder and in accordance with the terms thereof and
the applicable First-Priority Collateral Documents, the Liens in favor of each Authorized Representative for the benefit
of each series of First-Priority Secured Parties upon such Common Collateral will be automatically released and
discharged.

If an Event of Default or any event of default with respect to any other First-Priority Obligations has occurred
and is continuing and the Controlling Authorized Representative or any First-Priority Secured Party is taking action
to enforce rights in respect of any Common Collateral, or any distribution is made in respect of any Common Collateral
in any bankruptcy case of the Company or any Guarantor or any First-Priority Secured Party receives any payment
pursuant to any intercreditor agreement (other than the Intercreditor Agreement) with respect to any Common
Collateral, the proceeds of any sale, collection or other liquidation of any such Collateral by any First-Priority Secured
Party or received by the Controlling Authorized Representative or any First-Priority Secured Party pursuant to any
such intercreditor agreement with respect to such Common Collateral and proceeds of any such distribution (subject,
in the case of any such distribution, to the paragraph immediately following) to which the First-Priority Obligations
are entitled under any other intercreditor agreement shall be applied among the First-Priority Obligations as set forth
under “—Control over Collateral and Enforcement of Liens” above.

None of the First-Priority Secured Parties may institute any suit or assert in any suit, bankruptcy, insolvency or
other proceeding any claim against the Controlling Authorized Representative or any other First-Priority Secured
Party seeking damages from or other relief by way of specific performance, instructions or otherwise with respect to
any Common Collateral. In addition, none of the First-Priority Secured Parties may seek to have any Common
Collateral or any part thereof marshaled upon any foreclosure or other disposition of such Collateral. If any FirstPriority Secured Party obtains possession of any Common Collateral or realizes any proceeds or payment in respect
thereof, at any time prior to the discharge of each series of First-Priority Obligations, then it must hold such Common
Collateral, proceeds or payment in trust for the other First-Priority Secured Parties and promptly transfer such
Common Collateral, proceeds or payment to the Controlling Authorized Representative to be distributed in accordance
with the Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Intervening Liens_**

Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Common Collateral for which a third party (other than a FirstPriority Secured Party and after giving effect to any other applicable intercreditor agreements) has a lien or security
interest that is junior in priority to the security interest of any series of First-Priority Obligations but senior (as
determined by appropriate legal proceedings in the case of any dispute) to the security interest of any other series of
First-Priority Obligations (such third party, an “Intervening Creditor”), the value of any Common Collateral or
proceeds which are allocated to such Intervening Creditor shall be deducted on a ratable basis solely from the Common
Collateral or proceeds to be distributed in respect of the series of First-Priority Obligations with respect to which such
impairment exists.

**_Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding_**

If the Company or any Guarantor becomes subject to any bankruptcy case, the Intercreditor Agreement provides
that, if the Company or any Guarantor shall, as debtor(s)-in-possession, move for approval of financing (the “DIP
Financing”) to be provided by one or more lenders (the “DIP Lenders”) under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code or
the use of cash collateral under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code, each First-Priority Secured Party (other than any
Controlling Secured Party or the Controlling Authorized Representative) will agree (and pursuant to the Indenture the
Trustee will be instructed to agree) not to object to any such DIP Financing or to the Liens on the Common Collateral
securing the same (the “DIP Financing Liens”) or to any use of cash collateral that constitutes Common Collateral,

46


-----

unless any Controlling Secured Party, or the Controlling Authorized Representative, shall then oppose or object to
such DIP Financing or such DIP Financing Liens or such use of cash collateral (and (i) to the extent that such DIP
Financing Liens are senior to the Liens on any such Common Collateral for the benefit of the Controlling Secured
Parties, each Non-Controlling Secured Party will subordinate its Liens with respect to such Common Collateral on the
same terms as the Liens of the Controlling Secured Parties (other than any Liens of any First-Priority Secured Parties
constituting DIP Financing Liens) are subordinated thereto, and (ii) to the extent that such DIP Financing Liens rank
_pari passu_ with the Liens on any such Common Collateral granted to secure the First-Priority Obligations of the
Controlling Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Secured Party will confirm the priorities with respect to such
Common Collateral as set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement), in each case so long as:

(A) the First-Priority Secured Parties of each series retain the benefit of their Liens on all such Common

Collateral pledged to the DIP Lenders, including proceeds thereof arising after the commencement of
such proceeding, with the same priority vis-a-vis all the other First-Priority Secured Parties (other than
any Liens of the First-Priority Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) as existed prior to the
commencement of the bankruptcy case;

(B) the First-Priority Secured Parties of each series are granted Liens on any additional collateral pledged to

any First-Priority Secured Parties as adequate protection or otherwise in connection with such DIP
Financing or use of cash collateral, with the same priority vis-a-vis the First-Priority Secured Parties as
set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement;

(C) if any amount of such DIP Financing or cash collateral is applied to repay any of the First-Priority

Obligations, such amount is applied pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement; and

(D) if any First-Priority Secured Parties are granted adequate protection, including in the form of periodic

payments, in connection with such DIP Financing or use of cash collateral, the proceeds of such adequate
protection is applied pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement;

_provided, that the First-Priority Secured Parties of each series shall have a right to object (and the Trustee will do so_
at the written direction of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes) to the grant of a Lien to secure
the DIP Financing over any Collateral subject to Liens in favor of the First-Priority Secured Parties of such series or
its Authorized Representative that shall not constitute Common Collateral; and provided, further, that the First-Priority
Secured Parties receiving adequate protection shall not object to any other First-Priority Secured Party receiving
adequate protection comparable to any adequate protection granted to such First-Priority Secured Parties in connection
with a DIP Financing or use of cash collateral.

The First-Priority Secured Parties shall acknowledge (and the Trustee pursuant to the Indenture shall be instructed
in writing to acknowledge) that the First-Priority Obligations of any series may, subject to the limitations set forth in
the other Secured Credit Documents, be increased, extended, renewed, replaced, restated, supplemented, restructured,
repaid, refunded, refinanced or otherwise amended or modified from time to time, all without affecting the priorities
set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement defining the relative rights of the First-Priority Secured Parties of any series.

As used in this section, the following terms have the meanings set out below:

“Authorized Representative” means (i) in the case of the Notes, the Collateral Agent, (ii) in the case of the Credit
Agreement, the Credit Agreement Agent, (iii) in the case of the Existing Secured Notes, the Existing Secured

Notes Collateral Agent and (iv) in the case of any other series of First-Priority Obligation that become subject to
the Intercreditor Agreement, the person named as the authorized representative for such series in the applicable joinder
agreement.

“Common Collateral” means, at any time, such portion of the Collateral in which the holders of two or more
series of First-Priority Obligations (or their respective Authorized Representatives) hold a valid and perfected security
interest at such time; provided that collateral consisting of cash and Cash Equivalents pledged to secure obligations in
respect of the Credit Agreement consisting of reimbursement obligations in respect of letters of credit or otherwise
held by the administrative agent thereunder pursuant to the letter of credit provisions of the credit agreement governing
the Credit Agreement (or any successor provision) shall be applied as specified in the credit agreement or such
successor provision and will not constitute Common Collateral. If more than two series of First-Priority Obligations

47


-----

are outstanding at any time and the holders of less than all series of First-Priority Obligations hold a valid and perfected
security interest in any portion of the Collateral at such time, then such portion of the Collateral shall constitute
Common Collateral for those series of First-Priority Obligations that hold a valid security interest in such portion of
the Collateral at such time and shall not constitute Common Collateral for any series which does not have a valid and
perfected security interest in such portion of the Collateral at such time.

“Controlling Authorized Representative” means, with respect to any Common Collateral, (i) until the

Applicable Authorized Agent Date, the Credit Agreement Agent and (ii) from and after the Applicable Authorized
Agent Date, the Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative (provided that if there shall occur more than one
Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date after the applicable Authorized Agent Date, the
Controlling Authorized Representative shall be the Authorized Representative that is the Major Non-Controlling
Authorized Representative in respect of the most recent Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement
Date).

“Controlling Secured Parties” means, with respect to any Common Collateral, the series of First-Priority Secured
Parties whose Authorized Representative is the Controlling Authorized Representative for such Common Collateral.

“First-Priority Secured Parties” means the persons holding any First-Priority Obligations, including the Collateral
Agent and the Trustee.

“Non-Controlling Authorized Representative” means any Authorized Representative that is not the Controlling
Authorized Representative.

“Non-Controlling Secured Parties” means, with respect to any Common Collateral, the First-Priority Secured
Parties which are not Controlling Secured Parties with respect to such Common Collateral.

**_Release of Liens_**

The Security Documents and the Indenture provide that the Liens securing the Note Guarantee of any Guarantor
will be automatically released when such Guarantor’s Note Guarantee is released in accordance with the terms of the
Indenture and/or the Security Documents. In addition, the Liens on the Collateral with respect to Obligations under
the Indenture, the Security Documents and the Notes will be released:

(1) upon defeasance or discharge of the Notes and the Indenture as provided under “Defeasance” and

“Satisfaction and Discharge”;

(2) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other Obligations (other than contingent Obligations in

respect of which no claims have been made) on the Notes issued under the Indenture;

(3) in whole or in part, in accordance with the provisions set forth under “Modification and Waiver”;

(4) in connection with any sale, transfer or other disposition of any Collateral to any Person other than the

Company or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries (but excluding any transaction subject to “—Certain
Covenants—Consolidation, Merger and Conveyance, Transfer and Lease of Assets” where the recipient is
required to become the obligor on the Notes or a Note Guarantee) that does not violate any of the terms of
the Indenture (with respect to the Lien on such Collateral);

(5) in whole or in part, in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement; or

(6) as to any Collateral that becomes an Excluded Asset.

**_No Impairment of the Security Interests_**

Neither the Company nor any of the Guarantors will be permitted to take any action, or knowingly or negligently
omit to take any action, which action or omission would have the result of materially impairing the security interest
with respect to the Collateral for the benefit of the Trustee and the holders of the Notes.

48


-----

The Indenture will provide that any release of Collateral in accordance with the provisions thereof and the
applicable Security Documents will not be deemed to impair the security thereunder.

**Optional Redemption**

At any time and from time to time prior to, 2023, the Company may redeem some or all of the Notes at a
redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed plus the Applicable Premium,
plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.

At any time on or after, 2023, the Company may redeem some or all of the Notes at the redemption prices
(expressed in percentage of principal amount) set forth below, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but
excluding, the redemption date, if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on of each of the
years indicated below:

**Year** **Price**
2023 ....................................................................................................................................................... %
2024 ....................................................................................................................................................... %
2025 and thereafter ................................................................................................................................ 100.000%

In addition, at any time prior to, 2023, the Company may redeem up to 40% of the original principal
amount of the outstanding Notes (including Additional Notes, if any) with the net cash proceeds of one or more Equity
Offerings at a redemption price (expressed as a percentage of principal amount) of %, plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date; provided that (i) at least 55% of the aggregate principal amount
of Notes originally issued on the date of the Indenture remains outstanding after each such redemption, and (ii) notice
of any such redemption is delivered to the Trustee within 90 days of the closing of each such Equity Offering.

Notwithstanding anything in “—Optional Redemption” to the contrary, installments of interest on the Notes that
are due and payable on interest payment dates falling on or prior to a redemption date will be payable on the interest
payment date to the registered holders as of the close of business on the relevant record date according to the Notes
and the Indenture.

**_Notice of Redemption_**

The Company will prepare and give, or cause to be given, a notice of redemption to each holder of Notes of a
series to be redeemed at least 10 and not more than 60 calendar days prior to the date fixed for redemption, except that
notices of redemption may be given more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection
with a defeasance of the Notes of a series or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture. On and after a redemption
date, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes called for redemption unless the Company defaults in the payment of
the redemption price and accrued interest. At or before 11:00 a.m., London time, on the redemption date, the Company
will deposit with the paying agent (or the Trustee) money sufficient to pay the redemption price of and accrued interest
on the Notes to be redeemed on the redemption date. If fewer than all of the Notes of a series are to be redeemed, the
Notes of such series to be redeemed shall be selected by the registrar pro rata or by lot or by a method the registrar
deems to be fair and appropriate and, in respect of global Notes, subject to the applicable procedures of Euroclear and
Clearstream, as applicable.

Any redemption or notice of redemption may, in the Company’s discretion, be subject to one or more conditions
precedent. If any such redemption or notice is subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice
shall state that, in the Company’s discretion, the redemption date may be delayed until such time as any or all such
conditions shall be satisfied (or waived by the Company in its sole discretion), or such redemption may not occur and
such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied (or waived) by
the redemption date, or by the redemption date so delayed and such redemption provisions may be adjusted to comply
with the requirements of the depositary.

**Additional Amounts**

All payments of principal and interest in respect of the Notes by the Company or the paying agent on its behalf
will be made free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for or on account of, any present or future taxes,
duties, assessments or other similar governmental charges imposed or levied by the United States or any political

49


-----

subdivision or taxing authority of or in the United States (collectively, “U.S. Taxes”), unless such withholding or
deduction is required by law.

In the event such withholding or deduction for U.S. Taxes is required by law, subject to the limitations described
below, the Company will pay to or on account of any Non-U.S. Holder (as defined in “U.S. Federal Income Tax
Considerations” in this offering memorandum) or any non-U.S. entity that is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal
income tax purposes such additional amounts (“Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary to ensure that the net
amount received by the beneficial owner of a Note, after withholding or deduction for such U.S. Taxes, will be equal
to the amount such person would have received in the absence of such withholding or deduction.

However, no Additional Amounts shall be payable with respect to any U.S. Taxes if such U.S. Taxes are imposed
or levied for reasons unrelated to the holder’s or beneficial owner’s ownership or disposition of Notes, nor shall
Additional Amounts be payable for or on account of:

(1) any U.S. Taxes which would not have been so imposed, withheld or deducted but for:

(i) the existence of any present or former connection between the holder or beneficial owner (or between a

fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder or other equity owner of, or a person having a power
over, such holder or beneficial owner, if such holder or beneficial owner is an estate, a trust, a limited liability
company, a partnership, a corporation or other entity) and the United States, including, without limitation,
such holder or beneficial owner (or such fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member, shareholder or other equity
owner or person having such a power) being or having been a citizen or resident or treated as a resident of
the United States, being or having been engaged in a trade or business in the United States, being or having
been present in the United States, or having or having had a permanent establishment in the United States;

(ii) the failure of the holder or any other person to comply with certification, identification or information

reporting requirements concerning the nationality, residence, identity or connection with the United States of
the holder or beneficial owner of the Notes, if compliance is required by statute, by regulation of the United
States or any taxing authority therein or by an applicable income tax treaty to which the United States is a
party as a precondition to partial or complete exemption from such tax, assessment or other governmental
charge (including, but not limited to, the requirement to provide Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN,
Form W-8BEN-E, Form W-8ECI, Form W-8IMY (and related documentation) or any subsequent versions
thereof or successor thereto); or

(iii) the holder’s or beneficial owner’s present or former status as a personal holding company with respect to the

United States, as a controlled foreign corporation with respect to the United States, as a passive foreign
investment company with respect to the United States, as a foreign tax exempt organization with respect to
the United States or as a corporation that accumulates earnings to avoid United States federal income tax;

(2) any U.S. Taxes which would not have been imposed, withheld or deducted but for the failure of the holder

or beneficial owner to meet the requirements (including the certification requirements) of Section 871(h) or
Section 881(c) of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”);

(3) any U.S. Taxes which would not have been imposed, withheld or deducted but for the presentation by the

holder or beneficial owner of such Note for payment on a date more than 30 days after the date on which
such payment became due and payable or the date on which payment of the Note is duly provided for and
notice is given to holders, whichever occurs later, except to the extent that the holder or beneficial owner
would have been entitled to such Additional Amounts on presenting such Note on any date during such 30day period;

(4) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, excise, transfer, personal property, wealth or similar U.S. Taxes;

(5) any U.S. Taxes which are payable otherwise than by withholding or deduction from a payment on such Note;

(6) any U.S. Taxes which are imposed, withheld or deducted with respect to, or payable by, a holder that is not

the beneficial owner of the Note, or a portion of the Note, or that is a fiduciary, partnership, limited liability
company or other similar entity, but only to the extent that a beneficial owner, a beneficiary or settlor with
respect to such fiduciary or member of such partnership, limited liability company or similar entity would

50


-----

not have been entitled to the payment of an Additional Amount had such beneficial owner, settlor, beneficiary
or member received directly its beneficial or distributive share of the payment;

(7) any U.S. Taxes required to be withheld or deducted by any paying agent from any payment on any Note, if

such payment can be made without such withholding or deduction by at least one other paying agent;

(8) any U.S. Taxes required to be withheld or deducted where such withholding or deduction is imposed pursuant

to European Union Council Directive 2003/48/EC on the taxation of savings income, or any law
implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, such European Union Council
Directive;

(9) any U.S. Taxes imposed, withheld or deducted under Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (or any

amended or successor provisions), any current or future regulations or official interpretations thereof, any
agreement entered into pursuant to Section 1471(b) of the Code or any fiscal or regulatory legislation, rules
or practices adopted pursuant to any intergovernmental agreement entered into in connection with the
implementation of such sections of the Code;

(10) any U.S. Taxes that would not have been imposed, withheld or deducted but for a change in any law, treaty,

regulation, or administrative or judicial interpretation that becomes effective more than 15 days after the
applicable payment becomes due or is duly provided for, whichever occurs later; or

(11) any combination of items (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h), (i) and (j).

For purposes of this section, the acquisition, ownership, enforcement, or holding of or the receipt of any payment
with respect to the Notes will not constitute a connection (1) between the holder or beneficial owner and the United
States or (2) between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder or other equity owner of, or a person
having a power over, such holder or beneficial owner if such holder or beneficial owner is an estate, a trust, a limited
liability company, a partnership, a corporation or other entity and the United States.

Except as specifically provided under this section “Additional Amounts,” the Company will not be required to
make any payment with respect to any tax, duty, assessment or other governmental charge imposed by any government
or any political subdivision or taxing authority.

If the Company is required to pay Additional Amounts with respect to the Notes, the Company will notify the
Trustee and the paying agent pursuant to an Officer’s Certificate that specifies the Additional Amounts payable with
respect to the Notes and when the Additional Amounts are payable. If the Trustee and the paying agent do not receive
such an Officer’s Certificate from the Company, the Trustee and the paying agent may rely conclusively on the absence
of such an Officer’s Certificate in assuming that no such Additional Amounts are payable.

In addition, the Company will undertake that, to the extent permitted by law, it will maintain a paying agent that
will not require withholding or deduction of tax pursuant to European Union Council Directive 2003/48/EC on the
taxation of savings income or any law implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, such
European Union Council Directive.

Wherever in the Indenture, the Notes or this “Description of Notes” there is mentioned, in any context, with
respect to the Notes:

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) purchase prices in connection with a purchase of Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any Note Guarantee,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context,
Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

51


-----

**Redemption for Tax Reasons**

The Company may, at its option, redeem the Notes, in whole but not in part, at a redemption price equal to 100%
of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, together with any accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but
excluding, the redemption date, at any time, if the Company has or, based upon a written opinion of independent tax
counsel of nationally recognized standing selected by the Company, will become obliged to pay Additional Amounts
with respect to the Notes as a result of any change in, or amendment to, the laws, regulations, treaties, or rulings of
the United States or any political subdivision of or in the United States or any taxing authority thereof or therein
affecting taxation, or any change in, or amendment to, the application, official interpretation, administration or
enforcement of such laws, regulations, treaties or rulings (including a holding by a court of competent jurisdiction in
the United States), which change or amendment is enacted, adopted, announced or becomes effective on or after the
date of this offering memorandum, and the Company cannot avoid such payment obligation by taking commercially
reasonable measures available to it.

Notice of any redemption will be given pursuant to the procedures described under “—Optional Redemption—
Notice of Redemption”; provided, that the notice of redemption shall not be given earlier than 90 days before the
earliest date on which the Company would be obligated to pay such Additional Amounts on the Notes if a payment
was then due.

Notice of any redemption described above or notice thereof may, at the Company’s discretion, be subject to one
or more conditions precedent as provided under “—Optional Redemption—Notice of Redemption.”

**No Mandatory Redemption; Offer to Repurchase; Open Market Purchases**

The Company is not required to make any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the
Notes. However, under certain circumstances, the Company may be required to offer to repurchase Notes as described
under the caption “—Repurchase of Notes upon a Change of Control Triggering Event.” The Company may at any
time and from time to time purchase Notes in the open market, pursuant to negotiated transactions or otherwise, which
may include a consent solicitation.

**Repurchase of Notes Upon a Change of Control Triggering Event**

If a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs with respect to the Notes, unless the Company at such time has
given notice of redemption pursuant to the first or second paragraph under the caption “—Optional Redemption” or
terms described under “—Redemption for Tax Reasons,” as applicable, with respect to all outstanding Notes, the
Company will offer to repurchase all or any part (in minimum principal amount of €100,000 and integral multiples of
€1,000 in excess thereof) of each holder’s Notes pursuant to an offer to repurchase on the terms set forth in the
Indenture (a “Change of Control Offer”). In the Change of Control Offer, the Company will offer a payment in cash
equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes being repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest on
the Notes being repurchased, to, but excluding, the date of repurchase (the “Change of Control Payment”). Within 30
days following any Change of Control Triggering Event with respect to the Notes, unless the Company at such time
has given notice of redemption as described in the first sentence of this paragraph with respect to all outstanding Notes,
the Company will give a notice to each holder of such Notes, with a copy to the Trustee, describing the transaction or
transactions and ratings downgrade that constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to repurchase
the Notes on the date specified in the notice (the “Change of Control Payment Date”), which date will be no earlier
than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is given, pursuant to the procedures required by the
Indenture and described in such notice.

The Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities
laws and regulations thereunder, if any, to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the
repurchase of the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event. To the extent that the provisions of any
securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control Triggering Event provisions of the Indenture, the
Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its
obligations under the Change of Control Triggering Event provisions of the Indenture by virtue of such conflict.

At or prior to 11:00 a.m., London time, on the Change of Control Payment Date, the Company will, to the extent
lawful, deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or
portions of Notes properly tendered. On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Company will, to the extent lawful,

52


-----

(i) accept for payment all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Change of
Control Offer and (ii) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Notes properly accepted, together with an
Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions of Notes being repurchased by the
Company.

The paying agent will promptly deliver to each holder of Notes properly tendered the Change of Control Payment
for such Notes, and the Trustee will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book entry) to each
holder a new Note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any; _provided_
that each new Note will be in a minimum principal amount of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess
thereof. The Company will publicly announce the results of the Change of Control Offer on or as soon as practicable
after the Change of Control Payment Date.

The Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control Triggering Event
with respect to the Notes if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise
in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the
Company and repurchases all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under the Change of Control Offer or (ii) a
valid notice of redemption for all of the Notes has been given, or will be given contemporaneously with the Change
of Control Triggering Event, pursuant to the terms of the Indenture as described under “—Optional Redemption” or
“—Redemption for Tax Reasons” unless and until such notice has been validly revoked or there is a default in the
payment of the applicable redemption price. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control
Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event or conditional upon the occurrence of a
Change of Control Triggering Event, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control Triggering Event
at the time the Change of Control Offer is made.

In the event that holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes accept
a Change of Control Offer and the Company (or any third party making such Change of Control Offer in lieu of the
Company as described above) purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, the
Company or such third party will have the right, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not
more than 60 days following the repurchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer described above, to redeem all
of the Notes that remain outstanding following such repurchase at a redemption price equal to the Change of Control
Payment, plus to the extent not included in the Change of Control Payment, accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes
that remain outstanding to, but excluding, the date of repurchase. In determining whether the holders of not less than
90% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes accept a Change of Control Offer, Notes owned by
an Affiliate of the Company shall be deemed to be outstanding for the purposes of such Change of Control Offer.

The Credit Agreement provides that the occurrence of certain change of control events with respect to the
Company will constitute a default thereunder.

Other indebtedness that the Company or its Subsidiaries has incurred or may incur may contain prohibitions on
the occurrence of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or require the repurchase of such
indebtedness upon a Change of Control Triggering Event. Moreover, the exercise by the holders of their right to
require the Company to repurchase their Notes could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the Change of
Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Company. Finally, the Company’s ability
to pay cash to the holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be limited
by its then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when
necessary to make any required repurchases.

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control Triggering Event, the Indenture will contain no
provisions that permit the holders of the Notes to require that the Company repurchase or redeem the Notes in the
event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction.

The definition of Change of Control includes a phrase relating to the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer,
conveyance or other disposition of “all or substantially all” of the properties or assets of the Company and its
subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,”
there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of
Notes to require the Company to repurchase its Notes as a result of a sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other
disposition of less than all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole to another Person or
group may be uncertain.

53


-----

The Change of Control Triggering Event repurchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make it
more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of the Company and thus, the removal of incumbent management. The
Change of Control Triggering Event repurchase feature is a result of negotiations between the initial purchasers and
the Company. As of the Issue Date, the Company has no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a
Change of Control, although it is possible that it could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed
below, the Company could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other
recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event under the Indenture, but that could
increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect the Company’s capital structure or
credit ratings. Restrictions on the Company’s ability to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants
described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness.” Such restrictions in the Indenture
can be waived only with the consent of holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except
for limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that
may afford holders of the Notes protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction.

The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Company’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes
as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event with respect to such Notes may be waived or modified with the
written consent of a majority in principal amount of the Notes.

**Exchange and Transfer**

Holders generally will be able to exchange Notes for other Notes with the same total principal amount and the
same terms.

Holders may present Notes for exchange or for registration of transfer at the Corporate Trust Office or at the
office of any transfer agent designated for that purpose. The registrar or designated transfer agent will exchange or
transfer the Notes if it is satisfied with the documents of title and identity of the Person making the request; provided
that such transfer complies with the restrictions specified in the section of this offering memorandum titled “Transfer
Restrictions.” The Company will not charge a service charge for any exchange or registration of transfer of Notes.
However, the Company and the registrar may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other
governmental charge payable for the registration of transfer or exchange. The Company has initially appointed the
Trustee as registrar in respect of the Notes.

At any time the Company may (i) designate additional transfer agents; (ii) rescind the designation of any transfer
agent; or (iii) approve a change in the office of any transfer agent.

However, the Company is required to maintain a transfer agent in each place of payment for the Notes at all times.

If the Company elects to redeem the Notes or makes a Change of Control Offer with respect to the Notes, neither
the Company nor the Trustee will be required to:

  - issue, register the transfer of or exchange any Notes during the period beginning at the opening of business
15 calendar days before the day the Company gives the notice of redemption or makes the Change of Control
Offer and ending at the close of business on the day the notice is given or the Change of Control Offer is
made;

  - register the transfer or exchange of any Note so selected for redemption or subject to repurchase in such
Change of Control Offer, except for any portion not to be redeemed or subject to repurchase; or

  - in the case of a redemption or a Change of Control Payment Date occurring after a regular record date but on
or before the corresponding interest payment date, register the transfer or exchange of any Note on or after
the regular record date and before the date of redemption or repurchase.

**Payment and Paying Agents**

Under the Indenture, the Company will pay interest on the Notes to the Persons in whose names the Notes are
registered at the close of business on the regular record date for each interest payment. However, the Company will
pay the interest payable on the Notes at their stated maturity to the Persons to whom the Company pays the principal
amount of the Notes.

54


-----

The Company will pay principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes at the Corporate Trust Office or the
offices of the designated paying agents.

(i) All cash payments of principal or premium, if any, and interest with respect to the Notes represented by one
or more global notes registered in the name of or held by the common depositary of Euroclear and Clearstream or its
nominee will be made through the paying agent by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts
specified by the registered Holder or Holders thereof and (ii) all cash payments of principal or premium, if any, and
interest with respect to certificated Notes may, at the option of the Company, be made by wire transfer to a euro
account maintained by the payee with a bank in the United Kingdom or Europe if the applicable Holder elects payment
by wire transfer by giving written notice to the Trustee or the paying agent to such effect designating such account no
later than 30 days immediately preceding the relevant due date for payment (or such other date as the Trustee may
accept). Until otherwise designated by the Company, the Company’s office or agency will be the office of the paying
agent maintained for such purpose in London, United Kingdom.

The Company will initially designate Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch as paying agent for the Notes. The
Company may at any time appoint new paying agents, transfer agents and registrars. At any time, the Company may
designate additional paying agents or rescind the designation of any paying agents. However, the Company is required
to maintain a paying agent in each place of payment for the Notes at all times. In addition, as long as the Notes remain
outstanding, the Company has also agreed that it will, to the extent permitted as a matter of law, ensure that there is a
paying agent with respect to the Notes in a European Union Member State that is not obliged to withhold or deduct
tax pursuant to the European Union Council Directive 2003/48/EC (as amended) on the taxation of savings income in
the form of interest payments which was adopted by the ECOFIN Council on June 3, 2003, and amended by Council
Decision on July 19, 2004, or any law implementing or complying with, or introduced to conform to, such Directive.

Any money deposited with the Trustee or any paying agent for the payment of principal or premium, if any, and
interest on the Notes that remains unclaimed for the earlier of (i) two years after the date the payments became due
and (ii) such time as the money escheats to the state, may be repaid to the Company upon its request. After the
Company has been repaid, holders entitled to those payments may only look to the Company for payment as its secured
general creditors. Neither the Trustee nor any paying agent will be liable for those payments after the Company has
been repaid.

**Certain Covenants**

Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants that will be contained in the Indenture.

58


-----

As of the Issue Date, all of the Company’s Subsidiaries are Restricted Subsidiaries. The Company will not permit
any Restricted Subsidiary to become an Unrestricted Subsidiary except pursuant to “—Designation of Restricted and
Unrestricted Subsidiaries.” For purposes of designating any Restricted Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, all
outstanding Investments by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries (except to the extent repaid) in the Subsidiary
so designated will be deemed to be an Investment in an amount determined as set forth in the definition of
“Investment.” Such designation will be permitted only if an Investment in such amount would be permitted at such
time, whether as a Restricted Payment or a Permitted Investment, and if such Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition
of an Unrestricted Subsidiary. Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the covenants set forth in the
Indenture.

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) will be the fair market value on the date of the Restricted
Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be transferred or issued by the Company or such Restricted
Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to the Restricted Payment. The fair market value of any assets or securities
that are required to be valued by this covenant will be determined by the Board of Directors of the Company or senior
management thereof whose good faith determination will be conclusive.

**_Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create,
incur, issue, assume, guarantee or otherwise become directly or indirectly liable, contingently, or otherwise
(collectively, “incur” and collectively, an “incurrence”) with respect to any Indebtedness (including Acquired
Indebtedness) and the Company will not issue any shares of Disqualified Stock and will not permit any Restricted
Subsidiary to issue any shares of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock; provided, however, that the Company may
incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) or issue shares of Disqualified Stock, and any Restricted
Subsidiary may incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness), issue shares of Disqualified Stock and issue
shares of Preferred Stock, if the Total Net Leverage Ratio at the time such additional Indebtedness is incurred or such
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock is issued would have been no greater than 5.50 to 1.00, determined on a Pro
Forma Basis (including the application on a Pro Forma Basis of the net proceeds therefrom), as if the additional
Indebtedness had been incurred, or the Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock had been issued, as the case may be, and
the application of proceeds therefrom had occurred at the beginning of the most recently ended Measurement Period;
_provided further, however, that Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries may not incur Indebtedness or issue Disqualified Stock_
or Preferred Stock if, after giving Pro Forma Effect to such incurrence or issuance, the amount of Indebtedness or
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock of Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries outstanding pursuant to this paragraph (together
with any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof) and clause (31) below exceeds the greater of (x) $300.0 million
and (y) 18.0% of Adjusted EBITDA as of the last day of the most recently ended Measurement Period on or prior to
the date of determination.

The foregoing limitations will not apply to:

(1) Indebtedness under the Credit Facilities (including the Notes issued on the Issue Date) by the Company or

any of its Restricted Subsidiaries and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances
thereunder (with letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances being deemed to have a principal amount equal to
the face amount thereof); provided, however, that immediately after giving effect to any such incurrence, the
then outstanding aggregate principal amount of all Indebtedness under this clause (1) does not exceed at any
one time the sum of (i) $5,350 million and (ii) (x) $1,750 million (the “Fixed Incremental Amount”), plus
(y)(A) additional amounts of First Lien Indebtedness if, after giving effect to the incurrence thereof (but
excluding the cash proceeds thereof for the purposes of calculating such ratio) the Company is in compliance,
on a Pro Forma Basis, with a Consolidated Senior Secured First Lien Debt Ratio of not more than 3.00:1.00
and (B) additional amounts of Secured Indebtedness (other than First Lien Indebtedness) if, after giving effect
to the incurrence thereof but excluding the cash proceeds thereof for the purposes of calculating such ratio,
the Company is in compliance, on a Pro Forma Basis, with a Secured Net Leverage Ratio of not more than
4.75:1.00 (such amounts under subclauses (A) and (B), the “Ratio Incremental Amount” and, together with
the Fixed Incremental Amount, the “Incremental Amount”) as of the end of the most recent Measurement
Period; provided that for purposes of clause (y), if the proceeds will be applied to finance a Limited Condition
Transaction, the Ratio Incremental Amount will be determined in accordance with the provisions described
under “Certain Calculations” herein; _provided,_ _further, that if the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary_
incurs Indebtedness using the Fixed Incremental Amount on the same date that it incurs Indebtedness using

59


-----

the Ratio Incremental Amount, the Consolidated Senior Secured First Lien Debt Ratio will be calculated
without regard to any incurrence of Indebtedness under the Fixed Incremental Amount;

(2) [reserved];

(3) Indebtedness of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries existing, or any Preferred Stock of the

Company or any Preferred Stock of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries issued, on the Issue
Date (other than Indebtedness described in clauses (1) and (25));

(4) Indebtedness among the Company and its Subsidiaries (including between or among Subsidiaries); provided

within 30 days of the incurrence of such Indebtedness;

(5) Guarantees by the Company of Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary and by any Restricted Subsidiary

of Indebtedness of the Company or any other Restricted Subsidiary; _provided_ that (i) Guarantees by the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness of any Unrestricted Subsidiary shall be subject to
compliance with the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” (other than clause (e)
of the definition of “Permitted Investments”); (ii) Guarantees permitted under this clause (5) shall be
subordinated to the Obligations under the Indenture of the applicable Restricted Subsidiary to the same extent
and on terms not materially less favorable to the Holders as the Indebtedness so Guaranteed is subordinated
to the Obligations under the Indenture; and (iii) no Indebtedness incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of
this “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness” or clauses (1), (2) or (31) of this paragraph, or any
Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof shall be Guaranteed by any Restricted Subsidiary

acquisition or lease or the completion of such construction, replacement, repair or improvement and (B) the
aggregate amount of Indebtedness permitted pursuant to this clause (6)(i) of this “—Limitation on Incurrence
of Indebtedness” shall not exceed the greater of $100,000,000 and 13.0% of Adjusted EBITDA (determined
at the time of incurrence of such Indebtedness (calculated on a Pro Forma Basis) as of the last day of the
most recently ended Measurement Period on or prior to the date of determination) at any time outstanding,
and (ii) any Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof;

(7) Indebtedness arising in connection with (a) Hedging Obligations entered into to hedge or mitigate risks to

which the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary has actual or potential exposure (other than those in respect

convertible indebtedness, including to hedge or mitigate foreign currency and commodity price risks, (b)
Hedging Obligations entered into in order to effectively cap, collar or exchange interest rates (from fixed to
floating rates, from one floating rate to another floating rate or otherwise) with respect to any interest-bearing
liability or Investment of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary and (c) any accelerated share repurchase
contract, prepaid forward purchase contract or similar contract with respect to the purchase by the Company
of its Equity Interest, which purchase is permitted by the covenant described under “— Limitation on
Restricted Payments”; provided that Guarantees by the Company or any Guarantor of such Indebtedness of
any Unrestricted Subsidiary shall be subject to compliance with the covenant described under “—Limitation
on Restricted Payments.”

(8) (i) Indebtedness of any Person that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary after the date hereof (including any

Indebtedness assumed in connection with the acquisition of a Restricted Subsidiary); provided that (A) such
Indebtedness exists at the time such Person becomes a Restricted Subsidiary and is not created in
contemplation of or in connection with such Person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary and (B) the Company,
on a Pro Forma Basis, could incur $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the Total Net Leverage Ratio

(32) Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of Indebtedness incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of

used for the purpose of section 2:403 Dutch Civil Code (and any residual liability under such declaration
arising pursuant to section 2:404(2) Dutch Civil Code and Indebtedness arising as a result of a fiscal unity
(fiscale eenheid) of two entities for Dutch tax purposes).

The Company will be entitled to divide and classify an item of Indebtedness in more than one of the types of
Indebtedness described in the first paragraph and clauses (1) through (35) of the second paragraph above.

The accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the payment of interest in the form of additional
Indebtedness, the payment of dividends on Disqualified Stock in the form of additional shares of Disqualified Stock,
accretion or amortization of original issue discount or liquidation preferences and increases in the amount of
Indebtedness outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate or currencies will not be deemed to be
an incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of this covenant. The principal amount of any non-interest bearing
Indebtedness or other discount security constituting Indebtedness at any date shall be the principal amount thereof that
would be shown on a consolidated balance sheet of the Company dated such date prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Notwithstanding the above, if any Indebtedness is incurred as Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness originally
incurred pursuant to this covenant, and such Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness would cause any applicable Dollardenominated or Adjusted EBITDA restriction described under this “Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness” to be
exceeded if calculated on the date of such Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness, such Dollar-denominated or Adjusted
EBITDA restriction, as applicable, shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such
Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness is permitted to be incurred pursuant to the definition of “Permitted Refinancing
Indebtedness.”

If Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock originally incurred in reliance upon a percentage of
Adjusted EBITDA under this covenant is being refinanced and such refinancing would cause the maximum amount
of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock thereunder to be exceeded at such time, then such refinancing
will nevertheless be permitted thereunder and such additional Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock will
be deemed to have been incurred under the applicable provision so long as the principal amount or liquidation
preference of such refinancing Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock does not exceed the principal
amount or liquidation preference of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock being refinanced, plus
additional Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock incurred to pay accrued but unpaid interest or
dividends, premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance costs, underwriting or initial purchaser discounts, fees,
costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) in connection with such refinancing.

The principal amount or liquidation preference of any Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock
incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, if incurred in a different currency
from the Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the
currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such respective Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.

The Indenture will not treat (1) unsecured Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to Secured Indebtedness merely
because it is unsecured or (2) Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to any other Indebtedness merely because it has

63


-----

a junior priority with respect to the same collateral or because it is secured by different collateral or issued or
guaranteed by other obligors.

**_Limitation on Liens_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any Guarantors, to enter into, create, incur or assume any Lien (except
Permitted Liens) (the “Initial Lien”) on any property owned by any of them, whether now owned or hereafter acquired,
in order to secure any Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness among the Company and the Guarantors), except, in the
case of any property that does not constitute Collateral, for any Initial Lien securing any Indebtedness if the Notes are
secured equally and ratably with (or prior to) the obligations so secured for so long as such obligations are so secured.

Any Lien created for the benefit of the holders of the Notes pursuant to the preceding sentence shall provide by
its terms that such Lien shall be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon the release and
discharge of the Initial Lien.

For purposes of the foregoing covenant, (A) a Lien securing an item of Indebtedness need not be permitted solely
by reference to one category of permitted Liens (or any portion thereof) described in the definition of “Permitted
Liens” but may be permitted in part under any combination thereof and (B) in the event that a Lien meets the criteria
of more than one of the types of Permitted Liens, the Company, in its sole discretion, will classify, and may reclassify,
such Lien and only be required to include the amount and type of such Lien as a Permitted Lien, and a Lien may be
divided and classified and reclassified into more than one of such types of Liens. In addition, (1) for purposes of
calculating compliance with the foregoing covenant, in no event will the amount of any Indebtedness or Liens securing
any Indebtedness be required to be included more than once despite the fact more than one Person is or becomes liable
with respect to such Indebtedness and despite the fact such Indebtedness is secured by the property of more than one
Person (for example, and for avoidance of doubt, in the case where there are Liens on the property of one or more of
the Company and its Subsidiaries securing any Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness secured shall only be
included once for purposes of such calculations) and (2) the expansion of Liens by virtue of accrual of interest, the
accretion of accreted value, the payment of interest or dividends in the form of additional Indebtedness, amortization
of original issue discount and increases in the amount of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in
the exchange rate of currencies will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Liens for purposes of this covenant.

**_Asset Sales_**

The Indenture will provide that the Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to,
consummate an Asset Sale, unless:

(1) the Company or any such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration (including, but

not limited to, by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities,
contingent or otherwise, in connection with, such Asset Sale) at the time of such Asset Sale at least equal to
the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Company at the time of contractually agreeing to
such Asset Sale) of the assets sold or otherwise disposed of; and

(2) except in the case of an Asset Swap, in the Company’s good faith determination, at least 75% of the

consideration therefor, together with all other Asset Sales since the Issue Date (on a cumulative basis),
received by the Company or any such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form of cash or
Cash Equivalents; provided that the amount of:

(A) any liabilities (as shown on the Company’s most recent consolidated balance sheet or in the footnotes

thereto, or if incurred or accrued subsequent to the date of such balance sheet, such liabilities that would
have been reflected on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet or in the footnotes thereto if such
incurrence or accrual had taken place on or prior to the date of such balance sheet, as determined in good
faith by the Company) of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary (other than contingent obligations
and liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the Notes or any Note Guarantee) that are assumed
by the transferee of any such assets (or are otherwise extinguished by the transferee in connection with
the transactions relating to such Asset Sale) or are acquired and extinguished by the Company or such
Restricted Subsidiary and, in each case, for which the Company and all such Restricted Subsidiaries
shall have no further obligation with respect thereto,

64


-----

(B) any notes or other obligations or securities received by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from

such transferee that are converted by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary or reasonably expected
by the Company acting in good faith to be converted by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary into
cash or Cash Equivalents, or by their terms are required to be satisfied for cash or Cash Equivalents (to
the extent of the cash or Cash Equivalents received), in each case, within 180 days following the closing
of such Asset Sale,

(C) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary in such

Asset Sale having an aggregate fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Company), taken
together with all other Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this clause (c) that is at
that time outstanding (but, to the extent that any such Designated Non-Cash Consideration is sold or
otherwise liquidated for cash, minus the lesser of (a) the amount of the cash received (less the cost of
disposition, if any) and (b) the initial amount of such Designated Non-Cash Consideration) not to exceed
the greater of (x) $200,000,000 and (y) 12.5% of Adjusted EBITDA (as determined at the time any such
Asset Sale is made (calculated on a Pro Forma Basis)) as of the last day of the most recently ended
Measurement Period on or prior to the date of determination, with the fair market value (as determined
in good faith by the Company) of each item of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at
the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value, and

(D) any Capital Stock or assets described in clauses (2)(a) and (2)(d) of the next paragraph of this covenant,

shall be deemed to be cash for purposes of this provision and for no other purpose.

Within 450 days after the receipt of any Net Proceeds of any Asset Sale, the Company or such Restricted
Subsidiary, at its option, may apply an amount equal to the Net Proceeds from such Asset Sale (or, if the Company’s
Secured Net Leverage Ratio is lower than or equal to 2.50:1.00 on a Pro Forma Basis, 50% of such Net Proceeds),

(1) to permanently reduce:

(A) Obligations under the Notes or any other Pari Passu Indebtedness (including obligations under the Credit

Facilities and the Existing Secured Notes) of the Company or a Guarantor (and to correspondingly reduce
commitments with respect thereto, if applicable); provided that if such Net Proceeds are applied to other
Pari Passu Indebtedness then the Company shall (i) equally and ratably reduce Obligations under the
Notes (x) as provided under “Optional Redemption” or (y) through open market purchases or (ii) make
an offer (in accordance with the procedures set forth below for an Asset Sale Offer (as defined below))
to all Holders of Notes to purchase their Notes at 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus the amount
of accrued but unpaid interest, if any, on the principal amount of Notes that would otherwise be redeemed
under clause (i), or

(B) Indebtedness of a Non-Guarantor Subsidiary, other than Indebtedness owed to the Company or another

Restricted Subsidiary; or

(2) to (a) make an Investment in any one or more businesses; provided that such Investment in any business is

in the form of the acquisition of Capital Stock and results in the Company or another of its Restricted
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, owning an amount of the Capital Stock of such business, such that it
constitutes a Restricted Subsidiary, (b) acquire properties (other than Capital Stock) or (c) make capital
expenditures that, in the case of each of (a), (b) and (c) are either (x) used or useful in a Related Business or
(y) replace, repair, improve or maintain assets to be used or useful in a Related Business (provided that such
assets or Capital Stock shall become Collateral (unless such assets or Capital Stock are Excluded Assets or
otherwise are not pledged to secure any other First-Priority Obligations) under the Security Documents and
in accordance with the Indenture substantially simultaneously with such Investment or acquisition to the
extent the assets disposed of constituted Collateral); or

(3) any combination of the foregoing;

_provided that, in the case of clause (2) above, a binding commitment shall be treated as a permitted application of the_
Net Proceeds from the date of such commitment so long as the Company or such other Restricted Subsidiary enters
into such commitment with the good faith expectation that such Net Proceeds will be applied to satisfy such

65


-----

commitment within 180 days of such commitment (an “Acceptable Commitment”); and provided further that if any
Acceptable Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before such Net Proceeds are applied, the
Company or such Restricted Subsidiary enters into another Acceptable Commitment (a “Second Commitment”) within
180 days of such cancellation or termination; provided further that if any Second Commitment is later cancelled or
terminated for any reason before such Net Proceeds are applied, then such Net Proceeds shall constitute Excess
Proceeds.

Any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale that are not invested or applied as provided and within the time period set
forth in the preceding paragraph will be deemed to constitute “Excess Proceeds.” When the aggregate amount of
Excess Proceeds exceeds $50.0 million, the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary shall make an offer to all Holders
of the Notes and, if required by the terms of any Pari Passu Indebtedness, to the holders of such Pari Passu Indebtedness
(an “Asset Sale Offer”) to purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount of Notes in minimum denominations of
€1,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof and such Pari Passu Indebtedness that may be purchased out
of the Excess Proceeds at an offer price in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus
accrued and unpaid interest, if any (or, in respect of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, such lesser price, if any, as may be
provided for or permitted by the terms of such Pari Passu Indebtedness), to the date fixed for the closing of such offer,
in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture.

The Company will commence an Asset Sale Offer with respect to Excess Proceeds within fifteen Business Days
after the date that Excess Proceeds exceed $50.0 million by electronically delivering or mailing the notice required
pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, with a copy to the Trustee. The Company may satisfy the foregoing obligations
with respect to any Excess Proceeds by making an Asset Sale Offer with respect to such Excess Proceeds prior to the
time period that may be required by the Indenture with respect to all or a part of the available Excess Proceeds (the
“Advance Portion”) in advance of being required to do so by the Indenture (an “Advance Offer”).

To the extent that the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of Notes and such Pari Passu
Indebtedness tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds (or in the case of an Advance
Offer, the Advance Portion), the Company may use any remaining Excess Proceeds (or in the case of an Advance
Offer, the Advance Portion) (the “Declined Amounts”) for any purpose, subject to the paragraph below and the other
covenants contained in the Indenture. If the aggregate amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of Notes and the Pari
Passu Indebtedness surrendered in an Asset Sale Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds (or in the case of an
Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Trustee shall select the Notes and the Company or the agent for such Pari
Passu Indebtedness shall select such Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased (a) if the Notes or such Pari Passu
Indebtedness are listed on any national securities exchange, in compliance with the requirements of the principal
national securities exchange on which the Notes or such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, are listed, (b) on a pro
rata basis based on the amount (determined as set forth above) of the Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered
or (c) by lot or such similar method in accordance with the procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, as
applicable; provided that no Notes of €100,000 or less shall be repurchased in part. Upon completion of any such
Asset Sale Offer (or Advance Offer), the amount of Excess Proceeds (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance
Portion) shall be reset at zero.

An Asset Sale Offer or Advance Offer may be made at the same time as consents are solicited with respect to an
amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture, Notes and/or Note Guarantees (but the Asset Sale Offer or
Advance Offer may not condition tenders on the delivery of such consents).

Pending the final application of any Net Proceeds pursuant to this covenant, the holder of such Net Proceeds may
apply such Net Proceeds temporarily to reduce Indebtedness outstanding under a revolving credit facility or otherwise
use such Net Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture.

The Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities
laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase
of the Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations
conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and
regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof.

**_Transactions with Affiliates_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, sell, lease or otherwise transfer
any property or assets to, or purchase, lease or otherwise acquire any property or assets from, or otherwise engage in
any other transactions with, any of its Affiliates involving aggregate payments, for any such transaction or series of
related transactions (each of the foregoing, an “Affiliate Transaction”), in excess of $15,000,000, unless:

(1) such Affiliate Transactions are at prices and on terms and conditions, taken as a whole, not materially less

favorable to the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary than could be obtained on an arm’s-length basis
from unrelated third parties or, if in the good faith judgment of the Company no comparable transaction is
available with which to compare such transactions, such Affiliate Transactions are otherwise fair to the
Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view as determined by the Company in
good faith; or

(2) with respect to such Affiliate Transactions, the Company has obtained a letter from an independent financial

advisor stating that such transactions are fair from a financial point of view.

The foregoing provisions will not apply to the following:

(A) transactions between or among the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries not involving any other

Affiliate;

plans or similar employee benefits plans) between the Company and any Restricted Subsidiary and their
directors, officers, employees, members of management and consultants in the ordinary course of
business;

(H) the existence of, and the performance of obligations of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries

under the terms of any agreement in existence or contemplated as of the Issue Date, as these agreements
may be amended, restated, amended and restated, supplemented, extended, renewed or otherwise
modified from time to time; _provided, however, that any future amendment, restatement, amendment_
and restatement, supplement, extension, renewal or other modification entered into after the Issue Date
will be permitted to the extent that its terms are not more disadvantageous in any material respect, taken
as a whole, to the Holders than the terms of the agreements on the Issue Date;

(I) any agreement between any Person and an Affiliate of such Person existing at the time such Person is

acquired by or merged into the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries pursuant to the terms of the
Indenture; provided that such agreement was not entered into in contemplation of such acquisition or
merger, or any amendment thereto (so long as any such amendment is not disadvantageous to the Holders
in any material respect in the good faith judgment of the Company when taken as a whole as compared
to such agreement as in effect on the date of such acquisition or merger);

67


-----

(J) payments to or from, and transactions with, joint ventures (to the extent any such joint venture is only

an Affiliate as a result of Investments by the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries in such joint
venture), non-Wholly Owned Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of
business to the extent otherwise permitted under the definition of “Permitted Investments”;

(K) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers or purchasers or sellers of goods or services, or

transactions otherwise relating to the purchase or sale of goods or services, in each case in the ordinary
course of business and otherwise in compliance with the terms of the Indenture, which are fair to the
Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, in the reasonable determination of the board of directors of the
Company, or are on terms at least as favorable, in all material respects, as might reasonably have been
obtained at such time from an unaffiliated party;

(L) the entering into of any Tax sharing agreement or arrangement to the extent payments under such

agreement or arrangement would otherwise be permitted under the covenant described under “—
Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

(M) any contribution to the capital of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries;

(N) the formation and maintenance of any consolidated group or subgroup for Tax, accounting or cash

pooling or management purposes in the ordinary course of business;

Company or any Restricted Subsidiary contemplated in the foregoing subclause (i) or that were acquired
from Persons other than the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, in each case, in accordance with the
terms of such securities.

If the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (i) purchases or otherwise acquires assets or properties from
a Person which is not an Affiliate, the purchase or acquisition by an Affiliate of the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary of an interest in all or a portion of the assets or properties acquired shall not be deemed an Affiliate
Transaction (or cause such purchase or acquisition by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary to be deemed an
Affiliate Transaction) or (ii) sells or otherwise disposes of assets or other properties to a Person who is not an Affiliate,
the sale or other disposition by an Affiliate of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of an interest in all or a
portion of the assets or properties sold shall not be deemed an Affiliate Transaction (or cause such sale or other

surviving entity); or (2) sell, assign, transfer, convey, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the
properties or assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in one or more related
transactions, to another Person, unless:

or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than the Company) or to which such sale, assignment,
transfer, conveyance, lease or other disposition has been made is an entity organized or existing under the
laws of any state of the United States or the District of Columbia (the Company or such Person, including
the Person to which such sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance, lease or other disposition has been made, as
the case may be, being herein called the “Successor Company”); _provided_ that at any time the Successor

68

Company is not a corporation, there shall be a co-issuer of the Notes that is a corporation that satisfies the
requirements of this covenant;

(3) immediately after such transaction, no Default or Event of Default exists;

(4) (a) the Company (or its Successor Company, as applicable), on a Pro Forma Basis, would be permitted to

incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the Total Net Leverage Ratio test set forth in the
first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness,” or (b) the
Total Net Leverage Ratio for the Company (or the Successor Company, as applicable) and its Restricted
Subsidiaries would be less than or equal to such ratio for the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries
immediately prior to such transaction; and

(5) in any transaction in which the Company is not the Successor Company, the Company or the Successor

Company delivers to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel each stating that such
transaction complies with the “—Consolidation, Merger and Conveyance, Transfer and Lease of Assets”
section of the Indenture and, if applicable, all conditions precedent in the Indenture to the execution of the
supplemental indenture have been satisfied, and, with respect to the Opinion of Counsel, that such
supplemental indenture is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Successor Company.

The Indenture will also provide for similar provisions relating to any consolidation, merger or sale, assignment,
transfer, conveyance, lease or other disposition of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of a Guarantor;
_provided that such provisions shall not apply to a transaction pursuant to which such Guarantor shall be released from_
its obligations under the Indenture, the Security Documents and the Notes in accordance with the covenant described
under “—Guarantees.”

For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or
substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Restricted Subsidiaries of the Company, which properties
and assets, if held by the Company instead of such Restricted Subsidiaries, would constitute all or substantially all of
the properties and assets of the Company on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed to be the sale, lease, conveyance,
assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Company.

The predecessor company will be released from its obligations under the Indenture and, upon the execution and
delivery of the supplemental indenture referred to above, the Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted
for, and may exercise every right and power of, the Company under the Indenture and the Security Documents, but,
in the case of a lease of all or substantially all its assets, the predecessor will not be so released.

Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise
established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree
of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve “all or substantially all” of the property or assets
of a Person.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, clauses (3) and (4) above will not apply to (a) a sale, assignment, transfer,
conveyance, lease or other disposition of assets between or among the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, (b)
any Restricted Subsidiary consolidating with, merging into or selling, assigning, transferring, conveying, leasing or
otherwise disposing of all or part of its properties and assets to the Company or to another Restricted Subsidiary
(provided that, in the event that such Restricted Subsidiary is a Guarantor, it may consolidate with, merge into or sell,
assign, transfer, convey, lease or otherwise dispose of all or part of its properties and assets solely to the Company or
another Guarantor) or (c) the Company or a Guarantor merging with an Affiliate solely for the purpose and with the
sole effect of reorganizing the Company or such Guarantor in another jurisdiction.

**_Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries_**

The Board of Directors of the Company may designate any Restricted Subsidiary of the Company to be an
Unrestricted Subsidiary; provided that:

69


-----

(1) any Guarantee by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary thereof of any Indebtedness of the Subsidiary

being so designated will be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness by the Company or such Restricted
Subsidiary (or both, if applicable) at the time of such designation, and such incurrence of Indebtedness would
be permitted under the covenant described above under the caption “—Limitation on Incurrence of
Indebtedness”;

(2) the aggregate value (as determined in accordance with the Indenture) of all outstanding Investments owned

by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary being so designated (including any
Guarantee by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary thereof of any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary) will
be deemed to be an Investment made as of the time of such designation and that such Investment would be
permitted under the covenant described above under the caption “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

(3) the Subsidiary being so designated has not Guaranteed or otherwise directly or indirectly provided credit

support for any Indebtedness of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, except (i) to the extent
such Guarantee or credit support would be released upon such designation or (ii) a pledge of the Equity
Interests of the Unrestricted Subsidiary that is the obligor thereunder; and

(4) no Default or Event of Default would be in existence following such designation.

Any designation of a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be evidenced to
the Trustee by delivering to the Trustee the Board Resolution giving effect to such designation and an Officer’s
Certificate certifying that such designation complied with the preceding conditions and was permitted by the
Indenture. If, at any time, any Unrestricted Subsidiary would fail to meet any of the preceding requirements described
in clause (3) above, it will thereafter cease to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary for purposes of the Indenture and any
Indebtedness, Investments, or Liens on the property, of such Subsidiary will be deemed to be incurred or made by a
Restricted Subsidiary of the Company as of such date and, if such Indebtedness, Investments or Liens are not permitted
to be incurred or made as of such date under the Indenture, the Company will be in default under the Indenture.

The Board of Directors of the Company may at any time designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted
Subsidiary; provided that:

(1) such designation will be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary of the

Company of any outstanding Indebtedness (including any Obligations that are non-recourse) of such
Unrestricted Subsidiary and such designation will only be permitted if such Indebtedness is permitted under
the covenant described under the caption “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness”; and

(2) no Default or Event of Default would be in existence following such designation.

**_Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create
or otherwise cause or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of any
such Non-Guarantor Subsidiary to:

(1) (a) pay dividends or make any other distributions to the Company or any Guarantors on its Capital Stock or

with respect to any other interest or participation in, or measured by, its profits, or pay any Indebtedness
owed to the Company or any Guarantor;

(2) make loans or advances to the Company or any Guarantor; or

(3) sell, lease or transfer any of its properties or assets to the Company or any Guarantor,

except (in each case) for such encumbrances or restrictions existing under or by reason of:

(A) contractual encumbrances or restrictions (i) in effect on the Issue Date, or (ii) pursuant to the Credit

Facilities and the related documentation and related Hedging Obligations;

(B) (i) the Indenture, the Notes and the Note Guarantees, (ii) the indentures governing the Existing Notes,

the Existing Notes and the guarantees thereof, including any future guarantees, (iii) the Security

70


-----

Documents and (iv) any agreement governing Indebtedness permitted to be incurred pursuant to the
covenant described under “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness”; provided that the provisions
relating to restrictions of the type described in clauses (1) through (3) above contained in such agreement,
taken as a whole, (i) are not materially more restrictive, taken as a whole, as determined in good faith by
the Company, than the provisions contained in the Credit Facilities, the Security Documents (including,
for the avoidance of doubt, in each case any amendments, supplements, modifications, restatements or
refinancings thereof), or in the Indenture or in the indentures governing the Existing Notes, as applicable,
in each case as in effect when initially executed or (ii) will not, in the good faith judgment of the
Company, affect the ability of the Company to make anticipated payments of principal, premium, if any,
interest or any other payments on the Notes;

(C) purchase money obligations and Capital Lease Obligations that impose restrictions of the nature

discussed in clause (3) above on the property so acquired or leased;

(D) applicable law or any applicable rule, regulation, license, permit or order;

(E) (i) in the case of the redesignation of an Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary or the merger,

amalgamation or consolidation of an Unrestricted Subsidiary into the Company or a Restricted
Subsidiary or the transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of an Unrestricted Subsidiary to the
Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, any agreement or other instrument of such Unrestricted Subsidiary
(but, in any such case, not created in contemplation thereof) and (ii) any agreement or other instrument
of a Person acquired by or merged or consolidated with or into the Company or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries (including the acquisition of a minority interest of such Person) in existence at the time of
such transaction (but not created in contemplation thereof), which encumbrance or restriction is not
applicable to any Person, or the properties or assets of any Person, other than the Person and its
Subsidiaries, or the property or assets of the Person and its Subsidiaries, so acquired;

(F) contracts for the direct or indirect sale or disposition of assets (including agreements in connection with

a sale and leaseback transaction or merger), including customary restrictions with respect to a Subsidiary
of the Company pursuant to an agreement that has been entered into for the direct or indirect sale or
disposition of any of the Capital Stock or assets of such Subsidiary;

(G) Secured Indebtedness otherwise permitted to be incurred pursuant to the covenants described under “—

Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness” and “—Liens” that limit the right of the debtor to dispose of
the assets securing such Indebtedness;

(H) restrictions on cash, Cash Equivalents or other deposits or net worth imposed by suppliers, customers or

landlords under contracts entered into in the ordinary course of business or arising in connection with
any Permitted Liens;

(I) other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock of Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries permitted to

be incurred subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the provisions of the covenant described under “—
Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness”;

(J) customary provisions in joint venture agreements or arrangements and other similar agreements or

arrangements relating solely to such joint venture or other arrangements;

(K) customary provisions contained in leases, sub-leases, licenses or sub-licenses and other agreements,

including with respect to intellectual property, in each case, entered into in the ordinary course of
business or as is typical in the same or similar industries or that in the judgment of the Company would
not materially impair the Company’s ability to make payments under the Notes when due;

(L) restrictions in agreements or instruments that prohibit the payment or making of dividends other than on

a pro rata basis;

(M) provisions restricting assignment of any agreement entered into in the ordinary course of business;

(N) customary provisions restricting subletting or assignment of any lease governing a leasehold interest of

any Restricted Subsidiary or the assignment of any license or sub-license agreement;

71


-----

(O) restrictions or conditions contained in any trading, netting, operating, construction, service, supply,

purchase, sale or other agreement to which the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries is a party
entered into in the ordinary course of business; provided, that such agreement prohibits the encumbrance
of solely the property or assets of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary that are the subject to such
agreement, the payment rights arising thereunder or the proceeds thereof and does not extend to any
other asset or property of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary or the assets or property of another
Restricted Subsidiary; and

(P) any encumbrances or restrictions of the type referred to in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above imposed by any

amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings, replacements
or refinancings of the contracts, instruments or obligations referred to in clauses (a) through (p) above;
_provided_ that such amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements,
refundings, replacements or refinancings are, in the good faith judgment of the Company, no more
restrictive in any material respect with respect to such encumbrance and other restrictions taken as a
whole than those prior to such amendment, modification, restatement, renewal, increase, supplement,
refunding, replacement or refinancing.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, (1) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving
dividends or liquidating distributions prior to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common equity shall
not be deemed a restriction on the ability to make distributions on Capital Stock and (2) the subordination of (including
the application of any standstill requirements to) loans and advances made to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary
to other Indebtedness incurred by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed a restriction on the
ability to make loans or advances.

**_Additional Guarantees_**

If the Company or any Wholly Owned Domestic Subsidiary acquires or creates another Wholly Owned Domestic
Subsidiary (other than an Excluded Subsidiary) after the Issue Date that provides a Guarantee of the Company’s or
any Guarantor’s obligations, or any Wholly Owned Domestic Subsidiary (other than an Excluded Subsidiary) becomes
an obligor, under any Material Indebtedness, then, within 30 days after such Wholly Owned Domestic Subsidiary
provides such Guarantee or becomes such an obligor, such Wholly Owned Domestic Subsidiary will execute a
supplemental indenture to the Indenture providing for a Note Guarantee by such Wholly Owned Domestic Subsidiary
and deliver such Security Documents or supplements thereto as may be necessary to provide a Lien on all of such
Guarantor’s assets (other than Excluded Assets); provided that any extensions of time or waivers as are granted by the
administrative agent under the Credit Agreement for the comparable requirement under the Credit Agreement or any
related loan document shall automatically be granted under the Indenture and the Security Documents. The Company
may elect, in its sole discretion, to cause any Subsidiary that is not otherwise required to provide a Note Guarantee to
become a Guarantor, in which case such Subsidiary shall not be required to comply with the 30-day period described
above.

**Provision of Financial Information**

The Company will provide to the Trustee, within 30 days after the Company files the same with the Commission,
copies of the annual reports and of the information, documents, and other reports (or copies of such portions of any of
the foregoing as the Commission may from time to time by rules and regulations prescribe) which the Company may
be required to file with the Commission pursuant to Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act or, if the
Company is not required to file information, documents, or reports pursuant to either of such Sections, then to provide
to the Trustee and the holders of the Notes:

(1) within 90 days after the end of each fiscal year of the Company, its audited consolidated balance sheet and

related statements of operations, stockholders’ equity and cash flows as of the end of and for such year,
setting forth in each case in comparative form the figures for the previous fiscal year, all reported on by
independent public accountants of recognized national standing to the effect that such consolidated financial
statements present fairly in all material respects the financial condition and results of operations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP; and

(2) within 45 days after the end of each fiscal quarter of the Company not corresponding with the fiscal year end,

its unaudited consolidated balance sheet and related statements of operations, stockholders’ equity and cash

72


-----

flows as of the end of and for such fiscal quarter and the then elapsed portion of the fiscal year, setting forth
in each case in comparative form the figures for the corresponding period or periods of (or, in the case of the
balance sheet, as of the end of) the previous fiscal year, all certified by its chief financial officer as presenting
fairly in all material respects the financial condition and results of operations of the Company and its
consolidated Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP, subject to normal year end audit
adjustments and the absence of footnotes, and accompanied by a statement by the directors of the Company
commenting on the performance of the Company and its subsidiaries for the quarter to which the financial
statements relate and any material developments or proposals affecting the Company or business.

The requirement for the Company to provide information may be satisfied by filing of such reports, documents
and information via the Commission’s EDGAR system (or any successor electronic filing system) or posting such
reports, documents and information on its website, in each case within the time periods specified herein, it being
understood that the Trustee shall have no responsibility whatsoever to determine if such filings have been made, and
that delivery of such reports, information and documents to the Trustee is for informational purposes only and the
Trustee’s receipt of such shall not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or determinable
from information contained therein, including the Company’s compliance with any of its covenants hereunder (as to
which the Trustee is entitled to rely exclusively on Officer’s Certificates). To the extent any information is not
provided within the time periods specified in the immediately preceding paragraph and such information is
subsequently provided, the Company will be deemed to have satisfied its obligations with respect thereto at such time
and any default or event of default with respect thereto shall be deemed to have been cured.

At any time when the Notes are “restricted securities” under Rule 144 under the Securities Act, the Company will
furnish to the holders of the Notes and prospective investors, upon their request, the information required to be
delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act.

**Covenant Suspension when Notes Obtain Investment Grade Rating**

Beginning on the day of a Covenant Suspension Event (as defined below) and ending on a Reversion Date (as
defined below) (such period a “Suspension Period”) with respect to the Notes, the covenants specifically listed under
the following captions in this “Description of Notes” will not be applicable to the Notes (collectively, the “Suspended
Covenants”):

(1) “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

(2) “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness”;

(3) clause (4) of the first paragraph of “—Consolidation, Merger and Conveyance, Transfer and Lease of Assets”;

(4) “—Asset Sales”;

(5) “—Transactions with Affiliates”;

(6) “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries”; and

(7) “—Additional Guarantees” (but only with respect to any Person that is required to become a Guarantor after

the date of the commencement of the applicable Suspension Period).

On each Reversion Date, (i) all Indebtedness Incurred, or Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock issued, during
the Suspension Period (or deemed incurred or issued in connection with a Limited Condition Transaction entered into
during the Suspension Period) will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as
permitted under clause (3) of the second paragraph under “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness”; (ii) any
Affiliate Transaction entered into after such reinstatement pursuant to an agreement entered into during any
Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (h) of the second paragraph of the covenant
described under “—Transactions with Affiliates”; (iii) any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted
Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor to take any action described in clauses (1) through (3) of the first paragraph of the
covenant described under “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries” that
becomes effective during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (a)(i) of the second
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted
Subsidiaries”; (iv) no Subsidiary of the Company shall be required to comply with the covenant described under “—

73


-----

Additional Guarantees” after such reinstatement with respect to any Guarantee or obligation entered into by such
Subsidiary during any Suspension Period; and (v) all Investments made during the Suspension Period (or deemed
made in connection with a Limited Condition Transaction entered into during the Suspension Period) will be classified
to have been made under clause (b)(i) of the definition of “Permitted Investments.”

Calculations made after the Reversion Date of the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under “—
Limitation on Restricted Payments” will be made as though the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted
Payments” had been in effect since the Issue Date and prior, but not during, the Suspension Period (including with
respect to a Limited Condition Transaction entered into during the Suspension Period). Accordingly, Restricted
Payments made during the Suspension Period will not reduce the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments
under the first paragraph of “—Limitation on Restricted Payments.”

As described above, (i) no Default or Event of Default will be deemed to have occurred on the Reversion Date as
a result of any actions taken by the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries during the Suspension Period that were
permitted at such time and none of the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall bear any liability for any actions
taken or events occurring during the Suspension Period, or any actions taken at any time pursuant to any contractual
obligation arising during any Suspension Period, in each case as a result of a failure to comply with the Suspended
Covenants during the Suspension Period (or, upon termination of the Suspension Period or after that time based solely
on any action taken or event that occurred during the Suspension Period), and (2) following a Reversion Date, the
Company and each Restricted Subsidiary will be permitted, without causing a Default or Event of Default, to honor,
comply with or otherwise perform any contractual commitments or obligations entered into or arising during any
Suspension Period and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby, including any payments thereunder.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, during the Suspension Period the Company shall not designate any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries to be Unrestricted Subsidiaries unless the Company would have been permitted to designate
such Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary if a Suspension Period had not been in effect for any period, and,
following the Reversion Date, such designation shall be deemed to have created an Investment or Restricted Payment
pursuant to the last paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” at the time of
such designation.

For purposes of the “—Asset Sales” covenant, on the Reversion Date, the unutilized Excess Proceeds amount
will be reset to zero.

The Note Guarantees will be suspended during the Suspension Period.

Any period of time that (i) the Notes have Investment Grade Ratings from at least two of Moody’s, S&P and
Fitch and (ii) no Default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture is referred to as a “Covenant Suspension
_Event.” If on any subsequent date (the “Reversion Date”) any of Moody’s, S&P and Fitch withdraws its Investment_
Grade Rating or downgrades the rating assigned to the Notes below an Investment Grade Rating (in each case, to the
extent any such rating agency has given an Investment Grade Rating) the result of which is that the Notes cease to
have an Investment Grade Rating from at least two of Moody’s, S&P and Fitch, then the Company and the Restricted
Subsidiaries will thereafter again be subject to the Suspended Covenants with respect to future events.

The Company shall deliver promptly to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate notifying it of the occurrence of any
Covenant Suspension Event or Reversion Date; _provided,_ _however, that the Trustee shall have no obligation to_
ascertain or verify the occurrence of any Covenant Suspension Event or Reversion Date.

There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain Investment Grade Ratings.

**Certain Calculations**

For purposes of determining compliance at any time with the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—
Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness,” “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments,” “—Certain
Covenants—Liens,” “—Certain Covenants—Consolidation, Merger and Conveyance, Transfer and Lease of Assets,”
“—Certain Covenants—Asset Sales” and “—Certain Covenants—Transactions with Affiliates,” in the event that any
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock, Preferred Stock, Lien, Restricted Payment, Permitted Investment, Disposition or
Affiliate Transaction, as applicable, meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of transactions or items
permitted pursuant to any clause of, or exception from, such covenants, the Company, in its sole discretion, from time

74


-----

to time, may classify or reclassify such transaction or item (or portion thereof) and will only be required to include the
amount and type of such transaction (or portion thereof) in any one category; _provided that Indebtedness under the_
Credit Agreement outstanding on the Issue Date shall at all times be classified as incurred under clause (1) of the
second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness”.
For purposes of determining the permissibility of any action, change, transaction or event that by the terms of the
Indenture requires a calculation of any financial ratio or test (including the Consolidated Senior Secured First Lien
Debt Ratio, the Total Net Leverage Ratio or the Secured Net Leverage Ratio), such financial ratio or test shall, except
as expressly permitted under the Indenture, be calculated at the time such action is taken, such change is made, such
transaction is consummated or such event occurs, as the case may be, and no default or Event of Default shall be
deemed to have occurred solely as a result of a change in such financial ratio or test occurring after the time such
action is taken, such change is made, such transaction is consummated or such event occurs, as the case may be. It is
understood and agreed that any Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock, Preferred Stock, Lien, Restricted Payment,
Disposition or Affiliate Transaction need not be permitted solely by reference to one category of permitted
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock, Preferred Stock, Liens, Restricted Payments, Permitted Investment, Dispositions or
Affiliate Transactions, respectively, but may instead be permitted in part under any combination thereof (it being
understood that compliance with each such covenant is separately required).

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) when calculating the availability under any basket, financial
ratio or test (including any Consolidated Senior Secured First Lien Debt Ratio test, any Secured Net Leverage Ratio
test, any Total Net Leverage Ratio test or the amount of Consolidated Net Income or Adjusted EBITDA) in connection
with the incurrence of Indebtedness, the issuance of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, the creation of Liens, the
making of any Disposition, the making of an Investment, the making of a Restricted Payment or the designation of
any Restricted Subsidiaries or Unrestricted Subsidiaries, (ii) determining compliance with any provision of the
Indenture which requires that no default or Event of Default (or any type of default or Event of Default) has occurred,
is continuing or would result therefrom or (iii) determining the satisfaction of all other conditions precedent to the
incurrence of Indebtedness, the issuance of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, the creation of Liens, the making
of any Disposition, the making of an Investment, the making of a Restricted Payment or the designation of any
Restricted Subsidiaries or Unrestricted Subsidiaries, in each case in connection with a Limited Condition Transaction
and any actions or transactions related thereto, the date of determination of such ratio or other provisions,
determination of whether any default or Event of Default has occurred, is continuing or would result therefrom,
determination of compliance with any representations or warranties or the satisfaction of any other conditions shall,
at the option of the Company (the Company’s election to exercise such option in connection with any Limited
Condition Transaction, an “LCT Election,” which LCT Election may be in respect of one or more of clauses (i), (ii)
or (iii)) be deemed to be the date the definitive agreements or other relevant definitive documentation (or, if applicable,
the date of delivery of a notice, declaration or making of a Restricted Payment or similar event) for such Limited
Condition Transaction are entered into (the “LCT Test Date”). If on a Pro Forma Basis after giving effect to such
Limited Condition Transaction and the other transactions to be entered into in connection therewith (including any
incurrence or issuance of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, and the use of proceeds thereof), with
such ratios, tests, baskets and other provisions calculated as if such Limited Condition Transaction or other
transactions had occurred at the beginning of the most recent Measurement Period ending prior to the LCT Test Date
for which financial statements have been (or are required to be) delivered pursuant to “— Provision of Financial
Information,” the Company could have taken such action on the relevant LCT Test Date in compliance with the
applicable ratios, tests, baskets or other provisions, such provisions shall be deemed to have been complied with,
unless an Event of Default pursuant to clause (1) or (2) of the first paragraph under “—Events of Default,” or, solely
with respect to the Company, clause (5) of the first paragraph under “—Events of Default,” shall be continuing on the
date such Limited Condition Transaction is consummated; _provided, that if financial statements for one or more_
subsequent fiscal quarters shall have become available, the Company may elect, in its sole discretion, to re-determine
all such ratios, tests, baskets or other provisions on the basis of such financial statements, in which case, such date of
redetermination shall thereafter be deemed to be the applicable LCT Test Date for purposes of such ratios, tests,
baskets or such other provisions. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) if, following the LCT Test Date, any of such ratios,
tests, baskets or other provisions are exceeded or breached as a result of fluctuations in such ratio, test or basket
(including due to fluctuations in Adjusted EBITDA or other components of such ratio, test or basket) or other
provisions at or prior to the consummation of the relevant Limited Condition Transactions, such ratios, tests, baskets
and other provisions will not be deemed to have been exceeded or failed to have been satisfied as a result of such
fluctuations solely for purposes of determining whether the Limited Condition Transaction is permitted hereunder;
_provided that if such ratios, tests or baskets improve as a result of such fluctuations, such improved ratios, tests and/or_
baskets may be utilized, and (ii) such ratios and compliance with such conditions shall not be tested at the time of

75


-----

consummation of such Limited Condition Transaction or related Specified Transactions, unless, other than if an Event
of Default pursuant to clause (1) or (2) of the first paragraph under “—Events of Default,” or, solely with respect to
the Company, clause (5) of the first paragraph under “— Events of Default,” shall be continuing on such date, the
Company elects, in its sole discretion, to test such ratios and compliance with such conditions on the date such Limited
Condition Transaction or related Specified Transactions is consummated. If the Company has made an LCT Election
for any Limited Condition Transaction, then in connection with any subsequent calculation of any ratio, test, basket
availability or compliance with any other provision hereunder on or following the relevant LCT Test Date and prior
to the earliest of the date on which such Limited Condition Transaction is consummated, the date that the definitive
agreement for such Limited Condition Transaction is terminated or expires without consummation of such Limited
Condition Transaction or the date the Company makes an election pursuant to clause (ii) of the immediately preceding
sentence, any such ratio, test, basket or compliance with any other provision hereunder shall be calculated on a Pro
Forma Basis assuming such Limited Condition Transaction and other transactions in connection therewith (including
any incurrence or issuance of Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock, and the use of proceeds thereof) had been
consummated on the LCT Test Date; provided that, for purposes of any Restricted Payment or payment of Restricted
Indebtedness, such ratio, test, basket or compliance with any other provision hereunder shall also be tested as if such
Limited Condition Transaction and other transactions in connection therewith (including any incurrence or issuance
of Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock, and the use of proceeds thereof) had not been consummated.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, with respect to any amounts incurred or transactions entered
into (or consummated) in reliance on a provision of the Indenture that does not require compliance with a financial
ratio (any such amounts, the “Fixed Amounts”) under any negative covenant set forth under “—Certain Covenants”
or the determination of the Incremental Amount substantially concurrently with any amounts incurred or transactions
entered into (or consummated) in reliance on a provision under such negative covenant or the determination of the
Incremental Amount that requires compliance with a financial ratio (including any Consolidated Senior Secured First
Lien Debt Ratio test, any Secured Net Leverage Ratio test and any Total Net Leverage Ratio test) (any such amounts,
the “Incurrence-Based Amounts”), it is understood and agreed that such Fixed Amounts shall be disregarded in the
calculation of the financial ratio or test applicable to any substantially concurrent utilization of such Incurrence-Based
Amounts.

If the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary takes an action which at the time of the taking of such action would
in the good faith determination of the Company be permitted under the applicable provisions of the Indenture based
on the financial statements available at such time, such action shall be deemed to have been made in compliance with
the Indenture notwithstanding any subsequent adjustments, modifications or restatements made in good faith to such
financial statements affecting any applicable financial metric (including Consolidated Net Income and Adjusted
EBITDA).

**Certain Definitions**

As used in this “Description of Notes” section, the following terms have the meanings set forth below. For
purposes of the Indenture, unless otherwise specifically indicated, the term “consolidated” with respect to any Person
refers to such Person consolidated with the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, and excludes from such
consolidation any Unrestricted Subsidiary as if such Unrestricted Subsidiary were not an Affiliate of such Person.

the applicable date of determination of such calculations, in each case with such pro forma adjustments as are
appropriate and consistent with the provisions set forth in the above paragraphs to this definition. For the avoidance
of doubt, if the Company elects to use the Agreement Date as the applicable date of determination in accordance with

be taken into account for purposes of determining compliance of the transaction with the Indenture.

**Events of Default**

Under the Indenture, an Event of Default with respect to the Notes is defined as any of the following:

(1) the Company defaults in payment when due and payable, upon redemption, acceleration or otherwise, of

principal of, or premium, if any, on the Notes;

(2) the Company defaults in the payment when due of interest, on or with respect to the Notes and such default

continues for a period of 30 days;

(3) the Company defaults in the performance of, or breaches any covenant, warranty or other agreement

contained in, the Indenture (other than a default in the performance or breach of a covenant, warranty or
agreement which is specifically dealt with in clauses (1) or (2) above) or the Security Documents and such
default or breach continues for a period of 60 days after either the Trustee or holders of at least 25% in
aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes have given the Company (with a copy to the Trustee if
given by the holders) written notice of the breach in the manner required by the Indenture;

(4) the Company fails to make any payment at maturity, after giving effect to any applicable grace period, on

any Indebtedness in a principal amount in excess of $150.0 million and continuance of this failure to pay or
(b) the Company defaults on any Indebtedness which default results in the acceleration of Indebtedness in a
principal amount in excess of $150.0 million without such Indebtedness having been discharged or the
acceleration having been cured, waived, rescinded or annulled, for a period of, in the case of clause (a) or (b)
above, 30 days or more after the Company receives written notice from the Trustee or the Trustee receives
written notice from the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding;
_provided, however, that if the failure, default or acceleration referred to in clause (a) or (b) above shall cease_
or be cured, waived, rescinded or annulled, then the Event of Default (and the consequences thereof) shall be
deemed cured, annulled and cease to exist;

(5) certain events of bankruptcy affecting the Company or any Significant Subsidiary;

(6) the Note Guarantee of a Significant Subsidiary or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together

as of the date of the most recent audited financial statements of the Company, would constitute a Significant
Subsidiary ceases to be in full force and effect (except as contemplated by the terms of the Indenture) or any
Guarantor denies or disaffirms its obligations under the Indenture, the Security Documents or any Note
Guarantee, other than by reason of the release of such Guarantee in accordance with the terms of the
Indenture; or

(7) (a) the Liens created by the Security Documents securing the Notes or Note Guarantees thereof shall at any

time not constitute perfected Liens on any portion of the Collateral intended to be covered thereby (to the
extent perfection is required by the Indenture or such Security Documents) other than in accordance with the
terms of such relevant Security Document and the Indenture and other than the satisfaction in full of all
Obligations under the Indenture or release or amendment of any such Lien in accordance with the terms of
the Indenture or such Security Documents, or (b) except for expiration in accordance with its terms or
amendment, modification, waiver, termination or release in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and

such default occurs with respect to a portion of the Collateral exceeding $50.0 million in fair market value,
or (c) the enforceability thereof shall be contested by the Company or any Guarantor.

If an Event of Default under the Indenture (other than an Event of Default specified in clause (5) above with
respect to the Company) shall occur and be continuing, the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount
of outstanding Notes under the Indenture may declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued interest on the
Notes to be immediately due and payable by notice in writing to the Company and the Trustee (if given by the holders)
specifying the respective Event of Default and that it is a “notice of acceleration” (the “Acceleration Notice”), and the
same shall become immediately due and payable.

103


-----

Any notice of Default, Acceleration Notice or instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of Default,
Acceleration Notice or take any other action (a “Noteholder Direction”) provided by any one or more Holders (each
a “Directing Holder”) must be accompanied by a written representation from each such Holder to the Company and
the Trustee that such Holder is not (or, in the case such Holder is the common depositary of Euroclear and Clearstream
or its nominee, that such Holder is being instructed solely by beneficial owners that have represented to such Holder
that they are not) Net Short (a “Position Representation”), which representation, in the case of a Noteholder Direction
relating to a notice of Default shall be deemed repeated at all times until the resulting Event of Default is cured or
otherwise ceases to exist or the Notes are accelerated. In addition, each Directing Holder must, at the time of providing
a Noteholder Direction, covenant to provide the Company with such other information as the Company may
reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such Holder’s Position Representation within
five Business Days of request therefor (a “Verification Covenant”). The Trustee shall have no duty whatsoever to
provide this information to the Company or to obtain this information for the Company. In any case in which the
Holder is the common depositary of Euroclear and Clearstream or its nominee, any Position Representation or
Verification Covenant required hereunder shall be provided by the beneficial owner of the Notes in lieu of the common
depositary of Euroclear and Clearstream or its nominee. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior
to the acceleration of the Notes, the Company determines in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a
Directing Holder providing such Noteholder Direction was, at any relevant time, in breach of its Position
Representation and provides to the Trustee evidence that the Company has filed papers with a court of competent
jurisdiction seeking a determination that such Directing Holder was, at such time, in breach of its Position
Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction,
the cure period with respect to such Event of Default shall be automatically stayed pending a final and non-appealable
determination of a court of competent jurisdiction on such matter. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction,
but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Company provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that a
Directing Holder failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant, the cure period with respect to any Event of Default that
resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction shall be automatically stayed pending satisfaction of such
Verification Covenant. Any breach of the Position Representation shall result in such Holder’s participation in such
Noteholder Direction being disregarded; and, if, without the participation of such Holder, the percentage of Notes held
by the remaining Holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been insufficient to validly provide
such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio, with the effect that such Event of Default
shall be deemed never to have occurred and the Trustee shall be deemed not to have received such Noteholder
Direction or any notice of such Event of Default; provided, however, this shall not invalidate any indemnity or security
provided by the Directing Holders to the Trustee which obligations shall continue to survive. With their acquisition
of the Notes, each Holder and subsequent purchaser of the Notes consents to the delivery of its Position Representation
by the Trustee to the Company in accordance with the terms of this section. Each Holder and subsequent purchaser of
the Notes waives in the Indenture any and all claims, in law and/or in equity, against the Trustee and agrees in the
Indenture not to commence any legal proceeding against the Trustee in respect of, and agrees in the Indenture that the
Trustee will not be liable for any action that the Trustee takes in accordance with this section, or arising out of or in
connection with following instructions or taking actions in accordance with a Noteholder Direction. The Company
agrees to waive in the Indenture any and all claims, in law and/or in equity, against the Trustee, and in the Indenture
not to commence any legal proceeding against the Trustee in respect of, and agree in the Indenture that the Trustee
will not be liable for any action that the Trustee takes in accordance with this section, or arising out of or in connection
with following instructions or taking actions in accordance with a Noteholder Direction except to the extent of the
Trustee’s gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Company will confirm in the Indenture that any and all other
actions that the Trustee takes or omits to take under this section and all fees, costs and expenses of the Trustee and its
agents and counsel arising hereunder and in connection herewith shall be covered by the Company’s indemnifications
under the indemnification section of the Indenture.

If an Event of Default specified in clause (5) above with respect to the Company occurs and is continuing, then
all unpaid principal of, and premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all of the outstanding Notes issued
under the Indenture shall ipso facto become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act
on the part of the Trustee or any holder of the Notes.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company so elects in writing to the Trustee, the sole remedy of the holders
for a failure to comply with the covenant described in “—Provision of Financial Information,” will for the first 180
days after the occurrence of such failure consist exclusively of the right to receive additional interest (“Additional
Interest”) on the Notes at a rate per annum equal to 0.25% for the first 180 days after the occurrence of such failure.
The Additional Interest will accrue on all outstanding Notes from and including the date on which such failure first

104


-----

occurs until such violation is cured or waived and shall be payable on each interest payment date to holders of record
on the regular record date immediately preceding the interest payment date. On the 181st day after such failure (if
such violation is not cured or waived prior to such 181st day), such failure will then constitute an Event of Default
without any further notice or lapse of time and the Notes will be subject to acceleration as provided above.

The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in
connection with another default (the “Initial Default”) occurs, then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such
Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default that resulted
solely because of that Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of
Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “Provision of Financial
Information” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Indenture shall be
deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or such notice or certificate, as
applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture.

The Indenture will provide that, at any time after a declaration of acceleration with respect to the Notes, the
holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may rescind and cancel such
declaration and its consequences:

(1) if the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree;

(2) if all existing Events of Default have been cured or waived except nonpayment of principal, premium, if any,

or accrued interest that has become due solely because of the acceleration;

(3) to the extent the payment of such interest is lawful, interest on overdue installments of interest and overdue

principal, which has become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration, has been paid;

(4) if the Company has paid the Trustee its reasonable compensation and reimbursed the Trustee for its expenses

(including fees and expenses of counsel), disbursements and advances; and

(5) in the event of the cure or waiver of an Event of Default under the Indenture of the type described in clause

(4) of the description above of Events of Default, the Trustee shall have received an Officer’s Certificate that
such Event of Default has been cured or waived.

No such rescission shall affect any subsequent Default under the Indenture or impair any right consequent thereto.

The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes issued and then outstanding under the
Indenture may waive any existing Default or Event of Default under the Indenture, and its consequences, except a
default in the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the Notes or a covenant or provision of the
Indenture which cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the holder of each outstanding Note affected.

Holders of the Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture. The Trustee
is under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Indenture at the request, order or direction of
any of the holders of the Notes, unless such holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity or security satisfactory to
the Trustee. Subject to all provisions of the Indenture and applicable law, the holders of a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any
proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The
Trustee may withhold from holders of the Notes notice of any continuing Default or Event of Default if it determines
that withholding notice is in their interest, except a Default or Event of Default relating to the payment of the principal
of, premium, if any, or interest on the Notes.

The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding compliance with the Indenture.
Upon becoming aware of any Default or Event of Default under the Indenture, the Company is required to deliver to
the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate specifying such Default or Event of Default and the remedial action the Company
proposes to take in connection therewith.

**Modification and Waiver**

Except as provided in the next two succeeding paragraphs, the Indenture, the Security Documents, the Notes
issued thereunder or the Note Guarantees provided thereunder may be amended or supplemented with the consent of

the Trustee shall be permitted, without the consent of any other Person, to amend the terms of the Indenture and the

with respect to the Notes that are described in the Indenture and have Liens, if any, on the Collateral securing the
Notes released (“Covenant Defeasance”) and thereafter any omission to comply with those covenants will not
constitute a Default or Event of Default with respect to the Notes issued thereunder. In the event that a Covenant
Defeasance occurs, certain events (not including nonpayment, bankruptcy, receivership, rehabilitation and insolvency
events of the Company) described under “—Events of Default” will no longer constitute an Event of Default with
respect to the Notes issued under the Indenture.

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance under the Indenture:

(1) the Company must irrevocably deposit with the Trustee, in trust, for the benefit of the holders of the Notes

issued thereunder, cash in euro, non-callable Euro Government Obligations, or a combination of cash in euro
and non-callable Euro Government Obligations, in amounts as will be sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally
recognized investment bank, appraisal firm or firm of independent public accountants delivered to the
Trustee, to pay the principal of, or interest and premium, if any, on the outstanding Notes issued thereunder
on the stated maturity or on the applicable redemption date, as the case may be, and the Company must
specify whether the Notes are being defeased to maturity or to a particular redemption date;

(2) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel confirming

that (a) the Company has received from, or there has been published by, the Internal Revenue Service a ruling
or (b) since the Issue Date, there has been a change in the applicable U.S. federal income tax law, in either
case to the effect that, and based thereon such Opinion of Counsel will confirm that, the beneficial owners of
the outstanding Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result
of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner
and at the same times as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred;

(3) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel

confirming that the beneficial owners of the outstanding Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for
U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal
income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if
such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred;

(4) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture on the date of such deposit

(other than a Default or Event of Default resulting from or arising in connection with the borrowing of funds
to be applied to such deposit and the grant of any Lien securing such borrowings);

(5) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance will not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a

default under any material agreement or instrument (other than the Indenture) to which the Company or any
Guarantor is a party or by which the Company or any Guarantor is bound;

(6) the Company must deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit referred to in clause

(1) was not made by the Company with the intent of preferring the holders of the Notes over the other
creditors of the Company or any Guarantor or with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding
creditors of the Company or any Guarantor or others; and

(7) the Company must deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating

that all conditions precedent relating to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant Defeasance of the Notes have
been complied with.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Opinion of Counsel required by clauses (2) and (3) above with respect to a
Legal Defeasance or a Covenant Defeasance, as applicable, need not be delivered if all the Notes not theretofore
delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (x) have become due and payable or (y) will become due and payable on the

108


-----

maturity date within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by
the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Company.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect and the Liens, if any, on the Collateral
securing the Notes will be released, when:

(1) either:

(A) all the Notes that have been authenticated, except lost, stolen or destroyed Notes that have been replaced

or paid and Notes for whose payment money has theretofore been deposited in trust or segregated and
held in trust by the Company and thereafter repaid to the Company, have been delivered to the Trustee
for cancellation; or

(B) all the Notes that have not been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation have become due and payable

by reason of the giving of a notice of redemption or otherwise or will become due and payable by reason
of the giving of a notice of redemption or otherwise within one year and the Company has irrevocably
deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust solely for the benefit of the
holders of the Notes, cash in euro, non-callable Euro Government Obligations or a combination thereof,
in amounts as will be sufficient, without consideration of any reinvestment of interest, in the opinion of
a nationally recognized investment bank, appraisal firm or firm of independent public accountants,
delivered to the Trustee, to pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness on the Notes not delivered to the
Trustee for cancellation for principal, premium, if any, and accrued interest to the date of maturity or
redemption;

(2) in the case of subclause (1)(b) above, no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under

the Indenture on the date of the deposit or will occur as a result of the deposit (other than a Default or Event
of Default resulting from or arising in connection with borrowing of funds to be applied to such deposit and
the grant of any Lien securing such borrowing) and the deposit will not result in a breach or violation of, or
constitute a default under, any other material instrument to which the Company is a party or by which the
Company is bound;

(3) the Company has paid or caused to be paid all sums payable by it under the Indenture; and

(4) the Company has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee under the Indenture to apply the deposited

money toward the payment of the Notes issued thereunder at maturity or the redemption date, as the case
may be.

In addition, the Company must deliver an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel to the Trustee stating
that all conditions precedent to satisfaction and discharge have been satisfied.

**Governing Law**

New York law will govern the Indenture, the Notes and the Note Guarantees.

**Concerning the Trustee**

Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas will be the Trustee under the Indenture. If the Trustee becomes a
creditor of the Company, the Indenture limits its right to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on
certain property received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to engage
in other transactions; however, if it acquires any conflicting interest it must eliminate such conflict within 90 days.

**Notices**

All notices shall be deemed to have been given (i) if to the holder of a non-global Note, upon the mailing by first
class mail, postage prepaid, of such notices to the holder at its registered address as recorded in the Notes register, and
(ii) if to the holder of a Global Note, upon delivery of such notices to the depositary in accordance with its applicable

109


-----

procedures, in each case, not later than the latest date, and not earlier than the earliest date, prescribed in the Notes for
the giving of such notice.

Neither the failure to give any notice to a particular holder, nor any defect in a notice given to a particular holder,
will affect the sufficiency of any notice given to another holder.

**Jurisdiction**

The Company and the Guarantors will consent to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any court of the State of New
York or any U.S. federal court, in each case, sitting in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, New York,
United States, and any appellate court from any thereof.

**Form and Registration**

The Notes will be issued in registered form without interest coupons. No Notes will be issued in bearer form.

110


-----

**BOOK-ENTRY, SETTLEMENT AND CLEARANCE**

**The Global Notes**

The Notes will be issued in the form of several registered notes in global form, without interest coupons, as
follows: Notes sold to QIBs under Rule 144A will be represented by the Rule 144A global notes (the “Rule 144A
Global Notes”); Notes sold in offshore transactions to non-U.S. persons in reliance on Regulation S will be represented
by the Regulation S global notes initially to be represented by the temporary Regulation S global notes and, after
completion of the global note exchange described below, by the permanent Regulation S global notes (the “Regulation
S Global Notes” and, together with the Rule 144A Global Notes, the “Global Notes”) and any Notes sold in the
secondary market to institutional accredited investors will be represented by the Institutional Accredited Investor
global notes. Upon issuance, the Global Notes will be deposited with, on or behalf of, the common depositary (the
“Common Depositary”) for the accounts of Euroclear Bank, SA./NV (“Euroclear”) and Clearstream Banking, S.A.
(“Clearstream”) and registered in the name of the nominee of the Common Depositary.

**Exchanges Among the Global Notes**

The distribution compliance period (the “Distribution Compliance Period”) will begin on the closing date of this
offering and end 40 days after the closing date. During the Distribution Compliance Period, beneficial interests in the
Regulation S Global Notes may be transferred only to non-U.S. persons under Regulation S, QIBs under Rule 144A
or institutional accredited investors. Beneficial interests in one Global Note may generally be exchanged for interests
in another Global Note. Depending on whether the transfer is being made during or after the Distribution Compliance
Period, and to which Global Note the transfer is being made, the Trustee may require the seller to provide certain
written certifications in the form provided in the Indenture. In addition, in the case of a transfer of interests to the
Institutional Accredited Investor global note, the Trustee may require the buyer to deliver a representation letter in the
form provided in the Indenture that states, among other things, that the buyer is not acquiring Notes with a view to
distributing them in violation of the Securities Act.

A beneficial interest in a Global Note that is transferred to a person who takes delivery through another Global
Note will, upon transfer, become subject to any transfer restrictions and other procedures applicable to beneficial
interests in the other Global Note.

During the Distribution Compliance Period, beneficial interests in the temporary Regulation S Global Notes and
Rule 144A Global Notes may be transferred only to non-U.S. persons under Regulation S, QIBs under Rule 144A or
institutional accredited investors. After the Distribution Compliance Period ends, beneficial interests in the temporary
Regulation S Global Notes and Rule 144A Global Notes may be exchanged for beneficial interests in the permanent
Regulation S Global Notes and Rule 144A Global Notes, respectively, upon certification that those interests are owned
either by non-U.S. persons or by U.S. persons who purchased those interests pursuant to an exemption from, or in
transactions not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Beneficial interests in the Global Note
may not be exchanged for Notes in physical, certificated form except in the limited circumstances described below.
Each Global Note and beneficial interests in each Global Note will be subject to restrictions on transfer as described
in the section titled “Transfer Restrictions.”

**Book-Entry Procedures for the Global Notes**

All interests in the Global Note will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, as
applicable. We provide the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the convenience of
investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that settlement system and may
be changed at any time. Neither we, the Trustee, nor the initial purchasers take any responsibility for those operations
or procedures, and we and the initial purchasers urge investors to contact the system or their participants directly to
discuss these matters.

Euroclear and Clearstream have established procedures to facilitate transfers of interests in global notes among
participants in those settlement systems. However, the settlement systems are not obligated to perform these
procedures and may discontinue or change these procedures at any time. Neither we nor the Trustee will have any

111


-----

responsibility for the performance by Euroclear or Clearstream or their participants or indirect participants of their
obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

Euroclear has advised us that it was created in 1968 to hold securities for its participants and to clear and settle
transactions between Euroclear participants through simultaneous electronic book-entry delivery against payment,
thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of certificates and any risk from lack of simultaneous transfers
of securities and cash. Euroclear provides various other services, including securities lending and borrowing and
interfaces with domestic markets in several countries. All operations are conducted by Euroclear Bank, SA/ NV and
all Euroclear securities clearance accounts and Euroclear cash accounts are accounts with Euroclear Bank, not
Euroclear Clearance Systems S.C. (the “Cooperative”). The Cooperative establishes policy for Euroclear on behalf of
Euroclear participants. Euroclear participants include banks (including central banks), securities brokers and dealers
and other professional financial intermediaries and may include the underwriters. Indirect access to Euroclear is also
available to other firms that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear participant, either
directly or indirectly.

Securities clearance accounts and cash accounts with Euroclear Bank are governed by the Terms and Conditions
Governing Use of Euroclear and the related Operating Procedures of the Euroclear System, and applicable Belgian
laws (collectively, the “Euroclear Terms and Conditions”). The Euroclear Terms and Conditions govern transfers of
securities and cash within Euroclear, withdrawals of securities and cash from Euroclear and receipts of payment with
respect to securities in Euroclear. All securities in Euroclear are held on a fungible basis without attribution of specific
certificates to specific securities clearance accounts. Euroclear Bank acts under the Euroclear Terms and Conditions
only on behalf of Euroclear participants and has no record of or relationship with persons holding through Euroclear
participants.

Distributions with respect to the Notes held beneficially through Euroclear will be credited to the cash accounts
of Euroclear participants in accordance with the Euroclear Terms and Conditions, to the extent received by the
Euroclear Bank and by Euroclear.

Clearstream is incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg as a professional depository. Clearstream holds
securities for Clearstream participants and facilitates the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between
Clearstream participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of Clearstream participants, thereby
eliminating the need for physical movement of certificates. Clearstream provides to its participants, among other
things, services for safekeeping, administration, clearance and settlement of internationally traded securities and
securities lending and borrowing. Clearstream also deals with domestic securities markets in several countries. As a
professional depository, Clearstream is subject to regulation by the Luxembourg Monetary Institute. Clearstream
participants are financial institutions around the world including underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks,
trust companies and clearing corporations and certain other organizations and may include the initial purchasers.
Indirect access to Clearstream is also available to others, such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear
through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Clearstream participant either directly or indirectly.

Distributions with respect to the Notes held beneficially through Clearstream will be credited to cash accounts of
Clearstream participants in accordance with its rules and procedures, to the extent received by Clearstream.

_Certificated Notes_

Notes in physical, certificated form will be issued and delivered to each person that DTC identifies as a beneficial
owner of the related Notes only if: (i) Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, notifies us at any time that it is
unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for the Global Notes and a successor depositary is not appointed; (ii)
Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, ceases to be registered as a clearing agency under the Exchange Act and a
successor depositary is not appointed; or (iii) certain other events provided in the Indenture should occur.

**U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

The following discussion is a summary of U.S. federal income tax considerations generally applicable to the
ownership, sale or other disposition of the Notes by investors who acquire Notes pursuant to this offering at the “issue
price” for such Notes (the first price at which a substantial amount of Notes is sold for money to investors, not
including bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement
agents or wholesalers). This summary is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”),
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, administrative rulings and judicial decisions, all in effect as of the date
hereof, all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations, possibly with retroactive effect. This summary
does not discuss all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be important to particular investors in light of
their individual circumstances, including, but not limited to, investors subject to special tax rules (e.g., former citizens
and former long-term residents of the United States, “controlled foreign corporations,” “passive foreign investment
companies,” and banks, insurance companies, or other financial institutions), investors that will hold the Notes as a
part of a straddle, hedge, conversion, synthetic security, constructive ownership transaction or other integrated
transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, accrual basis taxpayers subject to special tax accounting rules
pursuant to Section 451(b) of the Code, or entities that are treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes
and partners of such partnerships, all of whom may be subject to tax rules that differ materially from those summarized
below. In addition, this summary does not discuss other U.S. federal tax consequences (e.g., estate or gift tax or the
Medicare tax on certain investment income) or any state, local, or non-U.S. tax considerations. This summary is
written for investors that will hold the Notes offered hereby as “capital assets” (generally, property held for
investment) under the Code.

**_The U.S. federal income tax treatment of the holders of the Notes depends in some instances on determinations_**
**_of facts and interpretations of complex provisions of U.S. federal income tax law for which no clear precedent or_**
**_authority may be available. In addition, the tax consequences to any particular holder of the Notes will depend_**
**_upon the holder’s particular tax circumstances. Each investor is urged to consult its tax advisors regarding the_**
**_U.S. federal, state, local, estate and gift and non-U.S. income and other tax considerations applicable to it, in light_**
**_of its particular circumstances, of acquiring, holding, exchanging, or otherwise disposing of the Notes._**

If any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the Notes, the
treatment of a partner (or person or entity treated as a partner) in the partnership will generally depend upon the status
of the partner and the activities of the partnership and certain determinations made at the partner level. Investors that
are partnerships and partners in such partnerships are urged to consult their tax advisors about the U.S. federal income
tax consequences of purchasing, holding and disposing of Notes.

**Additional Payments**

In certain circumstances, we will be required to pay amounts on the Notes in excess of the stated interest and
principal payable on the Notes or will be required to pay amounts prior to the normally scheduled payment dates. For
example, if we experience specific kinds of change of control triggering events with respect to the Notes, we will be
required to offer to repurchase all or part of the Notes at 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to but excluding the date of redemption (see “Description of Notes—Repurchase of Notes Upon a
Change of Control Triggering Event”). We intend to take the position that such circumstances are a remote possibility
and therefore do not intend to treat the Notes as subject to the special rules governing certain contingent payment debt
instruments (which, if applicable, would affect the timing, amount and character of income with respect to a Note).
Our determination in this regard is not, however, binding on the IRS and it is possible the IRS may take a position
which results in different tax consequences than those described below. The following discussion assumes that the
Notes will not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

**U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders**

For purposes of this summary, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, is an individual, corporation, estate or trust and is (i) an individual who is a U.S. citizen or a resident of the
United States, (ii) a corporation or other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created
in or organized under the law of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia, (iii) an estate the
income of which is includible in gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes regardless of its source, or (iv) a
trust (A) the administration of which is subject to the primary supervision of a U.S. court and with respect to which

113


-----

one or more “United States persons” (within the meaning of the Code) have the authority to control all substantial
decisions of the trust or (B) that has in effect a valid election under applicable United States Department of the Treasury
regulations to be treated as a United States person.

It is expected, and this discussion assumes, that the Notes will be issued with no more than a de minimis amount
(as determined under applicable Treasury Regulations) of original issue discount. If, however, the principal amount
of the Notes exceeds their issue price by a specified _de minimis amount or more (as determined under applicable_
Treasury Regulations), a U.S. Holder will be required to include that excess in income as original issue discount, as it
accrues, in accordance with a constant yield method based on a compounding of interest, before the receipt of cash
attributable to this income.

This discussion describes certain special rules applicable to U.S. Holders who have a U.S. dollar functional
currency that hold debt instruments that are denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar (such as the Notes).
The rules applicable to the Notes could require some or all of the gain or loss on the sale, exchange or other disposition
of the Notes to be recharacterized as ordinary income or loss. The rules applicable to the Notes are complex, and their
application may depend on a U.S. Holder’s particular U.S. federal income tax situation. U.S. Holders should consult
their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of the Notes.

**_Payments of Interest on the Notes. Interest paid on a Note will be taxable to a U.S. Holder as ordinary interest_**
income at the time it accrues or is received in accordance with the U.S. Holder’s method of accounting for U.S. federal
income tax purposes.

U.S. Holders using the cash method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes will be required to include
in income the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency payment on a Note when the payment of interest is received
(including a payment attributable to accrued but unpaid interest upon the sale, exchange, redemption, repurchase or
other taxable disposition of a Note). The U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency payment is determined by translating
the foreign currency received at the spot rate for such foreign currency on the date the payment is received, regardless
of whether the payment is in fact converted to U.S. dollars at that time. The U.S. dollar value will be the U.S. Holder’s
tax basis in the foreign currency received. A U.S. Holder will not recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss
with respect to the receipt of such payment.

U.S. Holders using the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes will be required to
include in income the U.S. dollar value of the amount of interest income that has accrued and is otherwise required to
be taken into account with respect to a Note during an accrual period. The U.S. dollar value of the accrued income
will be determined by translating the income at the average rate of exchange for the accrual period or, with respect to
an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average rate for the partial period within the taxable year. A U.S.
Holder may elect, however, to translate the accrued interest income using the spot rate on the last day of the accrual
period or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, using the exchange rate on the last day of the
taxable year. If the last day of an accrual period is within five business days of the date of receipt of the accrued
interest, a U.S. Holder may translate the interest using the spot rate on the date of receipt. The above election will
apply to all other debt obligations held by the U.S. Holder and may not be changed without the consent of the IRS.
U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors before making the above election. Upon receipt of an interest
payment (including upon the sale, exchange, redemption or other taxable disposition of the Notes, the receipt of
proceeds which include amounts attributable to accrued interest previously included in income), the holder will
recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value
of such payment (determined by translating the foreign currency received at the spot rate for such foreign currency on
the date such payment is received) and the U.S. dollar value of the interest income previously included in income with
respect to such payment. This gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss.

**_Foreign Currency Exchange Gain or Loss. If a U.S. Holder purchases a Note with previously owned foreign_**
currency, foreign currency exchange gain or loss (which will be treated as ordinary income or loss) will be recognized
in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the tax basis in the foreign currency and the U.S. dollar fair
market value of the foreign currency used to purchase the Note, determined on the date of purchase.

The tax basis in foreign currency received as interest on a Note will be the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency
determined at the spot rate in effect on the date the foreign currency is received. Any gain or loss recognized on a sale,

114


-----

exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of foreign currency (including its exchange for U.S.
dollars or its use to purchase debt securities) will be U.S. source ordinary income or loss.

**_Disposition of the Notes. Upon a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, a_**
U.S. Holder will recognize taxable gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the disposition
and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Note, which will generally equal the cost of the Note. The amount
realized will be equal to the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency on the date the payment is received or the Notes
are disposed of (or deemed disposed of as a result of a material change in the terms of the Notes), less any portion
allocable to any accrued and unpaid stated interest, which portion will be taxed as ordinary interest income. The
amount of any payment in or adjustments measured by foreign currency will be equal to the U.S. dollar value of the
foreign currency on the date of the purchase or adjustment. If, however, a Note is traded on an established securities
market, and the U.S. Holder uses the cash basis method of tax accounting, the U.S. dollar value of the amount realized
will be determined by translating the foreign currency payment at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of
the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition. A U.S. Holder that uses the accrual basis
method of tax accounting may elect the same treatment with respect to the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or
other taxable disposition of Notes traded on an established securities market, provided that the election is applied
consistently.

Except with respect to the foreign currency rules discussed below, gain or loss realized on the sale, exchange,
retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note will generally be capital gain or loss and will be longterm capital gain or loss if at the time of the disposition the Note has been held for more than one year. Long-term
capital gains recognized by noncorporate taxpayers are subject to reduced tax rates. The deductibility of capital losses
is subject to limitations.

A portion of the gain or loss with respect to the principal amount of a Note may be treated as foreign currency
exchange gain or loss. Foreign currency exchange gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss. For these
purposes, the principal amount of the Notes is the purchase price for the Notes calculated in the foreign currency on
the date of purchase, and the amount of exchange gain or loss recognized is equal to the difference between (i) the
U.S. dollar value of the principal amount determined on the date of the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other
taxable disposition of the Note and (ii) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount determined on the date the Note
was purchased. The amount of foreign currency exchange gain or loss will be limited to the amount of overall gain or
loss realized on the disposition of the Notes.

The tax basis in foreign currency received on the sale, exchange, retirement, or other disposition of a Note will
be equal to the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency, determined at the time of the sale, exchange, retirement,
redemption or other taxable disposition. As discussed above, if the Notes are traded on an established securities
market, a cash basis U.S. Holder (or, upon election, an accrual basis U.S. Holder) will determine the U.S. dollar value
of the foreign currency by translating the foreign currency received at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date
of the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition. Accordingly, in such case, no foreign
currency exchange gain or loss will result from currency fluctuations between the trade date and settlement date of a
sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition. Any gain or loss recognized on a sale, exchange,
retirement, redemption, or other taxable disposition of foreign currency (including its exchange for U.S. dollars or its
use to purchase debt securities) will be ordinary income or loss.

**_Information reporting and backup withholding._** Information returns generally will be filed with the IRS in
connection with payments on the Notes and the proceeds from a sale or other disposition of the Notes. A U.S. Holder
will be subject to backup withholding on these payments if the U.S. Holder fails to provide its correct taxpayer
identification number to the applicable withholding agent and comply with certain certification procedures or
otherwise establish an exemption from backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. The amount
of any backup withholding from a payment to a U.S. Holder will be allowed as a credit against the U.S. Holder’s U.S.
federal income tax liability and may entitle the U.S. Holder to a refund, provided that the required information is
timely furnished to the IRS.

**U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders**

For purposes of this summary, a “Non-U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that is not a U.S. Holder.

115


-----

**_Interest. Subject to any backup withholding or withholding under FATCA (as defined below), in each case as_**
discussed below, all payments of interest to a Non-U.S. Holder will be exempt from U.S. federal income and
withholding tax, provided that: (i) such Non-U.S. Holder does not own, actually or constructively, 10% or more of the
total combined voting power of all classes of our stock entitled to vote; (ii) such Non-U.S. Holder is not a controlled
foreign corporation related, directly or indirectly, to us through sufficient stock ownership; (iii) such interest is not
effectively connected with such Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a U.S. trade or business; (iv) such Non-U.S. Holder is
not a bank receiving interest described in section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code; and (v) such Non-U.S. Holder certifies,
under penalties of perjury, to the applicable withholding agent on IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or appropriate
substitute form) that it is not a United States person and provides its name, address and certain other required
information, or certain other certification requirements are satisfied.

If a Non-U.S. Holder cannot satisfy the requirements described above, payments of interest will be subject to the
30% U.S. federal withholding tax, unless such Non-U.S. Holder provides the applicable withholding agent with a
properly executed (i) IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or appropriate substitute form) claiming an exemption from
or reduction in withholding tax under the benefit of an applicable income tax treaty or (ii) IRS Form W-8ECI (or
appropriate substitute form) stating that interest paid or accrued on the Notes is not subject to withholding tax because
it is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States.

If a Non-U.S. Holder is engaged in a trade or business in the United States, and if interest on the Notes is
effectively connected with the conduct of such trade or business (and, if a tax treaty applies, is attributable to
permanent establishment), the Non-U.S. Holder will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income
basis on such interest in the same manner as if the

Non-U.S. Holder were a United States person, unless an applicable income tax treaty provides otherwise. In
addition, if such a Non-U.S. Holder is a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such holder may also be
subject to a branch profits tax equal to 30% (or such lower rate provided by an applicable treaty) of its effectively
connected earnings and profits for the taxable year, subject to certain adjustments.

**_Disposition of the Notes. Subject to any backup withholding or withholding under FATCA (as defined below),_**
in each case as discussed below, and except with respect to accrued but unpaid interest, which will be taxable as
described above under “—Interest,” a Non-U.S. Holder will generally not be subject to U.S. federal income or
withholding tax on the receipt of payments of principal on a Note, or on any gain recognized upon the sale, exchange,
retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, unless in the case of gain (i) such gain is effectively
connected with the conduct by such Non-U.S. Holder of a trade or business within the United States (in which case
such gain will be taxed as discussed below) or (ii) such Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United
States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of disposition, and certain other conditions are met (in which case such
Non-U.S. Holder will be subject to a flat 30% tax on the gain derived from the sale, which may be offset by U.S.source capital losses).

If a Non-U.S. Holder is engaged in a trade or business in the United States, and if gain recognized on the sale,
exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of the Notes, is effectively connected with the conduct
of such trade or business (and, if a tax treaty applies, is attributable to a permanent establishment), the Non-U.S.
Holder will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis on such gain in the same manner as
if the Non-U.S. Holder were a United States person, unless an applicable income tax treaty provides otherwise. In
addition, if such a Non-U.S. Holder is a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such holder may also be
subject to a branch profits tax equal to 30% (or such lower rate provided by an applicable treaty) of its effectively
connected earnings and profits for the taxable year, subject to certain adjustments.

**_Information reporting and backup withholding._** A Non-U.S. Holder may be required to comply with certain
certification procedures to establish that the holder is not a United States person in order to avoid backup withholding
with respect to our payments of principal and interest on, or the proceeds of the sale or other disposition of, a Note.
Such requirements are generally satisfied by providing a properly executed IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or
appropriate substitute form), as described above. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld
under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a refund or a credit against that Non-U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal
income tax liability provided the required information is furnished to the IRS. In certain circumstances, the name and
address of the Non-U.S. Holder and the amount of interest paid on the Non-U.S. Holder’s Note, as well as the amount,
if any, of tax withheld, may be reported to the IRS. Copies of these information returns generally may also be made

available under the provisions of a specific treaty or agreement to the tax authorities of the country in which the NonU.S. Holder resides.

**_Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act. Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations_**
and administrative guidance promulgated thereunder (“FATCA”) generally impose withholding at a rate of 30% in
certain circumstances on interest payable on the Notes held by or through certain financial institutions (including
investment funds), unless such institution (x) enters into, and complies with, an agreement with the IRS to report, on
an annual basis, information with respect to interests in, and accounts maintained by, the institution that are owned by
certain U.S. persons or by certain non-U.S. entities that are wholly or partially owned by U.S. persons and to withhold
on certain payments, (y) if required under an intergovernmental agreement between the United States and an applicable
foreign country, reports such information to its local tax authority, which will then exchange such information with
the U.S. authorities, or (z) otherwise qualifies for an exemption from withholding under FATCA. Accordingly, the
entity through which the Notes are held will affect the determination of whether such withholding is required.
Similarly, interest payable on the Notes held by or through an entity that is a non-financial non-U.S. entity that does
not qualify under certain exemptions generally will be subject to withholding at a rate of 30%, unless such entity either
(x) certifies that such entity does not have any “substantial United States owners”, (y) provides certain information
regarding the entity’s “substantial United States owners,” which we will in turn provide to the United States
Department of the Treasury, or (z) otherwise qualifies for an exemption from withholding under FATCA.

Current provisions of the Code and Treasury Regulations would also treat gross proceeds from the disposition of
the Notes as subject to FATCA withholding. However, proposed Treasury Regulations, if finalized in their current
form, would eliminate FATCA withholding on gross proceeds entirely. Taxpayers generally may rely on those
proposed regulations until final Treasury Regulations are issued.

If withholding under FATCA is required on any payment related to the Notes, investors not otherwise subject to
withholding (or that otherwise would be entitled to a reduced rate of withholding) on such payment may be required
to seek a refund or credit from the IRS to obtain the benefit of such exemption (or reduction). Prospective investors
should consult their tax advisors regarding the possible implications of FATCA on an investment in the Notes.

**ERISA AND OTHER PLAN CONSIDERATIONS**

Sections 404 and 406 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”) and
Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) restrict certain transactions by employee
benefit plans that are subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of Title I of ERISA, plans, accounts and other
arrangements that are subject to Section 4975 of the Code, and entities the underlying assets of which are deemed to
include assets of any such employee benefit plan, plan, account or arrangement (all of the foregoing, collectively,
“Plans”) and impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of such Plans with respect to the investment of Plan
assets.

Certain employee benefit plans, including governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), certain
church plans (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA) and non-U.S. plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA),
are not subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, but may be
subject to state, local, federal, non-U.S. or other laws or regulations substantively similar to such provisions of ERISA
or the Code (“Similar Laws”).

Any fiduciary or other person making a decision to invest assets of a Plan or a plan subject to Similar Law in the
Notes should review carefully with their legal advisers and determine, among other things, whether the investment is
in accordance with the documents and instruments governing such Plan or plan and the applicable provisions of
ERISA, the Code or any Similar Laws relating to a fiduciary’s duties to such Plan or plan, including the prudence and
diversification provisions of ERISA, and whether the acquisition, holding or disposition of the Notes (or any interest
in a Note) could constitute or give rise to a non-exempt prohibited transaction under ERISA or the Code, (as discussed
below) or a violation of any Similar Law. A violation of the prohibited transaction rules may result, among other
possible effects, in imposition of an excise tax or other penalties or liabilities under ERISA and the Code.

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit Plans from engaging in specified transactions
involving Plan assets with persons or entities who are “parties in interest” within the meaning of ERISA or
“disqualified persons” within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless an exemption is available.

The acquisition or holding of the Notes (or any interest in a Note) by or on behalf of a Plan could give rise to a
prohibited transaction if the transaction is with a party in interest or disqualified person with respect to that Plan. For
example, the acquisition or holding of the Notes (or any interest in a Note) by or on behalf of a Plan could be considered
to constitute or give rise to a prohibited transaction if persons such as the Issuer, an initial purchaser, the trustee or
any of their respective affiliates (collectively, the “Transaction Parties”) is or becomes a party in interest or disqualified
person with respect to the Plan.

In that regard, certain exemptions from the prohibited transaction rules could be applicable to the acquisition and
holding of the Notes (or any interest in a Note) by a Plan, depending on the circumstances. Included among these
prohibited transaction exemptions are: the statutory exemption under Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section
4975(d)(20) of the Code, regarding transactions with certain non-fiduciary service providers to Plans; prohibited
transaction class exemption (“PTCE”) 90-1, regarding investments by insurance company pooled separate accounts;
PTCE 95-60, as amended by PTCE 2002-13, regarding investments by insurance company general accounts; PTCE
91-38, as amended by PTCE 2002-13, regarding investments by bank collective investment funds; PTCE 96-23,
regarding transactions effected by in-house asset managers; and PTCE 84-14, as amended by PTCE 2002-13,
regarding transactions effected by “qualified professional asset managers.” However, the scope of relief under these
prohibited transaction exemptions might not cover all acts that could be considered prohibited transactions in
connection with investment in the Notes by Plans. No assurance can be given that any of the above exemptions, or
any other exemptions, would cover any or all prohibited transactions that might arise in connection with a Plan’s
acquisition, holding and disposition of the Notes (or any interest in a Note).

Accordingly, each purchaser or transferee of the Notes (or any interest in a Note) will be deemed to represent and
warrant that either (i) it is not, and is not directly or indirectly acquiring the Notes (or any interest in a Note) for, on
behalf of or with any assets of, a Plan or a plan subject to Similar Law or (ii) its acquisition, holding and disposition
of the Notes (or any interest in a Note) will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under
Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a violation of Similar Law and none of the Transaction Parties
are or will be a fiduciary with respect to the acquisition, holding or disposition of the Notes by any Plan or any plan
subject to Similar Law.

118


-----

Each purchaser and holder of the Notes has the exclusive responsibility for ensuring that its purchase, holding
and subsequent disposition of the Notes do not violate the fiduciary or prohibited transaction rules of ERISA or the
Code or provisions of any applicable Similar Laws. The sale of any Notes to any Plan or any plan subject to Similar
Law is in no respect a representation by any of the Transaction Parties or any of their representatives that such an
investment is appropriate for, or meets all relevant legal requirements with respect to investments by, Plans or plans
subject to Similar Laws generally or any particular Plan or plan subject to Similar Law. Neither discussion nor
anything in this offering memorandum is or is intended to be investment advice directed at any potential purchaser
that is a Plan or a plan subject to Similar Law, or at such purchasers generally.

**EUROPEAN UNION PROPOSED FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS TAX**

**The Proposed Financial Transactions Tax (“FTT”)**

On February 14, 2013, the European Commission published a proposal (the “Commission’s Proposal”) for a
Directive for a common FTT in Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia
and Slovakia (together, except for Estonia, the “participating Member States”). However, Estonia has since withdrawn
from participating.

The Commission’s Proposal has very broad scope and could, if introduced, apply to certain dealings in the Notes
(including secondary market transactions) in certain circumstances.

At the Economic and Financial Affairs Council meeting of June 14, 2019, the Participating Member States agreed
to continue negotiations on the basis of a joint French-German proposal based on the French financial transactions tax
model, which in principle would only concern shares of listed companies whose head office is in a Member State of
the European Union. However, such proposal is still subject to change until a final approval, the scope and timing of
which are uncertain. Additional EU Member States may decide to participate and Participating Member States may
decide to withdraw. Prospective holders of the Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to
the FTT.

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

Under the terms and conditions contained in a purchase agreement dated as of the date hereof, BNP Paribas is
acting as representative of the several initial purchasers of the Notes. We have agreed to sell to the initial purchasers,
and the initial purchasers have agreed, severally and not jointly, to purchase from us, the following principal amounts
of Notes set forth opposite their names below.

**Principal Amount of**

**Notes to be**

**Initial Purchaser** **Purchased**

BNP Paribas ................................................................................................................... €
Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. ........................................................................................ €
Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank ........................................................... €
ING Bank N.V., London Branch .................................................................................... €
UniCredit Bank AG ........................................................................................................ €
J.P. Morgan Securities plc .............................................................................................. €
Merrill Lynch International ............................................................................................ €
SMBC Nikko Capital Markets Limited .......................................................................... €
RBC Europe Limited ..................................................................................................... €
Citigroup Global Markets Limited ................................................................................ €
MUFG Securities EMEA plc .......................................................................................... €
Total: ............................................................................................................................. € 500,000,000

The purchase agreement provides that the initial purchasers of the Notes are obligated to purchase all of such
Notes if any are purchased. The purchase agreement provides that if an initial purchaser of the Notes defaults, the
purchase commitments of non-defaulting initial purchasers of the Notes may be increased or the offering may be
terminated. We have agreed in the purchase agreement that we will not offer or sell any of our debt securities (other
than the Notes) for a period of 60 days after the date of this offering memorandum without the prior consent of the
representative for the Notes.

The initial purchasers propose to offer the Notes initially at the relevant offering price on the cover page of this
offering memorandum. After the initial offering, the offering price may be changed. The initial purchasers may offer
and sell notes through certain of their affiliates. In addition, one or more of the initial purchasers may not be U.S.registered broker-dealers. All sales of the Notes in the United States will be made by or through U.S.-registered brokerdealers, which may include such affiliates of one or more of the initial purchasers.

The Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold within the United
States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons except to persons reasonably believed to be QIBs in reliance
on Rule 144A and to non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S. Each of the initial
purchasers has agreed that, except as permitted by the purchase agreement, it will not offer, sell or deliver the Notes
(i) as part of its distribution at any time or (ii) otherwise until 40 days after the later of the commencement of the
offering and the closing date, within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons, and it will
have sent to each broker/dealer to which it sells Notes in reliance on Regulation S during such 40-day period a
confirmation or other notice detailing the restrictions on offers and sales of the Notes within the United States or to,
or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons. Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by
Regulation S under the Securities Act. Resales of the Notes are restricted as described under “Transfer Restrictions.”

In addition, until 40 days after the commencement of the offering, an offer or sale of Notes within the United
States by a broker/dealer (whether or not it is participating in the offering) may violate the registration requirements
of the Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than pursuant to Rule 144A.

We and the Guarantors have agreed to indemnify the initial purchasers against liabilities, including liabilities
under the Securities Act, or to contribute to payments that they may be required to make in that respect.

The Notes are a new issue of securities for which there currently is no market. In addition, the Notes are subject
to certain restrictions on resale and transfer as described under “Transfer Restrictions.” We intend to apply for the

121


-----

listing of and permission to deal in the Notes on the Official List of TISE. However, we cannot guarantee that the
application to list the Notes on the Official List of TISE will be approved as of the issue date or any date thereafter,
that the permission to deal in the Notes will be granted or that the listing of the Notes will be maintained, and settlement
of the Notes is not conditioned on obtaining this listing. TISE is not a regulated market for the purposes of MiFID II.

Certain of the initial purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by
applicable law. They are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes, and any market-making may be
discontinued with respect to any or all series at any time at their sole discretion. Accordingly, no assurance can be
given as to the development or liquidity of any market for the Notes. If an active trading market for the Notes does
not develop, the market price and liquidity of the Notes may be adversely affected. If the Notes are traded, they may
trade at a discount from their initial offering price, depending on prevailing interest rates, the market for similar
securities, our operating performance and financial condition, general economic conditions and other factors.

You should be aware that the laws and practices of certain countries require investors to pay stamp taxes and
other charges in connection with purchases of securities.

In connection with the issue of the Notes, the Stabilizing Manager or persons acting on its behalf may over-allot
Notes or effect transactions with a view to supporting the market price of the Notes at a level that is higher than that
which might otherwise prevail. However, we cannot assure you that the Stabilizing Manager or persons acting on its
behalf will undertake stabilization action. Any stabilization action may begin on or after the date on which adequate
public disclosure of the terms of the offer of Notes is made and, if begun, may be ended at any time, but it must end
no later than the earlier of 30 days after the issue date of the Notes and 60 days after the date of the allotment of the
Notes.

In the ordinary course of their respective businesses, the initial purchasers and certain of their respective affiliates
have in the past and may in the future engage in commercial or investment banking or other transactions of a financial
nature with us, including the provision of certain advisory services and the making of loans to us and our affiliates,
for which they have received (or will receive) customary compensation. In particular, affiliates of certain of the initial
purchasers act as lenders under our Existing Credit Facilities, which are expected to be prepaid with the proceeds of
the offering of the Notes described herein. As a result, certain of the initial purchasers or their affiliates may receive a
portion of the net proceeds from this offering, and/or customary compensation for acting in such capacities. See “Use
of Proceeds” for more information. The Trustee is an affiliate of one of the initial purchasers, Deutsche Bank Securities
Inc.

In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the initial purchasers and their affiliates may make
or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and
financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such
investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of ours or our affiliates (including the
Notes). Certain of the initial purchasers or their affiliates that have a lending relationship with us or our affiliates
routinely hedge, and certain other of those initial purchases or their affiliates are likely to hedge, their credit exposure
to us and/or our affiliates consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, such initial purchaser
and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of
credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in securities (including potentially the Notes). Any such credit
default swaps or short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes. The initial purchasers and
their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in
respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or
short positions in such securities and instruments.

**Notice to Prospective Investors in the European Economic Area**

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or
otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who
is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; (ii) a customer within the
meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as amended, the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would
not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a “qualified investor”
as defined in Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended, the “Prospectus Regulation”).

122


-----

Consequently no key information document required by the EU PRIIPs Regulation for offering or selling the
Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or
selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the EU
PRIIPs Regulation.

This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes in any member state of the
EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a
prospectus for offer of the Notes. This offering memorandum is not to be considered a prospectus for the purposes of
the Prospectus Regulation and any relevant implementing measure in each member state of the EEA.

**Notice to Prospective Investors in the United Kingdom**

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or
otherwise made available to any retail investor in the UK. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is
one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No. 2017/565 as it forms
part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA
and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that
customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No.
600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (iii) not a “qualified investor” as defined in
Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No. 2017/1129 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK
Prospectus Regulation”).

Consequently no key information document required by the UK PRIIPs Regulation for offering or selling the
Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the UK has been prepared and therefore offering or
selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK may be lawful under the UK
PRIIPs Regulation.

This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes in the UK will be made
pursuant to an exemption under the UK Prospectus Regulation from a requirement to publish a prospectus for offers
of securities. This offering memorandum is not a prospectus for purposes of the UK Prospectus Regulation.

In the UK, this offering memorandum is being distributed only to and is directed only at (i) persons who are
“investment professionals” falling within Article 19(5) of the Financial Promotion Order, (ii) high net worth
companies, unincorporated associations and other bodies within the categories described in Article 49(2)(a) to (d) of
the Financial Promotion Order and (iii) any other persons to whom an invitation or inducement to engage in investment
activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the FSMA) in connection with the issue or sale of the Notes may
otherwise lawfully be communicated or caused to be communicated (all such persons together being referred to as
“relevant persons”). Any person who is not a relevant person should not act or rely on this offering memorandum or
any of its contents. Any investment or investment activity to which this offering memorandum relates is available only
to relevant persons and will be engaged in only with relevant persons.

and Ongoing Registrant Obligations. Any resale of the Notes must be made in accordance with an exemption from,
or in a transaction not subject to, the prospectus requirements of applicable securities laws.

Securities legislation in certain provinces or territories of Canada may provide a purchaser with remedies for
rescission or damages if this offering memorandum (including any amendment thereto) contains a misrepresentation,
provided that the remedies for rescission or damages are exercised by the purchaser within the time limit prescribed
by the securities legislation of the purchaser’s province or territory. The purchaser should refer to any applicable
provisions of the securities legislation of the purchaser’s province or territory for particulars of these rights or consult
with a legal advisor.

**TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS**

**Offer and Sale of the Notes**

The Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act or any securities laws of any other jurisdiction and
may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons except pursuant
to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act.
Accordingly, the Notes are being offered hereby only (1) to QIBs, in compliance with, and reliance on, the exemption
from the registration requirements of the Securities Act provided by Rule 144A and (2) pursuant to offers and sales to
non-U.S. persons that occur in “offshore transactions” outside of the United States in reliance upon Regulation S.
Because of these restrictions and those described below, purchasers are advised to consult legal counsel prior to

purchasers as follows:

discretion and that it and any such account is either:

(A) a QIB and such purchaser and each such account is aware that the sale to it is being made in reliance on

Rule 144A, or

(B) a non-U.S. person outside of the United States acquiring such Notes in reliance upon and in compliance

with Regulation S and if resident in a member state of the EEA or in the UK, it is not a retail investor
(as defined in this offering memorandum).

(2) It acknowledges that the Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act or any securities laws of

any other jurisdiction, and that they may not be offered, sold, pledged or otherwise transferred except as set

except:

(A) to the Issuer;

(B) so long as the Notes are eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144A, in compliance with Rule 144A to a

person whom the seller reasonably believes is a QIB purchasing for its own account or for the account
of another QIB to which notice is given that the transfer is being made in reliance on Rule 144A;

(C) outside the United States to a non-U.S. person in compliance with Regulation S;

(D) pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144 (if available);

counsel acceptable to us that such transfer is in compliance with the Securities Act;
